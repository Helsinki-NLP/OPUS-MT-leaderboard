Parliament does not support the freedom of Tymoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in the course of its reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to revoke the article which condemned the leader of the opposition, Julia Tymoshenko.
An amendment which would result in the release of the former Prime Minister in prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be of no use.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will hear the Tymoshenko appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the sentence is the political revenge of the regime; in the West the process has also been suspected of bias.
The proposal to abolish Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister had been convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes.
Libya's Victory
In the history of liberation, or insurrection, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Qaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert, and the war is over without him.
It's time to identify the winners.
Islamists generally win; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the ordinary Sharia Act, of which we have heard.
Libya would become a crime-free country, because the penalty for stealing was to cut off her hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society composed of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we would hardly wish for.
However, our way of life is neither unique nor better, and would probably not suit the Libyan population, for example.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic combatants have accepted help from the faithless.
Their only excuse is that they think that the attack by the North Atlantic was not led by an American general, but by God, whose greatness they glorified after each blow.
And in Libya, if you look for winners, the West is not one of them.
We've been involved in shooting, serving Islam, and our politicians have been rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of profit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about banishing the "crusaders."
Though without occupation would the oil companies get Libya's black gold almost for nothing?
It's probably not, and then the West can finally brag about the unselfish protection of civil rights.
Unless Sharia's followers put an end to it.
A new wave of crisis is beginning
France and the rest of Europe are now at the centre of investor attention.
A statistical storm flew over Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries published GDP data in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, with Germany and France showing growth.
Yet the debt market today is breaking record.
Not only are the investors looking for Italy; they now focus on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the countries of the eurozone in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries published their tentative estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by expected 0.5%; France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the initial information implied stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a pre-growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was stagnant; according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this has confirmed the downward trend in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts predicted.
Key Events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a pre-growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was stagnant compared to the previous quarter.
In the third quarter, Germany's economy grew by 0.5% based on both pre- and season data.
From July to September, both the eurozone and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 percent over the previous quarter, which matches analysts' projections.
Greece's economy showed a 52% reduction.
Its 10-year-old bond yields 28.45%.
The revenue of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is getting worse, the yields of Czech 1-year-old bonds remain about 4%.
In Germany it is said that the ECB is the last lender to save the situation.
The Czech team was selected by EURO.
In Montenegro, they won with a 1:0 score and celebrate an unexpected monetary prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully met the most difficult challenge of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and beautiful voice of Peter Jirachek, they won at 1:0.
In the second half, the Czech team was fortunate to retain a significant advantage after a home-grown match, and will rejoin the European championship.
IHNED.cz observed the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the loss of the team at the end; the great Czech; and heroic Jirachek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championship.
The excellent defence of the Czech team allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianicz and Vuccinc became the worst match ever, after losing two great opportunities.
The great Peter Czech is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football will earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute on, the game was very tense.
Both teams had difficulty in performing combinations; the game was most of the time in the middle of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the team of masters in the first half, and the long-range strikes over the defence line were carefully intercepted by Czech advocates.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students built a human shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
They thus wish to express their support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, student prayers were followed in front of the building by prayers for both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students built a human shield around the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant.
They have thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country's nuclear programme at the expense of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that everything showed that Iran had not abandoned attempts to acquire nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, student prayers at the entrance to the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant were followed by prayers for both the United States and Israel's death.
In the event of an attack directed at the maximum paralysis of the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, the installation in both Isfahan and Natanz, where the irradiation is taking place.
Eating obese children: No breakfast or sausage for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight; while 9 per cent of students are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to a recent study, obese children usually come from unhealthy families.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and the behaviours accompanying human beings for their or their healthy development.
For example, sausage occurs almost twice as often on tables as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19% of children suffering from obesity ate fries for dinner on the eve of an educational event called Obesity is not an accident.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports; however, this is true of most families of modern school children; only 15 percent of children say that their parents take time to engage in sports at least once a week.
The study was carried out among 900 children.
The study was carried out at the end of the previous school year; nearly 900 primary students throughout Bohemia participated in it.
The Obesity Event was not an incident carried out for the second consecutive year, with the support of Všeobecná zdravotní pojišovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students in grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Good diet and sufficient sport are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either overweight or obesity.
"For example, only half the interviewees said that they eat five meals a day, according to the breakfast- snack-lench-eating-eating scheme, and that's one of the indispensable conditions for proper diet," said one of the conclusions of the study.
No lunch and no sausage at night.
The experts warn that even relative details such as regular family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of school families eat breakfast together.
Most families have separate breakfasts.
The worst discovery is that in every tenth family, people don't eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the right day's diet.
The study found that fried food is more commonly used in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children regularly engage in sports, this figure decreases by more than half, to 15%, when it comes to their parents.
Create your own menu.
In another part of the study, the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to draw up their own menus based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged 12-15 are far from the ideal of healthy food."
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat, and sweet dishes.
"A particular concern is the great popularity of sweet cooling drinks," says the final part of the study.
As a main meal, the pasta beat a bird with a slight margin.
However, children showed little interest in beans, fish, and vegetables.
Seeking a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also showed that children were prepared to change their eating habits on the condition that they were provided with relevant information.
"Many members of the monitoring group showed a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they completed the study with obesity -- it's not an accident," said the project.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet cool drinks -- more children began to prefer them to just water.
In addition, children were more likely to note birds and fish as the main dish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and baking.
Stylist should also be a good therapist, say professionals.
In the first article on stylists' training, I visited the volume of information in introductory classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
lectures by three experts in this field; advice on the choice of clothes for non-standard characters; and a workshop on how this works in real life.
Next, more.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks we expect.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, (no man in the course) we talked about how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not entirely symmetrical.
One short neck, the other a boy's figure without proper shape, another weighs more than normal.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce broad shoulders, extend the neck or add the missing volumes.
We've been given advice on how to highlight the shape of women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. women with larger breasts and hips and narrow waist, without wearing them too preposterous.
For example, if the size difference between a waist and a thigh is so large that you can't pick up a skirt or a trouser, you should have at least one customized thing.
You will certainly not regret the investment, as the perfect sitting clothes are priceless.
In a custom-made skirt, you'll feel a lot better than the one that always moves down, rolls down, strips your waist, etc.
On the other hand, girls of boys' shapes may wear clothes with rups, appliance, embroidery or folding.
Given the abundance of such information and shapes, I'm glad I've got a whole week to realize all this.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we got.
Each student had to come up with two costumes for a celebrity: a day and a night.
We have to take into account their modern appearance, their style in their clothes, and the type of shape.
I'm going to wear a Miranda Kerr that you might know on Victoria's Secret advertising campaign.
I'm excited about myself because it's much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently recovered a ton (please note that I exaggerate), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them online, print and process them using graphical programs.
The Mudboard -- so called the result of the work -- then reflects our own style and the way we view graphics.
It's important to keep the graphical element of style in your head.
The stylist not only dresses real people, but creates food pages in magazines (based on specific instructions such as fancy bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Camenik told us about.
But it was only Sunday.
Stylist Needs Common Knowledge
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about the types of figures, revived three guests, experts in this field.
Stylist, Honza Obedience; fashion designer, Yakub Polanca; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one piece of clothes in different ways.
In this case, variety is the key to success.
For example, a coat-wrap can be worn normally, over jeans and shirts like a coat; but it can also be worn on an empty body, without clapping like a dress.
The other option is to roll your sleeves or lift your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I really appreciated the advice, "You have to know the rules perfectly for your work."
Then you can start breaking them,' Jacob told us.
Here I finally realized why we're putting together all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, whereas in fashion magazines we often see something very different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist should have more design options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So for a fancy view on ten pages (equivalent to ten suits) I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, a piece of clothes often looks and works in combination with others, quite different from the reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honsa Obedience has confirmed that often image and style are half success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing voice, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still rather cold.
Even famous people often think it's unnecessary (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we have to expect them to call us a different (less) size than what they actually wear.
And then we go to Google and we figure out if the tabloids have written anything about some famous fatter/lost, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that for a stylist, it was not enough to understand fashion and be able to pick up clothes.
Our job is basically to communicate with the people we dress; so it's important to be a good therapist.
To be able to measure people, not to tolerate them and to hold their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look through her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can't throw away all her clothes, telling her that her clothes are awful."
"Find at least a few things you can commend, and advise that you can wear with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that he should specifically insert the working bag.
This is the bag you bind around your waist to wear everything you need.
In addition to obvious things such as sticky rollers, sticky rollers or English pins, it should contain nylon threads (stylists use it when filming certain objects such as purses or hats), special clips to bind the tissue on the back in case the clothes are too large (bubbles and similar objects are prohibited because they spoil clothes) or a sewing kit.
In order to distract ourselves from lectures and to gain some practical experience, we have learned to do the right thing on the soles of our shoes.
Even during filming in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can be damaged, not to mention shooting on the street.
So we started the sticker.
You don't have to touch your shoes with scissors to avoid ruining them.
This requires real skill.
It was a pleasure to see Mario commending my work.
I didn't like these skills.
That's just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm beginning to realize that being a professional stylist isn't that easy to say.
V Need for Speed: Running is happening in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a careless walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
Ambiguities had been satisfied to a certain extent, but that was not important, since no one clearly wanted to do any extra work.
Before the release with a new version of the "Flug" subtitle, there was a lot of hope.
It was expected to move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the genre of the racing games.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main character got out of the car and ran.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end much is different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression is corrupted by some unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for years.
So it's actually not a mistake, it's a demonstration of the inexplicable laziness of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You become part of a history whose main hero, Jack, solves some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
This idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of ten steps divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes its own route, and the individual steps take place in a different and interesting environment.
So it doesn't feel like it's the same thing all the time in the game.
Despite the fact that the graph is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, it's nice to look at some tracks.
And yet the game doesn't give rise to strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, the autumn suburbs, or high in the snowy mountains is a pleasure.
Besides, racing occasionally revives an unusual detail.
In the desert, for example, you fall into a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to get caught in a hole.
Separate races are fairly well organized.
There are only a few species, but that's enough.
For a while you're trying to beat a few opponents (in fact, a normal race); then you're trying to improve the time (standard race with a stopwatch); or you're competing with one adversary.
Besides all that, you occasionally run into a police force that makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you would expect (only three to be exact).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for a game because it's not boring; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game funnier.
The race model follows the pattern of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a disadvantage.
If you're looking for a simulation of real life, you're going to have to look elsewhere.
However, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although there are better options on the market.
So far, so good.
However, after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect this game to change and crash, but if you have no idea how your car behaves, something's wrong.
Usually, bypassing or passing cars in a dense flow, you sometimes touch the other car slightly, and yet sometimes, in a almost similar situation, your car starts to spin wildly.
Or it's broken.
It's not that important because of the reboot system, but it's enough to ruin fun.
Restarting is done so that if you break up or go far off the track, the game returns you to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five relaunchs are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work out, but you can't totally rely on it.
Sometimes reboots are not enough, and you have to memorize a separate section of the race.
An important disadvantage of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same place.
For example, some turns have to go in a certain way, otherwise you just don't fit in.
In other cases, you meet a civil car in a certain location in the same configuration, whether you come first, fifth, five seconds earlier, or a minute later.
This is particularly frustrating in situations where you see your opponent passing easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, while when you get there, the machines are already positioned so that you either need to drive around or slow down.
It doesn't matter when you're next to them; it's always happening right in front of you.
The opponents have other advantages.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of time, the same opponent overtakes you at the same place.
This is particularly evident at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you drive in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you no matter what.
The thing is, when he drives in front of you, he makes you look worse, resulting in one or more accidents on this site.
You can understand an attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get irritated quickly.
Too bad, because despite the simple model of driving, the game is exciting and sometimes so overwhelmed with events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
No matter what makes you miss -- a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or something.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the gas stations along the way, because that's where your car can switch on, even though in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
Machines are divided into three categories.
Sport cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars for direct highway sections; and exotic super-sport car for technical driving, for example on curved mountain routes.
The main story mode is closely associated with the challenge mode; it is a race on individual sites that you will learn during the game.
Here you win for your personal affairs both the coins and the glasses common to the challenges and story regimes.
Many opportunities are available for higher driving, from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is related to the Autolog online function, which, among other things, compares your performance with that of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; it's an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (let's think so) where you run down the tracks in the dark (let's think so).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's say so) when a train hits you suddenly from behind, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For a few days, our editors talked about whether at the time of the game's creation no one really thought for a second, or whether its creators really thought we were such idiots.
The technical part of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression from the video series is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
While it is a pity that at some critical moments the quality of the record is sometimes rather weakening.
This is particularly true in cases with a large number of players, where a good recording would not really help you either.
Sound is in order; soundtrack is on amateur.
To please as wide a youth audience as possible, the soundtrack's got different styles in it; but it's unlikely that many people will buy a game because of its music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: The escape is rather random.
If the game were to avoid obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that running is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a feeling of incompleteness.
Of course, it's a good fun, but prepare yourself for failings to blind you like a spotlight at the airport.

Embassador to the EU Witzenov:
The Czechs have a reputation for being disobedient and sceptic about the euro.
"The Lisbon Compact has caused considerable differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a violent war."
"It takes five or six years before the situation gets any more stable, calms down, and all players get used to their new roles," the EU ambassador, Milena Vicenov, began his lecture severely at the Faculty of Law.
She has shown the extent to which she maintains the motto "A clear and open to Europe" in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual institutions of the EU and their relationship so easily and clearly that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law would be envious.
Moreover, Vicenov commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"At first, critics said he was just a gray office mouse who could not play any role; I must say, everyone was amazed at how well he did his role."
"He is a man who can listen at the same time to the twenty-seven participating countries, well communicate with them and have a clear idea of which direction the EU should develop."
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? Which number should I call?"; that is, as an important step towards the unification and greater transparency of the Union's policies towards countries such as China or India.
Nobody's going to ban our cheeses.
The Vicenova went on to focus on a programme key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the successful Czech presidency the previous year.
The Czechs had been dealing with an imminent financial crisis; they had overcome the crisis and had organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the Government's dismissal at the time was a negative phenomenon that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Currently, Czech representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the Ambassador has said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing ferocation.
Moreover, a new seven-year EU budget needs to be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and economical, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and which countries would receive less; and all those issues would be in the coming programme.
The ambassador recapitulated the key messages she had brought to Brussels: "On Europe, in a clear language."
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon, which no one understands.
How citizens can understand that in Brussels people don't try to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone's going to ban our cheeses.'
It will also make better use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multispeed Europe - Our Future
He claims that the Czechs are regarded as Euro-sceptic; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive aspects of things.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors have been responsible: for example, the modestness of our candidates and their failure to write motivational letters; and for a little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful Czech presidency, it highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what's the occasion of the meeting, the Visegrad group again?" and he's not quite happy about it.
In the future, the Union of Vicenov is awaiting mainly new strict rules for the budget policies of the States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone."
"We have a Schengen zone, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that countries that want to be united, while those that don't want to stay away."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be truly a two-speed Europe," awaits Vicenov.
In this respect, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in advancing the rule that all issues concerning the whole EU should be discussed by all participating countries, not just those belonging to the eurozone.
Mark history:
The IBM inventor is entering the second century of his existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best reflects the IMB strategy, the closest one will probably be "long term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded over a century ago.
The company's longevity was laid by its first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
He believed in his motto that many of the world's problems could be solved easily if people wanted to think.
His motto "Think!" thus became the image around which the life of the future giant was unfolding (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because it remained faithful to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around itself.
In our first hundred years, this has enabled us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years we hope to achieve even more, says Samuel J. Palmizano, the current head of the company, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex System
In the 1930s Watson came up with the issue of care for employees as Batia in the Czech Republic -- IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms, and a complex bonus system for the best inventors and employers.
The long-term relationship between IBM and consumers is equally advanced.
From the beginning, the company found a brilliant use for talented people, which was one of the first global companies to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Concurs with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan under which a woman, Virginia Romeo, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked for IBM for thirty years; she is currently director of sales, marketing and development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, during which many future innovations have emerged.
No wonder there's a lot of ideas -- about half a million people working in the company.
A well-reputed organization
The firm's strong position in business is ensured by strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, from the point of view of the IBM concept, it was rather an organization rather than a technology company," said the economist professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM Rosabet Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business problems by using technology," adds George Colony from a consulting firm called Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or "Blue Giant," as they call it in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies.
It seems to be the most universal technology company -- hardware and software development; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services -- from servers to nanotechs.
She owns the largest number of patents in all US technology companies, and five of her employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a bar code and a floppy disk.
With 220 billion dollars in market capitalization data, IBM this year became the second largest technology company (first in Apple's company) and overcame Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look Forward
Not all of its products tasted like customers and fit into the age. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online; and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is driven by a forward movement, you cannot be emotionally attached to the past," said Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundation on multiple platforms -- if they don't work, it abandons them.
This distinguishes it from, for example, its Microsoft competitor, who is based on and is experiencing a fall on Windows, his operating system.
Promising technology
IBM's main revenue comes from services, and about one fifth each comes from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990 the capital was half the size, it was the strongest manufacturing company in the world.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth 15 billion dollars, while at the same time it has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the Great Depressive.
Until IBM seems to have damaged the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has risen by a record 120 percent; the company's net income has steadily increased.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything except its own values.
So we can expect that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexibilous giant will handle the situation.
IBM history: from a cheese knife to a space flight.
The IBM (IBM) was founded in New York a century ago, and its original name, "Creation, Tabulation, Recording" was rather complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924, which was originally the name of the brand used for the Canadian and South American branches.
The foundation of the future IBM was based on a merging of four companies, the history of which began in the 1880s.
They owned technology, such as the legendary watch, i.e. the watch that fixes the time when employees come and leave their jobs.
The architect of the new company was a businessman, Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also head of the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the director of the competition company, to help him run the company.
The manager then moved the founder of IBM to the shadows of whatson's ideas remain the basis of a firm culture and identity.
Watson was the head of the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name makes clear, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, from raw knives and cutters to cash machines.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, the revenue doubled to $9 million, and a massive expansion of the company to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his place in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM and IBM computers helped NASA control space flights -- to Mercure, Saturn, and 1969 -- a man's flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first family of computers in 1964, the IBM line System 360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to a Chinese company named Lenovo, simultaneously buying the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting office, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high value added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is to make sound use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned and to improve the road and urban management.
In the commercial sphere, IBM recently introduced a Smarter Common platform that helps businessmen control the entire trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, the first country to be located simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-level research team is also working on speech recognition.
Richtarchov about his unfaithful husband:
Yveta, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarjova (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtarch (53), became the bodyguard and lover of Yveta Bartoshov (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and come home.
However, she no longer wanted to wait, and she set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa may come home, but not as my partner," explained Richardsov.
When Darina Richtarchov gave his house the bed of Barthosov in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Yvette to leave Rizjan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly confessed that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to accept her husband's affair; and now she finally said good-bye to him.
Richtarch doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richard and Barthosov ever part, his wife will not accept him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will banish him."
"But he'll end his days not as my favorite, lost and found old fool, but as the man with whom I'm connected," said Richtarchov, adding that she had already been released from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
As long as Joseph had nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yveta, I won't change it."
"My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union still works; I'm responsible for repair, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly normally, except we don't share the bed any more," said the Richtarch to the Blask magazine.
He claims that if he finds a new love, he won't interfere with it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has and who she has a friend with.
I know it's my fault I fell in love with Yvette and I bear full responsibility," concluded Joseph.
Worse women's habits: Do they touch you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad women's habits, they usually list them all immediately.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines, describing a few women's habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your other half complains you're always shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like making purchases on big sales?
If so, your shopping is a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping somehow.
Yet, which one of you would refuse to go to dress shops to look for the perfect sitting clothes and to try it on (preferably in different colours) in the dressing rooms?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it can be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait outside...
Always Disappointed
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilograms -- maybe I should start doing gymnastics."
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you're part of a group of women who are obsessive about their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men literally have an allergic effect on their partner's constant complaints about their appearance.
The strong gender also accepts that the more often such complaints occur, the more women irritate them.
What matters most is order and purity.
It's like an endless story.
Cleaning the glass, cleaning the vacuum, cleaning the floor, cleaning the dust, cleaning the bathroom--at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for coming to a clean cafe in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on the window in the living room, which was so hard to clean?
If you suffer from this "disposition," try to realize that it is not right to fall into extremes; and that order and purity should not be the first place in your family.
A harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationship as well as your entire family.
Aim to Command
"Throw your underwear into the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet dish towels should not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner multiple times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if men realized that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Chats
Some women enjoy gossiping, insulting, and intrigued others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to talk about who, where, who, how, and why.
From time to time, perhaps each of us is spreading gossip.
Let's be frank, that's probably the nature of all women.
However, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise others, especially in women's working groups, who pose a great danger to their environment.
The results of the Yagrees and the Doctors' broadcasts helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL game on Monday, two successful showbacks of Yaromir Yagra's hockey attacker helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the Carolina ice, and he became once again the most successful Czech player in the game.
In both cases, Claude Giroux used the experience of a thirty-year-old star; he added another show and was declared the best player in the game.
The two successful match shows also belonged to Yakubu Doctor, who played the same team as Yagob.
After the match, the Yagra told the foreign journalists that he had predicted Girous a wonderful evening.
"I told him before the match he'd score a hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel this sort of thing," the Yagre explained, after whose actions Girous scored at the first opportunity that Flyers gave.
A little later the team's second goal also had a "black trail."
The locking Harrikanes Vorachek took over the puck and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
A second before the first break, the home player Patrick Dwayne reduced the gap at the multiple advantage, but at the beginning of the second half, the Flyers re-led.
Especially Giroux.
After his performance, he scored a third goal; his strike was later turned into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," said the Yager, commending his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," added the Jagr.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Ruuta and Dwayne's punishment, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complication prevented Matt Reid, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our area."
"He hit the puck, I hastened, and Reed went to the far edge."
"I was aimin' at it and glad it worked," described Warokzek's impression from the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the Montreal team, Jaroslav Spaček, did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an injured upper body.
Together with an experienced defender, Canada lost its two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomasz the Plecan couldn't kill during one of their attacks.
More than lost glasses, the home coach was upset with a lot of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five advocates.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"No matter what, there's nothing we can do about it, we just have to accept it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
"What was our weakness," added the defender of P.K. Subban
After thirty attacks by the Czech holkepper Onjay Pavelus helped Winnipegs beat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets' goals, which interrupted the fifth series of defeats, were filled with five different players.
Evolution of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five government tourist agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Šedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, the tourist agencies of the time were mostly selling tours to the socialist bloc.
Thus, on vacation Czech tourists travelled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea, on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Bulgaria (Balaton).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972, when we were able to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which caused considerable restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually to socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovakia citizen wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was needed from that country; otherwise, an individual journey was impossible.
At the time, tourist agencies offered to travel to the West, but either they had to wait in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or they had to have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Currency permission was needed to travel to the West, and was not given to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without monetary permission it was not possible to obtain money (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
Most often the Czechs spent their vacations at home, resulting in large numbers of cottages and summer homes, a habit that still exists today.
Since 1989, tourists in the Czech Republic have thus experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989 vacation to the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our journeys, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox, which we no longer realize, is that before 1989 we could not freely visit Croatia, which is now the most popular one, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very beginning of 1990 the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring countries in Western Europe was cancelled, resulting in a huge wave of short trips, mostly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakia couldn't afford to go to the West, and everybody wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income at the time was scarce for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourists during that period was the desire to bring their own food (conserves, salts, etc.) in order to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, and after decades, our tourists can finally freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income rose, leading to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled tourist agencies to prepare regular flights by charter companies; compared to the past, air travel has now become extremely cheap because of the ability to order bulk discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit nearly all the developed world except the US, which made our journeys even easier.
The next significant event in the history of post-revolution travel occurred in 2000, and the great demand has led to the historic first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have brought Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flight from the Czech Republic will take 12 exotic routes.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our post-revolution development, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US cancelled the requirement for a visa for Czech tourists, and our country has thus permanently joined the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history, they spent over 15,000 crowns on a person during a foreign vacation, including their destination costs.
The general assembly has to choose a president, the threat of a path returns.
For about five months, Czech football had no president, and there is a risk that Ivan Goszek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAÇR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburka on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on the rules of the elections.
Without this, the voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yindrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Paclik are eager to lead Czech football.
He left his post in June, and he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong person who would lead the football in the future.
However, the era of Goszek once again plunged football into a dispute between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became apparent on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The General Assembly had for nothing arrived at the National House in Prague, Smychov, because the talks had remained blocked, not just the election procedure.
No agreement had been reached on who had the right to vote at the general meeting, only the legal representatives or officials to whom the credentials had been granted.
This point has since been partially resolved by the State Institute and the Rights, which recommended that representation based on the powers granted would not be possible.
The debate over the rules of elections, however, continues.
Nor did the Executive Board much help, although at its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary, it is mostly concerned with this matter.
Submissions of voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do we get to round three and avoid a panic?
"The issue is whether to follow the established standards or find another model," says one of the vice presidents of FAchR Dushan Freedom, who represents professional football at the association's office.
Based on the model provided by the statute, the winner of the third round is a candidate who has received much support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree to a compromise by considering the winner of a candidate with the largest number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that, as a whole, the winner must obtain at least two thirds of the vote.
"Then, at least, the two previous rounds would then have lost their meaning; that would totally reject the concept of the two chambers," he said, "Freedom agrees with Moravia's arguments; it would be better not to change the rules and vote according to existing rules.
Some unexpectedly, Tomasz Paclik agrees with his opinion, although according to the estimates of the rules of the elections set by the statute, Pelto is offered more than any other candidate.
"I'd like the elections to take place as far as possible by statute."
"I want to avoid all possible representational nonsense, as at the previous general meeting," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is for the first time a candidate; and in his remarks he mostly contradicted Platet.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He trusted that the new President would be known in Nimburca; he also hoped that the candidates would work together in a constructive manner in the future.
"All emotion will calm down after today's expected national team's European championship."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to work together," says the representative of Applenuts, who, of the three candidates, has the most experience in football management at both the professional and the regional levels.
Reichl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"Not between Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"It may cause another breakdown of the general meeting."
"I hope common sense wins," said Rachel.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, some talks took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was to be carried, among others, by the Vice Presidents Dalibor Kouchera and Raichl to Podgorica, did not leave Prague this morning because of a technical failure, and sought an alternative to transport part of the Executive Committee to the location of the replay match.
After all, a meeting at the level of a minister expected on Wednesday may become decisive.
The Minister for Education, Young People and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like to see the parties in the strongest sports association in the country come to an agreement.
There is much at stake: government subsidies; football creditability; and a planned common meeting with a new Czech sports directorate following Saska's financial problems.
Paclik is taking up the Presidential struggle because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, Plzen's leader, Tomasz Paclik, had seen a strong candidate who would have met all his requirements for the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAÇR), he would not have even claimed a high office.
"If I had a decent candidate, I would have fought for him and I wouldn't have fought for him myself."
"But no such person has yet been found," said Paclik ŠTK.
Paclik's motive to fight against Miroslav Pelta and Yindrich Reichl is to try to prevent Pellet, the alleged favourite of the elections, from joining the FA ChR office.
Moreover, Paclik stresses that if he wins, he will not be president until the next general meeting is scheduled in 2013.
In the future, he would like this post to be occupied by an experienced top manager, not too connected with football life.
"I've talked to a few people who might have been in mind."
"It was awful for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they didn't even want to have anything to do with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, the main dispute between Paclik and Pelto is related to the latter's relationship with Roman Berbrom, President of the Regional Football Association in Plzen; Berber is a man of conflicting reputation, known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, who can influence the voices of the general assembly.
Paclik therefore considers it inappropriate for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will not change, and football will not move on."
"With the backing of Burber, a capable businessman, it would be even more damaging to football," said Paclik.
He hinted at the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name had been recorded during telephone tapping during the corruption investigation; Pelette had managed to avoid the sentence.
"I don't know what the reputation of winning Pelta would be for football."
"And as we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, and he now makes no mention of his earlier saying that he'll "sell the Plzen Club if Pelta becomes president."
If Paclik wins Thursday, he could imagine cooperating with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Rachel, whom Paclik supported before the general meeting in September, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce him to the team."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't have a nose in things I don't know about either," said Paclik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judicial team led by Ludec Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Dumkov.
Paclik claims he'll risk running an association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer he has run the Plzen team, which, with his help, celebrated its first triumph in May.
"I have the power to make the football environment change, support the change for the better."
"Restrict the influence of certain groups of persons who are inclined to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, resulting in abhorrent situations," said Paclik; he did not hide his antipathy, for example, with the Director of Sparta, Daniel Cretinski.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAchR and the Czech olympics Committee, with which it will lobby at the highest political level for more money for sports from the lottery fees.
"That's one of the key things the new president should be trying to do."
"If the money is taxed, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must make clear where the money will go," he said.
Paclik does not consider his association with the Plzen Club to be a burden, although he claims that President FAchR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to the Applet, and Rachel's to the Prague Duck.
"That's not the perfect option."
"And yet I don't see any sense in the hypocritical transfer of my shares to the Plzing Club to anyone else if I'm going to go back in six months," said Paclik.
Pelta promised a new FAchR rule that would avoid the Pat's Chosen One.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the president's candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for new FAchR rules in order to avoid future debate about election rules.
Before the Nimburca talks on Thursday, the functionary of the Applets remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the election struggle will seriously distract the expected success of our football team today.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general assembly, and the two-month delay could therefore be useful to him in order to resist his idea of football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the President to be famous on Thursday."
"They feel it's time for someone to run an association," says a man mostly associated with the Yablonese club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the Association's Executive Committee.
This gives him reason to believe that he is experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believed that the current problems were caused by the euphoria that prevailed during Ivan Gosek's reign.
"Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at a general meeting in June."
"If different means of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September," said Pelta.
He treated the renaming of the key civil association document as a false goal for the delegates.
"If I become president, I'll consider it my personal responsibility, and I'm going to take on my personal responsibility if this attempt turns out to be a failure."
"It's a fundamental question without which we can't exist," said Pelt.
Besides, he says he's not trying to single out himself against the background of his opponents.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Yindrich Reichl, whom he valued for legal education; he was well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should be his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Paclik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been in football for over a year and has made some success."
"Either way, his attacks were unfaithful, and many people were surprised at his campaign methods."
"And so some of them now doubt his true identity," said Pelta about his competitor.
He considers his knowledge of football to be his main weapon, from the lowest level of competition to the national team.
The national team is expected to represent the entire football team.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian case or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"After that, I would focus on the talks with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for the entire football game," a forty-year-old candidate said ŠTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football head would not result in the dismissal of the staff.
"I'll need to know the employee's instructions." That was his insurance message, where a prolonged period of power causes a comprehensible nervousness.
Despite the current devastating scenarios associated with the planned general meeting, he trusted that the delegates would come to Nimburk on Thursday for a reason.
"If the only issue is how to hold elections in the third round, we can handle it."
"Football needs the trust he can only gain by finally choosing his leader," said Pelt, who, two days before the key day of his career as a functionary, remains optimistic.
Reichl promises that under his leadership the FA ChR will become active
If, at a Thursday meeting, Jeinrich Richl, the current vice president, becomes president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association are said to be dissatisfied.
Rachel promises that if he's elected, it's time for hard work.
He wants to make changes in the system and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the Bohemians; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money into football; and to continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Goszek.
"As President, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, professional football and youth soccer events."
"That's not what I'm going to say, I'm going to do it myself," said Richle in his interview for ŠTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to share the powers of the executive committee so that each member will focus on a particular area."
"I will carefully assign tasks so that in each of these segments football will take great steps forward."
"It probably won't please many people, because it would mean hard work, not just criticism of others' work," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the soccer movement allegedly caused him to doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks in my wheels and question my every move," he explained his doubts.
"At the same time, many people told me I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
"It's a trust I can't get away with," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Goszek.
"A great deal of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to cross it all."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, were elected, the situation in the Association might return to the one before Goszek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and this is something in which Mirek Pelta is hardly competent."
"It's surrounded by people who would play soccer so that it's accessible only to the chosen ones."
"I can be accused of a lot of things, but certainly not of subjectivity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he denied the accusation that he would only be President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about splitting the second league into the Czech and Moravian sections, whose winners would continue the struggle in the first league."
"It will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravia teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Rachel.
While Plzen's manager, Tomasz Paclik, has joined the president's struggle, he dares not appreciate his chances of winning.
"Well, I still have strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its vice president, and I see that I have made some obvious progress," said Raichl.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of association.
Claiming that Pelta was "excluded from the process of regaining creditworthiness to Czech football," he considers the other opponent, Paclik, to be a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzen this year."
"If he is chosen, I hope he will continue what Ivan Goszek has begun, without significant changes in the staff of the Committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his own sake," said Rachel about his opponent.

Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can test the incredible water of Europe and relax their tired body in a jacuzzi after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing Iris Meder had been unable to do during his research trips for the last year and a half: without his bathing suit.
While lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the taste of the well-formed dome, swam to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired carefully restored swimming pools in the style of ar-nuo.
She hurried to add each enjoyable pool to her notebook -- with important details about building and building history.
Architecture historian Meder examined more than 200 swimming pools -- and now gathered impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden, where everything went, from the public pools in Munich to the historic swimming-houses in the Black Forest and the "functional concrete buildings" in Downus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited the bathing-rooms in Italy, the Czech Republic, France, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in the water things are different.
The only shortcoming is that navigators must accept the blue cafeteria tiles and the smell of Chlorine, while runners can breathe with the tempting smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyful bird-crying in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so awful," said a woman living in Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Pooling and exquisite oils in sauna is a healthy factor in bathing, because Meder thinks all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure to the eyes if the builders take on this kind of work. "Instead of the floor in the pool you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles, and tramplins.
An illustrated 190-page version of "The Joy of bathing" contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oasis and makes you want to jump into the water.
Meder's water collector found several outstanding copies during a study in Hungary.
She found nitrate-rich water in a cave in the Cave of the Caves in Misjkults-Tapolc and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a building built in the form of a bottle (Városi Termálfordö in Yasberen) and excellent therapeutic baths, such as the 100-year-old Seteni baths in Budapest.
Of the many warmed open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, you can see all Zurich from the bathing-room on the roof, or you can see the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anton, and there's a window in the steam room that allows you to see what's happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design is waiting for swimsuits in Langenfeld, and the Aqua-Café in Etzel looks like an UFO just landed in the Alps.
In winter, it rises a steam of three open shells, which seems very small in the background of the Ectal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwartzwald
Meder's pool collector didn't see the smell of chloor in every pool.
A lot of thermal baths smell like gray, and the Arpade ducts in Bekeshchab smell so much of oil that it might be hard for you to believe that you're in a healthy source.
The smell is caused by alkaline carbonate, and the water is almost black from the sulfur, which sticks to the skin as you sink into the pool, which is a healthy experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was at some point disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places, and when she tried to visit the open pond of the Czech Dome in Lugotsovitz, she found that the area was covered.
The hotels, designed by the architect Dushan Jurkowitsch in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked in the sighted windows of the red-white-yellow building in Ar-nuo style, she saw weeds growing between the cafeteria tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by hot trails was the amazing swimming pool in Schwartzwald, the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Willbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction, and you will find not only the neo-Roman elements of the period after construction in 1844, but also the Moorite Alhambra Hall, which was added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace -- the favorite swimming pool of the Iris Meder pools -- and not just because it comes from the Schwartzwald.
"This is a real achievement -- so skillful to combine such different architectural styles," said Meder.
Dumping into a thermal pool in such a palace is obviously a secondary occupation.
Agriculture speculative
Deutsche Bank investigates trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tives
Will the Deutsche Bank stop trade in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann assigned the working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the poor around the world.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
For German citizens, the situation is clear: according to one study, 84 per cent of Germans consider it inappropriate that banks speculate on farm products such as wheat and corn.
Two thirds of those surveyed demanded that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade compounded the problems faced by the world's poor.
The findings were drawn from a study carried out by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report's author, Harald Schumann, shows that world commodity exchange rates raise prices -- and banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The campaign of consumer advocates is directed directly against the head of the Bank of Deutsche Joseph Akkermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are traded in the same way.
Originally, commodity prices were intended as a means of protecting traders from price swings.
However, most experts now agree that the players have given up supply and demand rules and are profited at the expense of the poor.
Unlike the United States competitors, Akkermann responded to criticism, and he promised to investigate the charges and said that no trade “is worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank”.
In accordance with SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the charges contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods can decrease or stop altogether.
Akkermann is working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, highlighting his critical attitude to the financial sector. "The price of food prices is a glaring example of how banks now act recklessly against common interests."
As the bank's main lobbyist, Akkermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
"Decede Bank must remove all investments that pay for food prices from the Portfolio," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if it's about hungry people or the Duchess Bank's reputation."
A rapid reaction by Akkermann at first is surprising, but in the meantime the director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before he ended his stay in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not join the observation board as scheduled.
Removing the disputed speculation in the food market could improve its image.
Nor did he have to take care of the costs; the consequences would have to be borne by his successor.
One in two would refuse to invest in goods.
Foudwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, over 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
The study was published by Bode on Tuesday and was carried out for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on November 7 and 8, and 1001 people took part.
No more than 11 per cent believe that investments that rely on food prices are accepted by the Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such trade; according to the study, one in two would withdraw the contributions that eventually lead to speculation of goods.
Forty-three percent recommended leaving the bank, and 49 percent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st century House in Vienna
Pavilion in New Place
Ingeborg Winsowski
An architectural history of ups, downs and downs, and a happy end. The 1958 Austrian Pavilion for the World Exposition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, a wasteland and was abandoned.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian pavilion, designed by Carl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Expo in Brussels, is a famous example of modern post-war architecture with its simple, glass-shaped halls, which have expressed confidence in technological progress.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix in Architecture in 1958 for its light floating structure of steel and glass.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built an Austrian pavilion at the next World Expo.
After all, he became famous for the world in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder BMW and her sister, a bowl-shaped building.
The pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss garden near the Southern Station of Vienna, transformed and opened as a Museum of the 20th century in 1962 -- and is often referred to as the 20th century House for that reason.
Anyway, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and space reasons -- there were no walls on which to hang artworks, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house had been empty since 2001, and its condition had become worse and worse.
Architecture Adolf Krishanitz has now restored a pavilion called the 21st century House and will be used as a Museum of Modern Art.
This museum is a branch of the Bellvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibit on Tuesday evening, in all ways a joyful event.
Ánnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Bellvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new beginning.
Husslein-Arcko, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a figure artist in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, persuaded politicians and custodians to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private contributions, and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was to contain a permanent exhibition of Fritz Watruba's foundation, a cafe and a bookstore, along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict control of & restricted budget
Krishanitz was then the perfect candidate for the project.
He was famous, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secsion, Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied at the University of Technology of Vienna, and the pavilion was a "exclusively important place" where he attended the "almost weekly" exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the tasks that were in front of the building, a building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and converted.
The problems encountered during the last reconfiguration were much more serious, and the building was an energy absorber, says Krishanitz.
Window profiles on the glass facade had been replaced, glass-enhanced safety glass had been inserted, and the glass roof had been replaced with high-powered safety glass.
Steel walls of the heat bridge have been enhanced or replaced and the ceilings have been removed with asbest.
The two lower floors created space for the new use of the building, and the falling light well between the building and the street provides lighting -- almost a new building, but still a beautiful Schwanzer pavilion.
Original external doors were kept, and the building was painted in the old red-brown colour of protection against corrosion.
The theater hall is the same as it used to be.
It's all under strict control of the museum administration and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and would have been approved by the Museum Authority," said Krishanitz, pointing to an irregular floor in the cellar.
The building remained flexibly and lightly, despite limitations, problems and transformation.
Krishanitz recently remarked that the Brussels pavilion was rude--a typical story of "copling in town."
Such an architecture is "always out of place" and nevertheless wants to "stimulate real awareness."
The 21st century house is in the right place, because the city's planning has had unexpected success, and the completely rebuilt main station's "quartet" with offices and real estate grows around the Swiss garden.
The 21st century house may be accompanied by the second building of Krishanitz, a collector of Francesca von Habsburg, who has acquired a temporary exhibition hall in Berlin and is reported to be holding talks with the city about its location next door to the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multi-million dollar winter crisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced a crisis plan to avoid cancelling trains in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The costs will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter trains being cancelled and delayed.
Referring to the Deutsche Bahn internal crisis plan, the newspaper Bill reports that investments totalling about 300 million euros are planned by 2015.
Investment is intended to improve the performance of locomotives and railway networks even under extreme weather conditions.
The number of internal and engaged staff involved in cleaning snow from tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before the start of work and 90% of the required arrows within four to five hours.
Rudiger Groube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancelling and late trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport because she was short of reserves at a time when weather conditions were declining.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some late arrivals of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE train axis much more frequently for many years after one of the ICE trains had broken down at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay millions of pounds of fine in the United States
New troubles followed the unrest around Joseph Akkermann, Director General of the Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a fine in the United States of America of £4 million.
As if the Deutsche Bank had little trouble at home, the past industrial giant in the United States had now caught him up; Deutsche Bank, with its head office in Kraft, will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to calm the dispute following the collapse of the five largest credit union financial crisis.
The problem was the sale of bonds.
The NCUA, a financial market manager, blames a number of major banks for using false promises to trick credit union into buying their financial products.
The value of the bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and led to a fall in credit union.
"We're glad to have solved this problem without the parties going to court," said the representative of Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank did not plead guilty in the agreement.
The same is true of Citigroup, who has agreed to pay 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the prompt reaction of both banks.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA) is responsible for US credit associations and interferes with bankruptcy processes to protect consumers' contributions.
The NCUA struggles to compensate for billions of damages.
This is the first such agreement.
The manager also drew attention to other major banks and in the summer brought a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Doubtful bonds are so-called security, secured by a pool of mortgages.
They're backed up by internal debt.
This determined the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble broke in the US real estate market in 2007.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life on the brink of a financial crisis in September 2008.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still struggling with the storm.
A large number of claims have been submitted by investors and regulators, demanding compensation or punishment for fraudsters.
Behind the largest wave of claims is the FDHA.
It blames the 18 largest international banks for having bought about 200 billion dollars in bond from US credit organizations Fannie Mae and Fredie Mac.
Deutsche Bank is also at risk of being tried by FHFA for numerous agreements with a total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The manager requires a bank with a head office in Kraft to take responsibility for the “substantial loss” but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche The Bank dismissed the claims as groundless and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests 10 billion in IBM
Buffet's financial guru actively invests in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth over ten billion dollars.
So far, the largest American investor, Warren Buffett, has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM's annual report changed his view of investments in this industry.
According to Buffet, he should have known much earlier that IBM first offered services and bought computer systems for the IT Departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment was seen as a knight's act.
IBM, an IT industry Veteran, has now won the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the US Business Channel, CNBC Buffet reported that since March he had bought IBM shares totalling $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffet said that even IBM had known nothing about his participation until recently.
He commended management, which had managed to generate revenue even during the financial crisis.
"They did a great job," said Buffet, with a management strategy.
For a long time, IBM has focused on high-profit IT services such as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, also provides software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffet has been avoiding technology companies.
He claimed to invest only in companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in goods rail transport, the production of lubricant and engineering.
His holding of Berkshire Hathaway holds shares in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Münchener Ruck), along with some 80 of his own subsidiaries.
An 81-year-old bought a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built one of the world's most expensive companies with a good investment.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
made it a form of worship for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable money-making instinct gave him the nickname "Oracle of Omahia."
The IBM stock price rose by one percent before opening markets after Buffet's investment announcement.
The "Blue Giant," as IBM is also known, is on the stock exchange for over $220 billion, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
The Unfailing Danger
After the identification of the Tswickau cells, the Turkish media began to question the power of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers is talking about a blood ideology that's rising back to the surface.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and anxiety were a response to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long-forgotten fears, such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks have not occurred since the fires in Mellin in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
It had never been doubted, however, that xenophobic behaviour existed in Germany.
However, the current right-wing extremist network is of a scale that is not yet fully understood.
"Resurrection of bloody ideology?" was the title of the Internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant for the secret services, and is concerned that the German authorities may be dragged into the right-wing extremist moor.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded calmly, remembering the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish labour contract.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light as a success story.
Coverage in some Turkish media was like a slap. "German's 50th anniversary present" is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X," commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition of HURRIYET also did not miss the opportunity to draw this parallel.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of Ahmet Kulahji's column.
He notes that people have been killed who have paid taxes and contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany by their work.
The police conduct and subsequent successful raid were severely criticized on German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought before of following suspicious persons in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have reached a rather sharp rhetoric. "If they continue to act as awkwardly, they will have no choice but armed self-defense."
"It'll be the best self-defense."
"The world in Germany depends very much on how the whole network will be opened and on the validity of the sentence," writes Selen.
The crimes in Mellin and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat of peace in Germany.
The photograph of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply reflected in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
No other event has shown so clearly the Turks here that they are in danger, and the Germans that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of Turkish unity.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press at the time condemned mainly the failure of the German police following the attacks.
He sent a telegram of sympathy to the President of Turkey after the Zolingen arson, but his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Claus Kinkel-Kinkel, took part in the Cologne memorial ceremony in his speech and calculated the taxes that the Turks paid in Germany,
It's like he's defined the value of a person by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage of the Turkish media has shown again how the mistrust of many German Turks towards the present German state has grown ever since.
By clearly showing what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal on Lake Zurich
Most of Europe's top risky banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost bankrupt during the financial crisis and has since continuously struggled with one or the other crisis.
Now the German must return him to the right course.
Alex Webber probably didn't suspect he'd get this part.
In July, after his effective retirement as head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that he would take up an equally effective position in 2013 as chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; a sudden and lucrative career move.
Alex Weber was clearly excited, complimented Switzerland for its beauty, the UBS for its newfound strength, and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS managed to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grübel."
But it became clear in September that it would be quite different.
The UBS trader in London went through the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
Osvald Grübel, the president of UBS, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered ill, and everybody wants to know, when will Alex Webber finally take over?
Webber has been required to consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank announced on Tuesday, he'll be chairing the board in May instead of in 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Webber.
He's an economics professor and a Central Bank specialist, not a traditional banker, and he'll certainly need time to adapt.
He suddenly found himself responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved once again that he had long earned the title of the "greatest banking scandal in Europe."
UBS, on the one hand, is very big--until recently, it managed the world's largest asset--and on the other hand, years ago, it didn't come out of scandals.
A proud Swiss bank seems to spare nothing.
It all began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a beautiful reputation.
The bank combined the image of a secretive and sustainable but clever asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007 UBS managed $1.6 billion, thus having more money in the management of wealthy clients than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, he joined the league of the world's largest banks.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and a longtime professor at the University of Zurich Institute of Banking, explains: "I always gave my students UBS as a model of a good bank."
"Knowing what we know right now, you can ask me how I could have been so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was going on in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley -- who was considered an outstanding intellectual and, to the same extent, brilliant banker -- suddenly resigned from his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment branch of the bank tried to play on sub-standard security and had to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs in capital to counter the crisis.
The bank had indeed managed to find the investor -- but the investor whose services many bankers would have recently politely refused -- was one very opaque Asian sovereign foundation from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so hidden that even its name had not been announced.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, and the chairman of the Board of Directors, Marcel Osple, the second-largest chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, had resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, a disaster broke out, and due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS faced the threat of collapse, and the government had to save it.
The National Bank bought poisonous paper from UBS for unnamed billions, and the Swiss Confederate paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a binding conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked that the country realized the dramatic consequences of having huge banks in a small country.
After all, the total balance of UBS in 2007 was five times as high as the total production of Switzerland (see graph).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says banking analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in a tax dispute with the US and declared that it was willing to pass data to wealthy clients who might have been taxed by a bank.
UBS also agreed to pay 780 million dollars, consisting of compensation for unreasonable business income and fines.
UBS thus more or less recognized that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS lost what had always been his advantage in fighting for rich clients, a veil of secrecy.
After that scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors then resigned, and
The customer's money has begun.
Within a few months, the bank lost confidence in both its main areas of activity - investment due to poor speculation and asset management as a result of aid and the encouragement of tax evasion.
And it just calmed down, and it seemed like UBS had managed to break the situation, as it happened with this treacherous trader, and one single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank found something wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
"The incident with Adoboli made it clear that risk control had not changed enough," said Martin Jansen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks has no doubt, too, "The problem with UBS is that he doesn't have a risk control tool."
It is precisely caution that has long made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world's largest asset, not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether or not the world has collapsed outside the Alpine Republic.
Swiss bank safes have become a symbol of irresistible confidence, as Lindt and Sprangli symbolize fine taste in chocolate.
The UBS office in Zurich still fits the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, only it's a little larger.
Her location is a classic in itself.
The main office of the bank is located in Zurich, in Bangofstrace, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, surrounded by snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rent for shops is one of the highest in Europe.
Among traditional Swiss stores like Confiserie Springli, you can find such jewellery companies as Tiffany's here.
Swiss banks have been based here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Creedy Suisse Palace and elite private banks like Julius Beer.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls there are large leather couches, next to the bank's logo, a large sign of the Safe.
UBS knows what its clients need, trustworthiness.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point gave up the Swiss notions of banking--or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He would not like to see his name in the newspaper -- like all Swiss bankers; he also works with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large -- particularly in an investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his view, the Swiss had nothing to add here.
"And if there's something, then they've long adapted to Anglo-Saxon custom."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking that changed UBS, brought it the first big profit -- and then the fiasco -- that no other financial institution in Europe lost so much money in the jungle of sub-standards as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"In that environment, the ruler of a small country with a population of seven million people made the largest rescue operation in the history of the country," wrote Lucas Hessig in his book The UBS Crash.
The politicians approved the allocation of SwF 68 billion (about €45 billion) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to that?
If you ask Swiss banks, they'll say that the problem is mostly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank had been created, which at the time of the merging was too large for a small Switzerland, and a bank that had continued to grow.
And that's because the two banks that formed UBS were complementary, and one was a rich but powered bank that specialized in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
The internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money they could use to spin an almighty wheel.
Two names relate to the growth of UBS: Peter Woolffly, Executive Director of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Osple, President of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Ospello were a dream team," said Hans Geiger, a bank analyst.
"Wolfley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and profoundly understanding models and statistics, and Ospello, with his internal instinct, came all the way up, starting with an intern at the bank."
But Ospèle finally leaned on Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS officers remember well the meetings of board members at which Wolfley always repeated the same motto: to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was leading the "Tournary Table" where banks were making progress.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make a part of that way.
UBS was the largest player in currency trade and public security.
Authorized management counsellors, however, pointed to a weakness; in terms of what banking terminology calls “constant income,” UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failed in American mortgage products.
To shut the hole, UBS engaged in an adventure that almost cost him his life.
In pursuit of growth, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in US sub-standard security.
This has developed into a large mechanism that combines security based on American mortgages and sells them further -- keeping the risks on its own.
Even when other banks have long been searching for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought up to the summer of 2007, when the US real estate market was already on fire," says a banking analyst, Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager for the other had to leave as attempts to clean up the bank proved more difficult than originally seemed.
The UBS post has become a chair-playing children's game and remains unreliable until today.
Anyone who runs this huge bank is faced with an almost impossible task.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
The Geiger banking analyst already has the idea of abandoning investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not yet ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment must be significantly reduced.
The new head of the Bank, Sergei Hermotti, is planning to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually considered only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grübel.
Since then, he has been able to show character and, as the Zurich Bank said on Tuesday, he now leads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state in which it was in the mid-90s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These are probably questions Axel Weber asks himself.
Publicly he still said he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of a European recession are dragging down the US stock exchange
The coming European recession had eroded the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
Changing governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The collapse of industrial production on the continent has overwhelmed hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the bud.
The general relief that followed the changes of governments in Rome and Athens was not backed up.
The euro has fallen relative to the dollar.
Last week the Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half-full rather than half-empty--but now the problems are coming up again, said Mark Luskini of Janey Mongolia Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on sales lists.
The Dow Jones index closed at 12.078 with a fall of 0.6 per cent.

The Dax dropped by 1.2 percent at 5,985 points in Kraft.
The industry in the 17 countries of the euro zone has significantly reduced production and is adapting to the end of growth.
The statistical office of Eurostat reported that companies had produced two percent less in September than in the previous month.
"We're not on an island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe was unlikely to quickly shake the recession and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
In an interview with CNBC, he said that Europe was not strong enough to do whatever it takes to end the crisis.
He therefore considered it too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffet threw a decade-old principle into the trash and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His IBM investment of over ten billion dollars raised the trade price of this oldest company's shares by almost one percent against the trends.

Smart crows fill cities
Nowadays experts say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to be banished from cities.
Some like birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and the crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but the inhabitants complaining of dirt and noise are growing in many communities.
The problem of birds, however, is far from being solved.
At the first Crows Symposia in Lor, East Frisia, experts argued that it was no longer possible to banish the Grachey from the cities.
Professionals from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Conservativeists argued that the root of the problem in urban areas was the migration of particularly protected players, pointing out that the use of chemicals in the farming sector had increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
Hunting, growing construction and logging of traditional trees have made life more difficult for birds.
The crows are under protection.
There are large colonies in the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest in Yever, Dipholz, Achim under Bremen and Lera, with more than 600 parents.
A mixed project to shoot the crows out of Lera led to disapproving newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described catching birds in traps and beating them with sticks as particularly cruel.
"The usual movement and fright do nothing." said the architect and landscape designer Werner Klever of Lera.
Breaking nests with streams of water or cutting trees often has undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Keyser of Lara, Baden-Wurtenberg.
"Livables dissipate, and large colonies divide and extend to other areas."
Discretion is only possible in the form of exceptions near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We'll have to live with them, getting rid of them isn't an option."
In isolation from the surroundings, the urban problem will not be solved, says the mayor of Lera Wolfgang Kälner.
A combination of frightening birds from protected areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"The information stands instead of chainsaws" was a motto put forward by the therapist and ethnologist Utos, Mary Juergens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be sure of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information about the lives of very smart players.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jurgens also gave her opinion on complaints of noise made by birds. "The noise conveys a lot of information, they have a lot to say to each other."
The wits and wits of these birds have become legends; often they use not only their tools to take over the sighted piece, but they also make their own tools.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the measure of the avian mind on four grams.
In one experiment, birds quickly realized that they had to knock on the board to get the mold larvae.
Without much training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the tablet.
In another experiment, smart players had to solve a more difficult task.
The researchers put a little bucket with a mole larvae in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get hunt with a beak.
But researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and hooks to grab a bucket by a pen and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four have done it since the first attempt.
Rolando issues Portugal on Euro2012
The hopes of Bosniacs and Turks to win at the last minute were long overdue.
Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won their last seats in the Euro2012 championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the leadership of the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored for 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal won Bosnia and Herzegovina with a score of 6:2 (2:1) and perfected its fifth entry to the European Union after 0:0 in the first stage.
The Czechs had enough to be 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of playoffs against Montenegro's outsider after a clean win in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss its chance by playing 0:0 against Turkey, while Ireland easily scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Michael Velosa (80th) scored the rest for Portugal.
Former professional Boundseligi from Wolfsburg, Starran Misimowicz and Captain Emyr Spahich reduced the difference by two points due to a 41st minute effective penalty and a goal by 65th after Bosnia.
Sena Lulich got the second yellow card for the 54th minute.
Portugal has already beat Bosnia from the 2010 South Africa World Cup.
Portugal made a great start at the Lossbonese Estadio da Lus.
He took an early start with a free shot at the gate from about 30 meters.
The good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-distance capabilities by increasing the score to 2:0 from a 25-metre point.
The Bosnians, who had not opened the account in the first half an hour, had their first opportunity thanks to the attacking Edine Jaco.
Wolfsburg's former champion of the English championship, Manchester City, sent the ball his head down to the bottom of the trout for 33 minutes, but the ball did not cross the line of the gate.
Jirachek scores for the Czech Republic
Then the focus was on Judge Wolfgang Starck of Ergolding.
Following an attack on Elder Postig in the Bosnian penalty-base at 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was simulating and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also sentenced the doubtful penalty for playing the game with his hand after the foul of Fabio Cuentran-Missimowicz realized it.
After the break of Europe's 2004 Vice-Champions, the score was fixed with four more goals.
Peter Jirachek dissipated all remaining doubts about the Czechs for the 81st minute.
The champions of Europe in the 1970s are sent for the fifth consecutive European championship.
The team of coaches, Michael Bielec, and the Legionaries of the Boundsleys, Michael Leverkuzen, and Thomas Pechart (1st FC Nuremberg) also smiled after an error at the very beginning that could have become a disaster.
The porter Peter Chech for the 9th minute, thanks to the instant reflex, prevented the potential tomash Siwok's autogole.
Montenegrin's best chances were when there was a duo of Stevan Jovetich and Dejan Damianowicz.
Damianovic struck from the edge of the penalty pond for the 40th minute and nearly scored a goal for the Czech.
After a break, the stocking saved the already-broken Czech world-class Hollywood after the forward FC Seoul left the field for 50 minutes.
The winning goal was hit just before the final whistle.
Meanwhile, Turkey did not have enough football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks couldn't play better than the 0:0 in Zagreb.
While there is now almost no doubt that Gus Hiddink's coach will now vacate a seat on the bench of the team that came to third place in 2002, the Croatians are the fourth time in the European Final Tour.
The Turks were almost able to launch the perfect 31,000 viewers at Maximemir Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's long-distance strike for the seventh minute hit the bar, and the attacker, Kasim Qasim, failed to beat the ball into the net.
Croatia then woke up and began to take control of the game.
After the break, the Croatians continued the game in excellent shape.
The Legionaries of Boundselig Daniel Pranic (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintraut, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukic of the Wolfsburg team, who gave up Ivan Perishic of Dortmund for the sixty-second minute.
Trapattoni is on his way to Euro2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first European trip after Germany in 1988.
The team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni -- who already looked confident in her place after winning 4:0 in the first stage -- took the leadership for the 32nd minute thanks to Stephen Ward's voice.
Constantine Vasiliev of the guest team compared the score for the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the beginning, but only at the 23rd minute did robbie Keen of Los Angeles make the first clean bare blow.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from leading Ireland forward.
The goal was full for the 32nd minute.
Bypassing the protection of the Hollywood player Paul Londack, Ward found himself in the right place and, by throwing the ball across the line, changed the score by 1:0.

Massacres - human dimension
Peter Englund's strained and very kind new book "The Beauty and Pray: The Personal History of the First World War" begins with a long list of actors from whom the heart dies.
Here's a tip: cut this page carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very closely as Mr. Englund speaks, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon at those moments when, like one of these men and women, you get off the road and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which is the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as "work on anti-history."
There are few known names, important compacts or famous battles; there are hardly any ambassadors, clever journalists, or discussions about tactics and military technology.
It's not so much a book about what happened,--it's not so much a book about what it was like, it's about feelings, experiences, feelings, and the state of the spirit.
The book "Beautifulness and Pilgrimage" combined the experience of 20 more or less invisible men and women from both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, emergency drivers and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone's going to get captured, lose a hand or a leg, go crazy or die.
Their lives are blinking here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are fading at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is also an adjustment to the notion that the First World War was only a grave war on the West Front.
Beauty and Pray provides a skillful panorama of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Atlantic, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are hit by bees' hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is the tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War engulfs these people as a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, who smells of smokeless powder.
When you're a woman and you're at home with the kids, will you stay there or run away?
Anyway, who's going on?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," remarked Mr. Englund, "is filled with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiratories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
Beauty and Pray traces the fate of people like Florence Farmoro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young mariner of the German High Seas Navy.
Their stories come mainly from memoirs, letters and other published materials.
The stories of their lives may be frightening or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to Mr. Englund's small moments and piecemeal details.
Many of them are about suffering and how to cope with them.
When he tells the history of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, everywhere is an erzac."
"Replacer, forged aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He keeps talking about the eszac food in Germany.
He describes "the meat of pressed rice, boiled in lamb fat (and decorated with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; footwear cut by a tree".
He notes that there were “837 registered substitutes for meat allowed in the production of sausage, 511 registered substitutes for coffee”.
Some stories speak of honour and courage.
One American remarks in his very passion for violence and says, "You feel that, after all, that's what men were designed for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whisky, evening paper or bestseller, and to say that this show is civilization and that under your pretty shirt with sticks there's no barbarian."
On the contrary, the British soldier notes that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
"When a person accepts the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think it would happen in front of the public," he writes.
But it's the other way around, it's like a "convicted man who's hung up secretly."
Other comments relate to old Europe, which is falling apart, and to new types of fear.
"The conflict has become more and more an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "the war of factories."
He marks the coming of someone called "a new species in the bestiary of the beginning century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-mixed suit that organizes a carnage sitting at the writing table."
People act unexpectedly: low-level actions are just as heroic.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who had tried at all times to catch a venereal disease from the hookers in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The greatest expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhoeal which soldiers bought and smeared in their genetics in hopes of entering the hospital," he writes.
"Every desperate one shook his eyes, which often led to life's blindness."
Translated with Mr. Englund's Swedish Peter Graves Proza is flexibly but non-negative, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how the war "freed completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders make them fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fassel or novels such as "On the West Front Without Change" by Erich-Marie Remark rather than by complete historical writings.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unshaped pantheon.
His book has the most amazing finale I can remember in unlucky literature.
I'm not going to tell him.
But it's like he reached out to a page with a list of characters, grabbed it out of your hands and set fire to a match.
After the previous error, a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some wearing protective hats.
The night watch from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zucotti Park was supposed to have the least people at that time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-level officers, and the others were first told that they were going to the exercises.
The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, was at the centre of the events, and his presence highlighted the importance the police department attached to the operation.
There could be no mention of repeating such episodes of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which contradicted the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupier.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to release the Zukotti Park protesters.
The authorities were preparing to observe the expansion of occupation in other cities.
The largest crisis exercises were carried out on the island of Randells, counting on Zucotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot exercises -- counter-terrorism measures that provide for the rapid movement of a large number of police officers -- with reference to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute," told a source familiar with orders in which the job was referred only to as "training."
"The few cops I know who have been called up for this case haven't been told they're being sent to Zucotti Park," said this man, who spoke anonymously.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zucotti Park were at the highest levels in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated to hundreds of protesters who rushed inside before the scheduled date, hearing about these plans.
On Tuesday, various police units, including district forces, were involved in the operation, which were commonly used to control criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like to work, come and leave the park during the day, which makes 1 o'clock in the morning a suitable time for an offensive.
"It was right to do it when the park had the least people," he said.
The rescue cars, with spotlights and loudspeakers, gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin FDR, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The spotlight and prerecorded advertisements coming from loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue windmills, many protesters simply packed their things and left.
The police reported that the tents had not been moved until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters time to pick up their things.
Other police groups, according to witnesses, had gathered around the perimeter to enter if arrest was required in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, the head of the police department, said it was for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see the police and that police officers treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could take pictures.
When the police went west through a pile of personal objects of protesters, including bags, plastic mats and plastic bags, full of clothes, teams of the Medical Department followed her, collecting what had been abandoned.
Some protesters who refused to leave were pulled out, photos of this soon appeared on the Internet.
The main protest team took a position near the kitchen of the camp, at the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp chained themselves together by their hands.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The rescue services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clean-up operation was completed about 75 minutes later, reported by the police.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
The majority were arrested for "infringing public order and resisting arrest," he said.
The highest officer on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, the head of the department's detective police, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, though present, "not led the operation," said Mr. Brown.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberia Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to get inside.
The fences were placed in Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a quarter south.
Observers saw the police extend the perimeter from these positions even beyond the Zukotti Park border.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, push people farther away.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to witnesses, released air from the buses of a police van.
At some point a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The school service union will sue the city for dismissal
The union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminating because of the disproportionate influence on schools where poor students are enrolled.
The trial is probably the last means available to the county council's trade union 37, attempting to terminate the dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, a contact point for parents and other employees who were among the lowest paid workers in the city, lost their jobs on 7 October as a result of the fact that trade union leaders called a political reaction to their failure to give the city access to health funds managed by labour groups to close the budget last spring.
City officials categorically rejected this charge.
At the City Council hearing last month, the chancellor of the schools, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the board members was arguing that there was no indication anywhere in the budget that school assistants would be dismissed.
Members of the 37 District Council reported that they had filed a notice of claim by notifying the Department of Education that a complaint had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce the formal filing of a complaint before the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The suit will identify Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department as defendants and list eight temporarily dismissed employees as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, as well as most assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's law department, said that the city had not seen the suit and therefore could not comment on its particular situation.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint in the New York Times, the union focused on a number of lay-offs in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, arguing that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were few lay-offs in Staten Island, and there were few in Upper East Side or Trybeki schools, 17 school assistants lost their seats in Area 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Brinks.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at a free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the claim states: “This is not the region of wealthy parents who can find money to fill the budget failure.”
P.S. The 36th budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way of counting extra funding for every poor student who went to school.
The union also asserts that the principals of schools may have been misled by the language of notification allowing the dismissal of the parents' contact points.
The notification used the word “exceeding”, although “excession” is more commonly referred to when the teacher from the school's paycard is moved to the list of available employees whose wages are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents' contact points were dismissed," says the draft complaint, "not just translated."
The mission is over, the Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya.
It seems that the Republicans and the Democratics on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the Libyan uprising.
All it took was for the mutiny to succeed, the long-standing dictator Muammar Qaddafi was taken prisoner and killed, and American interference ended.
On Tuesday, the Sentence's Foreign Relations Committee is to consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (democracy, Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (Independent, Connecticut), who commend the Libyans for their successful uprising and American troops for their "fidelity".
"The purpose of this resolution is to honour the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"This is confirmation of the support of both parties for their democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but none of the discussions on Libya have been easy.
This summer lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and with the White House about the wording of a series of resolutions that endorse or condemn the role of the United States army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution allowing for the limited use of United States military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority vote of both parties and was never put to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill collapsed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would reduce the financing of the US operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in some sort of law-making purge -- when the Congress is annoyed enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not angry enough to actually rip the ground out of its feet.
Then events overcame the indiscretion of the Congress.
In August Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels and on 20 October Kaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “revealed by the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and perseverance in their quest for freedom” and thanked the men and women of the United States armed forces and their collaborators who had participated in the military operation to defend the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionality.
The resolution also “certifies the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Would the new measures receive full support from the foreign affairs board or would the lawmakers be divided like the June bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee, objected to the latter.
Luger's representative said on Monday that he had not yet seen the last version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives should vote this week for a constitutional revision that requires a balanced budget, a primary legislative priority for almost every republican and some democrats in the Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional revision of the budget or of anything else to be submitted to the plenary vote of the Congress of this convocation.
Other lawmakers had not yet been able to make their corrections to the plenary, but not because they had not tried.
The Gudlat amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional changes that affect a wide range of issues that have been introduced in this process.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 revisions to the balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and more to “control over federal expenses”.
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors -- mostly newly elected Republicans who wish to decorate their resumes -- an opportunity to brag that they have "pronounced" such a sentence.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of a balanced budget adjustment.
In March, fifty-eight senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some Congressmen wanted to limit the number of terms of office of members of the Congress, while a member of the House of Representatives, Jose Serrano (democracy, New York), wanted to abolish the two-year limit for the President.
Congressman Jessie L. Jackson, Jr. (democracy, Illinois) has proposed many changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An adjustment that bans same-sex marriage has been offered for many years, as has another one that prevents flag burning.
Some lawmakers also wish to allow the revocation of federal laws if two thirds of the states object to them.
As members of the Congress have sought to propose changes, they have progressed no faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, 77 such changes were proposed by the lawmakers, while 66 were introduced in the 110th Congress.
This rate will be pale compared to the early 1990s, when members of the Congress, according to the Library of the Senate, regularly submitted more than 150 revisions every two years.
But they've been as successful as they are now.
The last revision, the 27th, was approved in 1992 but was actually submitted to the Congress in 1789.
"Betrayed but not defeated," says Giffords in his first television interview after the attempt
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives, Gabriel Giffords (democratic party, Arizona), appeared on Monday night on the Federal Channel, sang a song from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Return Tomorrow" and said she wanted to be better than to be back in the Congres.
After appearing on the 2020 ABC News program with Diana Sawyer, Giffords struggled to make suggestions and needed help walking.
The program showed her a difficult path of recovery from a bullet wound that broke her skull and shattered the left side of her brain, passing from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later she had suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and had triumphantly voted on the bill on the maximum debt.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 wounded, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang -- and called her recovery "hard."
When Sawyer asked how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
An interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special hourly issue of "2020", which was shown on the eve of a new book by the couple, "Gabby: History of courage and hope".
The special episode spoke of the restoration of Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
In videos taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to do simple things.
Nod your head.
Stretch your lips.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later Giffords spoke the second word, "toast," asking for a change in the breakfast menu.
The video shown by ABC shows that music has played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: we see the Congressman singing along with the girls just want to have fun with Cyndi Loper and Tom Petty's free fall.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on the procedure, she said she didn't remember the day of the murder.
Her husband said that he had read an article in the newspaper about the 12 March shooting when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had been killed at the time.
The suspected assailant Jerd Lee Lafner is being held in Missouri prison and is being subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"It's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not defeated," said Kelly.
You're just beaten.
And you'll get through this, you'll get better and you'll come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a holiday on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless survivors in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
On signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines built around it.
The audience in the tuxedo applauded him standing up.
"The soldiers were looked at as heroes," said David Salzman, who organized the spring collection of money.
The senior military officer at the concert, who also had the then chairman of the Chiefs of Staff, admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," wrote the officer in an email.
I'm sure the organisers wanted to do the right thing.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
Quite contrary impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have emerged between the military and the often indifferent, sometimes admired, American audience.
The military is overwhelmed with commendations for their sacrifices.
But commendation has a price, say the military.
The public behaves more and more as if they feel pity for people in uniform.
"We're not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who was in charge of the military in Iraq and was soon leaving for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us like unhappy people."
It's a sensitive theme for warlords who don't want to look unthankful or disagreeable with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by returning troops in recent years of war in Viet Nam was much worse.
As a result, most of the conversations about compassion take place quietly and between war-veterans only.
After two of his sons had returned from fighting in the Marines, the retired Colonel Mark Kenshn warned them that non-armies would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration, for they have overwhelmed the rebels and have been in exotic places.
Others would wonder whether there was "under the mask of a cruel, angry warlord," said Kenshn, who had fought in Iraq and had returned to a high government post in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he said he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he would be able to cope with the strain of responsible work in Washington immediately after the fighting.
Kenshn remembers saying to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to rely on a negative effect."
The inconvenience experienced by the military is partly due to American indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield is seldom appreciated by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was generally in the Second World War," says the retired lieutenant-general David Barnow, who was commanding American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mainly focused on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
The soldiers are counted by the number of marches they have made, by the number of companions they have lost, or by the scale of the loss.
The army faces growing pressure from anti-rape advocates
This week, the historic court hearing should decide whether 28 men and women will be sued against the army for non-resistance of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be queued for the next one.
Private first grade Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and she allegedly raped at night by a fellow worker.
It was in October 2008, she was returning to her barn at Miramar airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend, and she met a male fellow carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But the native of Texas has lost her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I hadn't listened to my instinct."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, a man came up to her from behind, fell and raped, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other present and former soldiers will be eagerly awaiting the trial at a historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether or not the action they have brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rusmfeld, will proceed.
The claim claims that Gates and Rumsfeld were unable to cope with widespread military violence in violation of the military's constitutional rights.
The suit, filed in February by counsel for Susan Berk from Washington, D.C., originally included 17 plaintiffs, but rose to 28 in the following months, to 25 women and three men, who all claim to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by fellow officers and that the army has failed to properly investigate, prosecute or ensure proper justice after the alleged attacks.
Burk says she's targeted at the top of the army because the problem starts with them.
"Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are those people who can exterminate the cult of violence?
Burk also says that since February some 400 other victims have contacted her, many of whom may be involved in future claims.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case -- put all the eggs in one basket, so to speak -- she'll open up a lot of stuff if necessary to keep the pressure up.
A defence team from the Ministry of Defence, led by the Federal prosecutor Neil McBride, took steps to discontinue the case.
The court documents that Newsweek received reveal a protection strategy, mainly that former or present soldiers cannot claim the army for damage to the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision by Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not liable for damage caused by persons in military service.
"The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs," states the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially barred from participating in combat, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear frontline.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
The result: Between the two wars, 150 women soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the army to become modern, Burk says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her suit, three others are prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Service is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a feminist atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of the American War Veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a suit against an army that is centred on the diagnosis of the “modification” of the victims of violence in order to suspend them from their service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the human rights group, of the Organization for the Action of Women Servants.
Her group filed a suit against the Veterans' Office in December, accusing him of discriminating with regard to applications for pensions from people who claim to have been at risk of sexual violence during their service.
Nine separate bills containing a number of measures were submitted to the Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry ' s Service for the Prevention and Control of Sexual Violents, 3,158 attempted rapes were reported.
But it is known that attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates this figure is about 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examined the percentage of court cases: 20 per cent of reported cases reached trial in 2010 - half as low as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burk case call attacks on them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported being raped by the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times to the police, doctors and officers.
She collected evidence of the rape, and the victim's blood, from a cut on her arm, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend before the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive character to the accused, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," said Lyman.
"I thought I was about to have a baby--I ran out of court with a scream."
"They put me in the psych ward, and when I got out, I remember my commanding officer saying, "It wasn't a trial of him, it was a trial of me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military shrink who eventually diagnosed her identity change, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with a negative expression, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether or not Lyman's case and her suit pals will move forward is a difficult matter, says John Terley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he says, "I think they're in a position to move forward."
There is a doctrine between them and the verdict that has been criticized since it emerged.
I've been criticizing Doctrin Feres my whole life.
The army had fallen behind for decades because it did not have the kind of incentive and constraint that puts responsibility on it.
He adds, "The chance is very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favour, Burk, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this matter until there is reform," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremists in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was just a guy who spoke out his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Breiwick, who had confessed to having committed a murder in Norway in July, which had claimed the lives of 77 people, appeared at his first public trial.
Although Braywick could act alone, he was far from alone in the network: he spent a long time preparing to attack behind his computer, interacting with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups in social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy, you just have to go to Facebook.
"We've realized that it's not hard to get close to them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European cyber populism at the British DEMOS Research Center.
Facebook personal data is so large, says Bartlett that researchers could easily use the site's advertising tool to highlight the necessary population group with scientific precision -- what marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans all over Europe and then gave them advertisements, but instead of showing a new group or a diet product, the advertisement offered the user a survey that included questions about the level of their education, the attitude to violence and the optimism about their own future.
With Facebook's help, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 members of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries, without even leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to do research," said Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so amazing: right-wing online players are mostly young men who are dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind the monitor."
DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a popular new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and polytologists use the site to study everything in the world, from health issues to social trends expressed in Lycas, wall posts and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three entries a day, Facebook's "super-actual information" has caused a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the title of the site by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it provides an opportunity to study people who cannot be reached on the street with a notebook.
"Before, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have had to join the party, and they would never have accepted you," said Bartlett.
"Facebook cancels all this -- you address them directly."
Others say that this site could identify and explore social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Meghan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunken Facebook performances were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that peers, such as their hostel teachers, can monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drinking status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," reported Washington Post Dimitry Christakis, co-author of Moreno and Director of the Centre for Child Health, Behaviour and Development at the Children's Institute of Science and Research in Seattle.
"We've found a way to identify children from a risk group that we wouldn't have found otherwise."
Facebook also regularly extracts various types of data about its users.
The site's data processing team processed the status statistics and Valentine's Day statistics, the mid-term turnout of voters in 2010 and the National happiness index (mainly using information available only to them - the champions of cyber freedom have long insisted that the site should make its extensive data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they like it or not -- in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict standards for offline research, online data is publicly available.
"I don't think many users have at least thought that a researcher can monitor their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, and he did a study in 2006 using public Facebook pages.
"As far as they thought it was between them and their friends."
This raises the question of the method.
Even offline there's no guarantee that the subject of the study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to find out how much information in the profile and on the user page is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," said Selvin.
That's why, despite his years of work in technology research, Selwin thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools to be used.
"Nothing can replace going to the real world and communicating with real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social research, and most social research is still offline."
"Cold and inhumane": Anders Bering Bravik will be tried for the first time in public
Anders Bering Bravik, a man who confessed to having organized a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a resistance fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights of the Templers of Norway," he said to the 500 present in the court.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess my actions, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torquiel Nesheim interrupted Braywick during this monologue because he "not wanted to let Braywick use this hearing as a platform to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravik, who had brought a written speech with him, to contact the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Braywick in custody for another 12 weeks, denied him access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Bravik in the eye; others--to make sure that he is kept locked.
Everyone came to find the answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said NRK to the Norwegian channel, one of the survivors of Utoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally I felt a little better after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breiwick remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite the strange idea of Bravik that he was part of a large resistance movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy, and said that there was no evidence that he was dealing with accomplices.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the 22 July attacks seem to be the work of one extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But it doesn't automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation is experiencing.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but it's not," said a relative of one victim.
"It would be much easier if it were."
Seven lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, which is shown in the theatre this week.
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing a technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can think of as the greatest discovery in the recently discovered interview, which was remembered in anticipation of the pre-shows at the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a careful organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders had suffered from "the pain of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] the great idea of a great product separates a great amount of skill."
Let's go back to 1995, Bob Kringley was creating a TV series called the Nerde Triumph on the arrival of a personal computer, and he spent over an hour with Jobs for a uniquely long conversation.
By that time, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was banished from Apple, and he was already fully employed by his new NeXT computer company in anticipation of the massive development of the Internet.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in the Nards, he says that the original interviews were missing during transport.
Only after Jobs' death was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This film, which was somewhat edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film, Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which is published on Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hate for detailed interviews, Jobs seems here unusually prepared to express his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different moments during the interview, there's a great deal of time between questions and answers -- reflections for 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments where Jobs' perfection comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by Kringley's questions, which make him move quickly to issues or events of greater importance.
In the pre-Picsar era, iPods and iPhones of Lost interviews, there is something ominous prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about Jobs' postmortem performance, but there's something sensitive and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, a troubled dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A little summary of the seven significant findings of the Lost interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
And the answers you always get are, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, nobody thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I learned.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to improve reporting in Apple.
By way of recording costs, often starting with "standard costs," which were collected from the ceiling and then followed up with "unclearance," he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to track business costs up to the slightest.
About the pope's joke:
Jobs details the "Blue Box" he made with Steve Wozniak, a device that enabled people to effectively hack the phone company and call at long distances free of charge.
There was a lot of writing about the device before, but Jobs' euphoria is here describing the blue box as an act of power being contagious.
He talks about how he and Wozniak tested the box using a telephone machine, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the globe half a dozen times, and you've yelled at the telephone machine, and it's infiltrated the next few minutes later," says Jobs smilingly.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both knew a little bit, but we could build a little thing that could control a big thing-- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, Apple could ever appear.
Jobs continues to describe in detail a famous incident that he and Wozniak almost managed by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope to telephone, trying hard to copy Henry Kissinger.
When different members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomatic, these two began laughing just before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and the cold name of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 he was hunting for the spare parts of the frequentometer, and he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett Packard.
"It had a strong influence on me, it was the only company I had ever seen at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP officers who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw the "first desktop computer".
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a small monitor with an electronic ray tube, and I fell in love with it.
I used to drive to HP as a teenager and roll around that car and write programs for it.
On improvised innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about the invention of new products for the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of installments, one customer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to consider both assembly and delivery of ready-made devices.
Later in Apple, he remembered the difficulties he had encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the violent arguments they were shouting at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], and I was fed up, and I came out, and I found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could raise for 15 dollars, which was incredibly reliable.
About large companies losing energy:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs had precisely anticipated how many industry leaders would be wrong in seeing the situation and lose control over their market share.
"Let's say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company's not getting any more successful.
Selling and marketing make it more successful, so [these types of people] who eventually get to run companies, and people making products get pushed off the decision-making board.
The genius of the product that led to this monopoly is replaced by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products -- the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could have been ten times larger, could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They were defeated by victory.
On innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea of a great product separates a great amount of skill ... when you twist a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her finesse.
There are compromises that you need to make -- some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts -- connecting them all together...
After all, it's all about taste -- it's about trying to express itself in the best things people have ever done, and then trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made MacIntosh famous was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had happened to be the best information technology experts in the world.
If it wasn't for information technology, they'd do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having dinner with the opponents of the health care law while the court is considering the case.
On the day the Supreme Court was meeting behind closed doors to discuss the political issue of whether he would listen to President Obama's health bill, his two judges, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas, bequeathed at a dinner sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the matter before the High Court.
This case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions submitted.
One of the cases on the agenda was a motion supported by 26 states, challenging the rapid revision of health adopted by the Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists from all over the nation.
The judges had agreed to consider the process; indeed, a 5 1/2-hour turning-point debate was expected in March 2012 and the outcome was likely to interfere with the Presidential race, which would be in the midst of the announcement of the judgement.
The lawyer who will stand trial and argue that the health law should be revoked will probably be Paul Clement, who was the deputy prosecutor-general during George W. Bush's presidency.
Clement's law firm Bancroft PLLC was one of almost two dozen companies that helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Fed, a long-standing group that constantly defends the conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored dinner represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Independent Business Federation.
Another sponsor was Pflizer Inc, a drug giant, who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
There was, among other things, a leader of the Republicans in the senate and a well-known opponent of the health law.
Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been attending events of the Fed for years.
And that is not at all contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct which governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they obeyed, they might fall within the scope of principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judge may attend the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour or be mentioned in the programme of such an event”.
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal to the ethics activists in the government.
"It is a staggering breach of ethics and indifference to the code contrary to the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Court.
"The judges had been drinking and having dinner at an official fund-raiser with lawyers who are currently in court."
Their emergence and assistance in collecting money for this event undermines all claims of apathy and is not accepted.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say they're very willing to mix court cases with cases of groups like the Fed.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a famous conservator activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives claim that this raises an ethical issue with regard to Judge Helena Kagan rather than Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the court of first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be fair now.
Cogan didn't show that she was going to do that.
Boeing gets a record 18 billion plane orders.
Emirates is ordering 50 wide-body Boeing 777 and may be ordering another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal is over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its product.
But this is an important event where this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft developer, and the price for all these 50 planes is 18 billion dollars.
Just as important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing gold mine of future plane orders.
In a Monday forecast, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend his biggest dollar-equivalent commercial flight order, 50 two-way Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The company also has an opportunity to buy 20 more planes, which will raise the total price to 26 billion dollars, and Boeing announced on the Dubai airshow 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Omen Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which could show a much better economy of fuel and passenger convenience.
The price of six planes will be over $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neil Dior.
"The quality of these particular customers is rather high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Hence, not only do they have the money to pay for planes, but they also have higher fuel prices, which usually damage air companies, as this is one of the largest items of expenditure, not only because the country earns money at high oil prices.
That's important, because they're less likely than other air companies to cancel the plane order when the prices rise, said Dior.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the broad-flying aircraft market and helps prevent a rival Airbus SAS from encroaching on it with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing won the air show four months after Airbus announced that he would defer the debut of the biggest A350, who was competing with 777-300ER.
He postponed his debut to increase the axe load after the customers demanded an increase in the volume and range of the flight.
Boeing Co stock grew by 1.5 percent to $6.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico evidently lost in the elections in Mexico City.
Louisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers were helping a fox opponent from the IRI in the run.
President Felipe Calderon's sister did not seem to have implemented her application for governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she announced on Monday that drug dealers had helped to drive the race in favour of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results indicate that the leader of the West state governor race is called Fusto Vallejo of the Revolutionary-Instructural Party, or the IRI.
"The interference of organized crime during the entire election process, and especially yesterday, is disturbing not only for Michoacán, but also for the entire country," said Louisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after the Sunday vote.
"They bullied our candidates, our employees at the election... they grabbed the boxes for the vote, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IRI.
The IRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She prepares for return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in this attempt.
The IRI hopes to win the July Presidential elections.
Vallejo seems to have just overtaken Calderon, who led the ratings until election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or a PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Sylvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DPP, which now owns the governor's chair, came third, a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 Presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to accept the initial results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied contact with drug dealers and called on other candidates to accept the results.
In Michoacán, drug cartels, specializing in marijuana, heroes and methamphetamines, have long dominated the world.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug-dealers in December 2006.
The violence continues.
The MRI mayor was killed a week before the election when he was agitating for Louisa Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local election race for fear.
For the IRI, however terrible the elections in Michoakana may look, victory will give the party a dynamic impulse.
The man who should represent the IRI in the president's race, Henrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very inspiring in the front door of next year."
ADB persuades Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank had obliged India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term slowdown that would halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the manager of the ADB office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing large economies must “do their utmost” to accelerate the reconstruction of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct bilateral arrangements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties “impartially” and said that Asian financial cooperation, side by side with European leadership and resources, could help avoid a long-term slowdown in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he reported to the Financial Times during an interview at the Mumbai World Economic Forum.
"Asia may be somewhat protected, but it cannot be invincible."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European monetary union has been severely affected by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's debt has grown dangerously, and both the Italian and Greek Prime Ministers have resigned.
The European debt crisis has created fears that it can lead the world economy back to a recession, and has led to calls by leading developing economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg had predicted that any Asian assistance would be provided through the IMF, but he said that two-way cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial assistance bonds, the means to secure financial stability in Europe -- was a powerful negotiation tool for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Charma, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do its best to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in export and foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and troubled," he said.
"We have enormous challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a requirement, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our young people."
Others argue that it makes no sense for developing economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Astouche Warshny, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult politically to provide assistance to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, of whom about 800 million live on 2 dollars a day or less.
"At some point they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go on holidays to the sea, and it won't be taken well," he said.
Lee Howell, the Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector employees working in badly organized, lost businesses such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis threatened “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
ADB's forecast of a 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2012 - 2012 is now faced with “promising risks” due to a threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to come up with “emergency plans” to protect themselves from the decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
The Pentagon ' s fearful warnings of potential defence cost cuts
The Defence Minister, Leon Panetta, set the stage on Monday at the Congress, warning that expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already accustomed to a $450 billion reduction in the coming decade, but is now afraid that an additional $600 billion or more reduction may be inevitable if a convention fails to reach a cost agreement.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating to the Ministry," said Panetta in a letter to Senator John McCain, Arizona, and to the Republican Lyndsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the Congress's failure to accept a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestre would initiate a general reduction of 23% and terminate many new projects.
"So much reduction, so thoughtlessly applied, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building -- and will seriously damage other attempts to upgrade," wrote Panetta to the Senators.
"We will also have to fire many of our civil servants and, since the reduction will take place so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the civils to achieve the goal."
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and seriously damage our readiness."
The abbreviations will eventually affect the military, said Panetta.
"Although military financing in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequestre, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious breakdown in the core budget," warned Panetta.
“Contracted staff will be reduced, which will result in the termination of the contract and the oversight contract that supports the troops.”
"Settlements will be reduced, resulting in late payments to military vendors, and legal and political support will be compromised."
Two senators wrote to the Panetta 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
"The effect of the sequestration in the Department of Defence will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand firm against this draconian action," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday night when they released the Panetta letter.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we have to push ourselves."
"The secret is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen."
Whether the Panetta's letter or the Senators' recent warnings will lead to a budget compromise or increase calls for the Pentagon's release from cuts, we'll see later.
The Panetta was completely honest about possible cuts, although he came to work at the Pentagon's management after years of budget analysis at the Congress and the White House, and was aware that he was faced with a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a gloomy picture of what might follow -- troops with a shell but no kernel.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"This is a squad without bullets."
"It's a wing plane without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," said Panetta in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from an insecure combat spirit, a bad readiness and is unable to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In an attachment to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he provided new details on how cuts “create significant operational risks: slow responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously limit our ability to be the first to launch and respond anywhere in the world; and lead to an unacceptable risk in future combat operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects might encounter obstacles, including those that have already been tested, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 striker, a planned new-generation bomber, a new-generation nuclear submarine, a new battleship of the coast zone and a new ground-based combat vehicle which the army and the Marines need to replace with a hummer.
Ending further F35 development and testing may save 80 billion dollars in 10 years, but its advocates say that this is a vital next step to improve and counter the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Catch on a Liar
A quick look at recent headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
A Republican candidate, Herman Kane, is engaged in challenging charges of sexual harassment by several women; each party accused the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania administration was charged with perjury because they allegedly concealed that a retired football coach had raped the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on a microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying ruins careers and shakes countries.
New York's Congressman and internet-exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself, denying his actions, which were quickly denied by uncontested evidence.
Former President John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to conceal extra-marriage relationships.
Again, none of those who lived at that time would ever forget the media concert with President Bill Clinton, who had been found lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
The stories of high school and college exam fraud are commonplace.
There were times when teachers gave the students answers to the tests in order to have a good evaluation of their performance.
Teachers who have to teach the contrary send a message that lies and fraud are accepted.
How many lies do we face?
In one day, studies show that you can lie between 10 and 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to save.
Another study showed that strangers had lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Identifying a lie or holding a lie is a requirement for everyone's skills for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, which looks like, say, the charades where you need to exclaim "From!", the discovery of lies is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in extensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most old myths about lies have been dispelled.
Liars look into their eyes.
They don't always stop, stutter, blush, or fuss.
We should not conclude that liars are hard to spot and hard to expose.
An experienced debugger can get to the truth by observing the structure of the claims, the mimics, the structure of the issues and the temporary characteristics.
I have spent a few years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing section of the knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the detection of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps guide in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include rendition, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are perfectly capable of reading others, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively the way others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried ones (but the lies they say are often obstinate).
We also know that if you are perceived as a deceiver, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do you know if anybody's lying?
First, observe the normal behaviour of your object.
It's called the definition of the source state.
This helps to provide a starting point for measuring changes further.
Watch the posture, the laughter, the voice properties of your object.
It's good to know if a person knocks his feet regularly in normal condition, then you won't charge me unjustly when you see his feet knocking in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of deceitful verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Treat these groups as red flags rather than proof of cheating.
Falsemen can fix the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet in the direction of the door, lean towards the exit, change their position in a certain way, or show "frequency after the interview" -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position when all the difficult issues are over.
Investigators often falsify the end of the questioning to just look at the relief after the interview.
So, look at the speech of your object.
Scott Peterson is known to have stumbled and used the past time, arguing that his murdered wife was alive, leading to a search throughout the country.
Attractive people can also use distance in speech: "I haven't had sex with this woman... Miss Levinski" or repeat the complex question completely.
The most common verbal indicator is scarcely graspable.
Someone can use a "characterized language" when they answer the difficult question, "All right ... truth be told ... as far as I know ... as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than de facto, and is often a red flag.
There's no magical way to detect a lie, but you can learn how to detect a fraud.
These skills will increase everyone's chances of not being victimized by skilled cheaters in their professional and personal lives.
The disputed oil pipeline plan needs to be re-examined after the US threat to defer its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- causing union anger, but calming the environmental advocates -- the company going to build the oil pipeline claims that it will willingly re-examine the project in order to resume work on it.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it would remove the planned oil pipeline from the ecologically sensitive sandy hills in Nebraska and that the project would still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska State Capitol.
The official representative of TransCanada, Alex Purbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually get approval for the oil pipeline, though with a different route.
This comes after a statement by the State Department last week that it will defer a decision on a project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills and Ogala Aquifer, a huge underground water reserve.
"This is a real step forward," said Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental evaluation ordered by the State Department is likely to defer the decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, although the authorities denied that the decision was a political one.
Obama, in a written statement last week, called the Department of State for it and expressed his support for it.
An oil pipeline of 1,700 miles is expected to extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to the Texas oil industry.
To do that, he needs to cross six states.
He's hated by environmentalists, but he likes trade unionists who hope for about 20,000 jobs connected with the oil pipeline.
But Nebraska's opponents are considering a bill to speed up the movement from Sand Hills and Ogallala's aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department study on environmental impacts showed that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source in the energy industry stated that the Department's auditor had ordered a separate examination of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist employed by Trans Canada, Paul Eliott, who was a consultant to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other was whether the choice of a firm that was hired to conduct an initial study was not appropriate because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBell was sued for allegedly making the child sick out of fear.
The New York family claims that Patti LaBell's disco-debbie began raging in their Manhattan lobby, scaring their young daughter to the point that she was sick out of fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" tyrade frightened 18 months old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personal change, sleep disorder" and "the great fear of strangers," says her family in the Manhattan High Court.
This happened on November 10, last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, the nursery teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell reprimanded a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got furious and began to use swearing -- the word for C and the word for F -- in a high tone...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from a bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBell attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her companion had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The little girl cried so much that she threw up, she added.
The family later sent a note to LaBell demanding an apology, but did not get a response.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBell are not answering the calls for comment.
No compensation was reported, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken up the case free of charge and that the family intended to donate any money that he received to charity for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBell answer for what he did," said Davis.
"This behaviour is absolutely unacceptable, especially with regard to the teacher of the nursery with an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate issues have slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López's reign in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market grew, foreign financing declined and the economy was weakened.
It is a year that will be included in Sinaloa's economic history as associated with the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, also known as the year of change, which has raised high hopes for economic development, but, given the poor climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but there has been a decline in key economic performance.
The low temperature of February not only lost millions in the agricultural sector, but it limited the growth potential of the public economy, resulting in a total decline of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historical fall of 31.16 per cent in the agricultural sector, which affected the performance of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on areas affected by seams provided by the Mexican Council for the sustainable development of rural areas, 835,582 acres were affected, of which 78,03 per cent were affected, while the remaining 21,07 per cent were partially affected; the main damaged crops were vegetables, maize and sout.
The decline in economic activity led to a steady increase in the state's unemployment rate, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters, an accelerated increase in the rate of unemployment, from January to March 55.553 people were unemployed, with a share of 4.53% of the economically active population, in the second quarter the rate rose to 5.28%, and from July to September it continued to grow to 619%, a percentage that accounts for more than 74,000 unemployed people in Sinloa, representing an increase of 18.969 more than the first half.
Liquidity decrease
Joblessness in Sinaloa has been addressed by many factors during the year; for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autional University (UAS), the rising rate of employment can be explained indirectly by actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to a number of factors, including the loss of market fluidity, in order to limit the resources provided by the law which was adopted by the Congress to combat money-laundering, since it is difficult for people who hold illegal dollars to work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Stopped Immigration
López Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in the rate of unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state in search of work abroad in the United States has been restricted, mainly because of the difficulty of entering, and the second because once they have entered, they already face very many difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, resulting in an increase in the rate of employment," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of Sinaloa's labour market is getting worse if you take into account the large number of labour-dominated labour-related disturbances, according to INEGI, 60,38% of the active population is employed without being mentioned as employees in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregular registration, another reminder of employment in the State is provided by low wages; the lowest wages in the State, according to the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
Sinaloa's average monthly income was up to September 5,352 peso, much lower than the national average of 7,375.
Reducing FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high rate of unemployment, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630,697 between January and July. This represents a decline of 87.74 per cent, compared with $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the State Government's Ministry of Economic Development recorded only 17,280,000 peso investments during the year, which were mainly from the service sector.
Duty
Against the background of the economic slowdown, in July the state government requested the approval of a 3 billion peso loan during the State Congress, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, at the local level only 2,600 million peso were approved, and until November there was no debt advantage expected in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For businessmen, Mario López Valdez's first year of government shows a lack of government capacity.
Michael Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturers, said that during 2011 there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The efficiency of the Sinaloa economy has been really low this year, has to work hard to regain the positions lost this year, in 2012 we must redouble our efforts, we have not been able to agree on the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
The slowing down of the economy
López Loredo said that events such as early freezes this year stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
"The low size of the economy is the result of several events, including cold, and one of the main effects has been a slow economy, which is not getting fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows it to have an appropriate level of processes, goods and services, and therefore at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations," he said.
Redirection
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Federation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic productive activity.
"In general, we have found that we have been working on this, and we believe that there is a need to develop a long-term programme that will rethink the direction and economic direction of the state, and to mobilise all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction in order to better guide government efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government is trying to be successful in various areas; there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He said that the current Administration had shown progress in its own manner of public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is beginning to get involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government realizes that there's still a lot to do," he said.
He's sentenced for 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days in revenue -- this sentence was handed down to a citizen of Navolato for possessing eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Office of the Public Prosecutor reported that the convicted drugdealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who had been convicted of a crime against health, was in this case possessing marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
In the case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during a patrol of Cypruso Valdez Street, in front of Post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drugdealer was driving a white pickup truck, in which he carried a black bag in a car drawer and on the passenger seat a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seized person was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused remains a prisoner at the Centre for Support for the Legal Effects of Crime.
Need to contribute to the work
Public works related to such programs as the Homeland, the Saving of Public Spaces and 3x1 for immigrants risk remaining unfinished or long delayed due to a lack of funds, said Michael Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Public Social Development indicated that, although work programs had been developed so far, they were in danger because the state government was unable to make appropriate contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesoes for all three programs.
He pointed out that the total funding for all three programs was about 50 million Peso, of which the State was expected to contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the City had provided resources for the work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny when they should have given us a part since the beginning of July," he said, "to keep up, we've started work and they've made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it was expected to make, so at the beginning of the term the city had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that had not been provided by the State Administration.
"It happened to us in the previous administration because the state had no financial means to participate, and the programs continued to develop, and this year, in order to gain access to these programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state owes," he explained.
While the state authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the secretary of administration and finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that the interest associated with them would come as soon as possible.
"They have to pay almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny."
The court will approve the " digital television transition" in Mexico in 2015
Changing analogues to digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (JC) rejected the constitutional motions made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential decree, which moved the so-called digital television transition from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes were not obtained to cancel it.
A minority of four Ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing the steps taken to move to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims submitted by the Senate were rejected because of the absence of a qualified majority of the eight votes required for the court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree and it remains in force.
The draft declaration, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, suggested that the decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme is a right established by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legal reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Marguerite Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this ground, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional discussions to challenge the decree and support complaints, and Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it concerning the transition to digital broadcasting.
It was also decided at the meeting to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the draft in that the Federal Executive could not determine the general rules for the measures to be prepared by the public administration.
“I also do not believe that if this were the case, it would affect the autonomy of the regulating body” and recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, has to do with the Federal Executive, which has a constitutional mandate, government.
Replacement of analogues with digital signals, one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years, has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of transformation into digital form, which includes meeting public needs that have not only a technical dimension, “because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These issues, he said, “requests the work of the entire system of public economic management to include a group of authorities which the Constitution unites into the State Executive”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital broadcasting process and had done so with the help of the Executive, despite the existence of highly specialized technical institutions.
From this it cannot be concluded that the Government, by passing the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of the Congress, ensures, in the administrative sphere, the observance of the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacana, an analysis is made of the possibility of counting "voice-to-voice"
According to data submitted to the PRRA, the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 out of a total of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of counting the “vote-by-vote” process this year in Michoacán is real, where, according to the Preliminary Results Program (PPP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting 879 of the total of 6.074 protocols.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Michokan Election Institute (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Landeral Saragos, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the Election Corps adopted a set of principles to align local rules with the federal election reform.
It should be borne in mind that Michoacán did not accept the Constitution or the State Election Code or the Voting Rights Act, as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal time frame for their entry into force in this election process and that the Governor, Léonel Godoy Rangel, did not include its publication within the time frame set by the Act in the Official Gazette of the State, arguing that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJ) decided on a constitutional claim submitted by the local legislature and called the state's representative's vote on constitutional reform “unvalid and illegal” because it had no right to “permit or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of a "voice for vote," Mary de Los Angeles Landerall argued that, with the adoption of suitable principles by the General Council of IWM, it would be possible to present a partial or complete counting of votes by the local election body.
For example, a partial recalculation of one or more voting urns may be made under the conditions that: the results of the protocols do not match; there is no record of voting and the counting of documents in the urn or it is not in the hands of the chairman; or there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, the total recalculation of votes in all the urns in the elections may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged winner of the elections in question and the second-place candidate is less than or equal to 1 per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition who has submitted the second of those candidates.
The total recalculation of votes will also be made if at the end of the normal counting it is determined that the difference between the winner and the second-place candidate is less than or equal to 1 per cent, provided that there is a request from a political party whose candidate has second-placed, in the event that the voting boxes which have been considered in partial recalculation are excluded.
It is worth noting that this is the case with the Morelia elections, where according to PDRP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even if there are no 129 votes out of a total of 923 protocols.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortez arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; on Monday an examination and a resting Mass was carried out.
According to the family, the last wish of the Lt. Col. was to be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam.
After accepting sympathy with other people who died in a disaster, the Basio Cortez family returned to the capital of Coauila on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft and attended a ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the lieutenant-colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on the Nazario Cortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 a.m. he was examined by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during high school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and that his ashes should be scattered in the Sapalinama Mountains, he always said it to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortez Basio, the sister of the pilot.
In her opinion, the lieutenant colonel had lived up to all his dreams, she believed that he was at the top of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother, devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortez Basio left Saltillo very young to join the Aeronautical Academy in Sapopana, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he had a dizzy head even in the truck, but he always wanted to live up to his dream of piloting.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Davila Basio, remembers him as a very good man "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him as he brought Martha Sagan to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopán to attend the graduation ceremony of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in his life: driving a plane.
He's being led on the last track.
Shots were fired in honour of Lt. Col. of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortez Basio, led by the governor of Jorge Torres Lopez, people from the village and government of the state, the Mexican army, from the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo High School of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and made progress both in his studies and in his sports, led him to the last journey.
Basio Cortez died recently when the helicopter he was driving crashed, along with the secretary of the government of the Province, Jose Francisco Black Sea, and six others, all the representatives of the Ministry.
At 6:05 p.m. the remains of Basio Cortez (created), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over by the funeral office to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major James Martinez, to the Esplanade of the training school, where his family was already waiting for him, including his daughter, Amanda and his wife, Christina, her mother, her brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned on the NL Caderate farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities had shown to the media 11 people who had been arrested in the same town for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of their body with a background shot at an abandoned farm in the city of Cadereita Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery was found on the 1.5 km Cadereita highway towards Santiago, on a hill in a Commune known as El Castillo.
Several people passing by noticed that in a village house with a wall painted in beige and brown, the gate was open.
When they looked inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, and they immediately informed the authorities concerned.
One of the men wore a yellow shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
Almost one metre was the body of another person, wearing a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no shell casings on the scene.
On the fence of the village house there are signs addressed by one organized criminal group of the other, also there are several bullet holes in it and at the gate.
11 caught in the Cadet
The Ministry of National Security has presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group which was mainly operating in the town of Cadereit and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, “smuggling” and secret graves.
According to published information, on November 11th, eight people were arrested in the Los Alvero colony and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding that they become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
A second event occurred on November 12th at 06:00 a.m., military officers made a round trip to the village of Old Rancho in Cadreita, when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the cabin.
After stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of bullets.
Later, on 13 November, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Truth, who, when the military saw him, was trying to escape.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Cadereita.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce a new government that will face the crisis that put this country on the verge of an economic catastrophe.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the Italian President on Wednesday to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the verge of an economic catastrophe and has damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form a government.
He was expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it was not clear when the new executive branch would take up its positions.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to prove my complete confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period," said the former European commissioner to reporters.
Monty did not explicitly say that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that obstacles had been overcome.
"The artwork is now well marked," he said.
Monty completed the government formation process in less than three days, much less than usual, because Italy was struggling with the political and financial crisis, which brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration, under the leadership of former European commissioner Monty, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders in order to regain confidence in Italy.
On the basis of pressure on Monty to hurry, unstable markets have set up revenue from the BTP bonds of Italy for 10 years over 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian employers' Federation, informed reporters after meeting with Monty, "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this government is Italy's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to retire on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good result," said Angelino Alphano, secretary of the Central-Right Party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have resisted the government majority of technocrats that form Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty government must have strong parliamentary support for reform, which will probably be unpopular reforms of austerity.
Any blocking or suspending of these attempts can lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
An Italian association of foreign banks has increased pressure, warning that Monty's failure can be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations on Monday with political parties, associations and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish a series of his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who resolved a very rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would retire, the value of Italy's debt had now reached a critical level, given the uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Salvaging Italy with a government debt of Euro1.8 billion would be too much for modern euro-zone financial advocates.
Monty said that his government would exist until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to reform before he ordered a new election.
Monty said he wanted politicians to be included in his cabinet, but the main parties insisted that it should be composed only of technical experts, evidence of their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources reported that the mutual mistrust and opposition of the parties made it more difficult to attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish have more game experience than the Ticos.
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international games.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 games.
There is a slight contrast with Costa Rica, compared to the 22 players that the two countries called for a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San Jose National Stadium.
While the world and Europe champions, number one in FIFA's monthly ratings, have a whole list of class A selection games, Tricolour only has a defender of Michael Uman as the only one who has performed 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2) at the Romel-Fronandez Stadium.
Spanish football players playing in the League of All Stars and in the strong premiere clubs of England have been very active this year in the league and local championships, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
In addition, the experience of the Spanish fury in complex skills in the European Union or the World Cup is worth adding.
The players, however, have limited international experience in a zone such as CONCACAF, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he runs a list for the Spanish Hollywood team, Icker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (a mutch lost 0-1 in London) repeated an ex-golycper record for Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Kasillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, a player in Barcelona, has 106 games.
Kasillas and Javi were declared the best of the last week by UEFA, together with another player of the Iberian team, Subisarret, with 126 matches and a bombarder, Shalke Raoul Gonzalez, with 102.
Almost closes to a hundred Carles Puilles games with 97 games.
Javi Alonso has followed them since 91, Fernando Torres since 90, David Villa and Sergei Romeo, both from 81, Andres Iñesta from 62, Sesk Fabregas from 61, and David Silva from 53.
Costa Rica next to Michael Umana, left side-by-side Juniore Diaz with 48 matches and bombarder Brian Ruiz with 45.
Next, only five have crossed the 30 games: Calor Navas with 31, Randall Asoffeit with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36, and Jose Luis López with 35, respectively.
Remaining.
More than 30 matches in Spain were played by Gerard Pique (37), Sherlock Bousquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raoul Albiola (31).
There's Roy Miller with 26 matches in the team with less than 30 exits, with 26 matches, with 26 wins, with 26 wins, with Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murey with 23 games.
The rest didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Morelia has only four games and Hordi Alba has two games, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
Spain's leading player, David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by FernandoTorres since 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz became the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernandez and three times as Roy Murry and Parks.
Quintette took the country on a 20-year career tour.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true."
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Ament from Purl Jam, he said that the band was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There were over 20 years of waiting, but the group says it's also a dream that has become a reality for them to play in this country.
This was a statement by a bass player and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is based in South America as part of a 20-year tour and on Sunday, the 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with a team from Los Angeles, The X, and a local group called Las Roberttas.
This is a piece of conversation that is fully decrypted online on The National.
For your Costa Rican fans, is this the dream that Purl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is just our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once -- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring our music there.
I'm asking because there's some dedication to the group; fans live under strain the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most devoted fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat him like the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest show we've played in the past 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We had a couple of great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this brought us into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surf friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and in Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, it's great places for surfing, and that's how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
When you look at the tour, you can say that you've made a huge show with lots of songs.
What are you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no limitations on what we can do.
We'll try to make the best show possible with a variety of songs; we'll try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat a repertoire.
How does that work?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everybody likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in a tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us and so I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This tour marks 20 years of career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I think none of us ever imagined that we would be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We enjoy our luck and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world where we've always wanted to go.
Things are coming together very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the bloom of the gem?
It has always been an honour to be part of this group of great communities.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhony and Alice in Chains.
It's great when a movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, one group from the same city appears, but much more oddly, when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We're proud and we're honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them, and it's our honor to be part of the sound of Seattle that came out.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together for so long.
Yeah, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which itself is much longer than there are many groups.
First, I think we're lucky that we're still alive, and secondly, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, we have also opened musical roads that give everyone freedom of experimentation.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't have been better.
Your attitude to the word of glory was difficult; but thanks to your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find the balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to find a balance.
We care not to be on tour too long, because it's easy to get into this game by large crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you must respect music and what made it, without choosing to be famous and to be a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project, Monday Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years and we haven't released any albums until Andy's death.
There was a lot of disappointment because it lasted so long, and most importantly, we were still close friends with Bruce (Ferweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a picture, I think of the incredible man who was Andy, and as he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and a lot of other things.
It was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local Los Robertas band will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you are familiar with her work, especially with Addy Vedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yeah, the producers sent us some video offers, and it was a band that we liked most, so we're excited to see what Las Roberttas can offer live, and it must be very exciting.
Why do you always change the word in Yellow Ledbeter at concerts?
That's a question to Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes into his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There are so many.
Among the first to come to mind are Giser Butler, John Antvisle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassians I love.
How did Purl Jam succeed in keeping the grunge relevant, even though it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a bit distracted from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminded me of the groups I mentioned earlier, like Mudhony, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's the music that should be listened to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music better than ever.
At first your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are a few songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Briate that are considered very gloomy, though they may sound a little positive.
Both, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs were very gloomy.
I think that when you grow up and there's been some kind of an accident in your life and you lose a member of your family or friend, these events begin to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examination.
Ex-Peter Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the public hospital, and his family doctor reported to the hospital for a muscle loss.
Fujimori, 72 years old, sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from a number of diseases, including language cancer, which has caused him to be operated four times and monitored.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastics to determine the cause of pain and loss of power in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that he believed that Fujimori should be a candidate for the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried out four operations on tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms in weight, and other diseases, such as a strong erosion gastrit, pancreas cysts, renal stones, high blood pressure and blood flow problems, were listed by the doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Special Operations Bureau.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the army destruction force, which operated secretly during the first years of his reign.
Mujika is going to Mexico to fortify political ties
An official delegation led by President Jose Muhika of Uruguay and composed of several Ministers and businessmen will come to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to start talks on the political problems of the region.
Mujika will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important point in the extensive plan of meetings with the political, commercial and Uruguayan communities in Mexico, according to a timetable published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalajara will be "favourable for the exchange of information on political relations between the two nations," as the South American leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking support for Uruguay in an incident with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy listed the South American country as a tax haven at a G20 meeting in the French city of Canne.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to remove from the international community those countries that remained tax havens a statement that had prompted a protest by Uruguay and a withdrawal for consultation by his European ambassador.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the most developed and developing countries, and in fact has had an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxes.
The Government of Uruguay has endeavoured in recent years to accelerate the conclusion of tax exchange arrangements in order to leave the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's grey list drawn up from countries that do not enjoy international standards of tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay had been in force since 2004 with the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which had increased trade between the two countries.
The mustard plumber will be 3D with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought relentlessly for over 25 years to save princess Peach from Bouseer's evil paws, but he had never done so in three dimensions before: in Super Mario 3D Land he would fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was designed to take into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which makes it possible to play in three dimensions without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a hero who has to report how stereoscopes are going to work without glasses," said the head of Nintendo's press office in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially designed for this platform" because until now successful products like Star Fox 64 3D or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adaptive to existing games.
Nintendo said that, despite its existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once in a while, most experts will go "second round" to levels of the game that are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D Aggressive" or something that only affects the depth of the action, but that needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome a variety of obstacles and "do not accept optical illusions."
This super Mario invasion in three dimensions also marks the return of the hero to the laptop console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the show and repeats the successful formula from the previous games, a plumber with a mustache has to go through dangerous mined platforms to free princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the Luigi Player.
Cola guarantees Portillo's surrender to the United States
President Álvaro Kolom said on Tuesday that the process of the surrender of Alphonse Portillo had begun so that he would answer in the United States for a plot to wash $70 million.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to a request from a northern country that requested the surrender of Portillo to be tried there.
At a press conference, Kolom said that his decision related to the independence of the judicial and executive branches, given that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He argued that during his term he had not “handed hands” to legal decisions and had accepted all the procedures for the extradition he had ever known of.
Together with Portillo Sergio Roano Marroquin will be acquitted for murder and serious injuries, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug sales.
What Kolom has done shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted in order to prosecute the ex-head of State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CPC), Portillo will be extradited once, with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of the Q120 million waste in the Ministry of Defence during the Presidential term, which was a pre-removal process, but the Ministry of Public Relations filed an appeal and reopened the case.
Trijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was set up to prevent the exclusion of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Trijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people who are vulnerable to social exclusion have helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary gave rise to a ceremony in the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijov appeared next to the Villa Trinitate in 1986 to help young people with education, lack of work and drug or marginalisation problems.
Yesterday's Sant Andreu celebration brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have been working with the association during the past 25 years.
A different political perspective during the elections showed the single nature of the work done by Trinijov.
Following the President of the Generality, Arthur Mass, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, the ceremony was attended by an ex-Consultant of the Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and an ex-leutenant of the mayor and the current eco-socialist, a member of the town council, Ricard Gom.
He also appeared in Fabra I Coats, a current social well-being and family consultant, Josep Lewis Cleris, and the CoEO for social work at La Caixa, Homee Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijov had come into existence in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation."
The President cited Trinijov as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and the instilling of hope in people in difficulty.
"Crisis is not new to the organization and work done to her," he said.
The seized building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of a building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday afternoon without a struggle.
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living in the 51st Street of Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people yesterday at noon voluntarily left the building they were occupying illegally and where they organized mass parties that irritated the neighbors by a court order without police interference.
When the operation was over, the lock on the door was changed to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"There'll be a pass check from now on," said the manager.
The scooters, who took 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest were settled, took all the electricity and some water, painted walls and left traces of various kinds, especially bottles of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a mass party site, which lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Mary Pantinat, told Europe Press that since the building was occupied her income had fallen by 80 percent.
The owner of the club said that the invaders of the building had engaged her in an unfair competition because they were selling drinks for three euros, while at the club for ten.
Moreover, the discotheque owner had to respond to the neighbors' noise complaints, although she noticed that the noise was caused not by the members of the club, but by the inhabitants of the squats and, above all, by those attending the parties that were organized there, whose frequency and intensity had increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now, he's forgiven her rent.
The City police also confirmed that in recent weeks more complaints had been received from neighbours about the situation.
The President of the PP, Councillor Alberto Fernando Díaz, demanded last week to “evacuate the building immediately in order to address the problems of co-existence and shared spirit of neighbours and degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that until summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the last few months squatters had invaded all floors and almost every room and that some had been broken into.
In this sense, he added that “there is a need to put an end to the culture of impunity and to resist the culture of the building.”
So yesterday, the police evaced the building in Noo Barris.
At 3:30 the police left for Montral Street, 35 following a call from a neighbour who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a competition after a dispute over contributions
The 16-door town pageant reopened the debate on the role of Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the rise of the now-defunct Barcelona Capital Corp, this administration published posters for Kolserola.
The bookt described the mountain as a large park in Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison of images with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the SSC, in 1987 the park re-entered into the consciousness of many as the highest point in Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few, which is focused not on the north-south, but on the upper (mountain) to the lower (sea).
The positioning of Kolserola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as a Yogi bear.
That was until September, the council announced a huge competition, composed of 16 competitions for a lot of other gates to Kolcerole.
The gate means the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gates on the field.
The question is, Colserola, a park or a mountain?
The competition, and its organization, and its impact on the city, is a subject for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
It's almost the most repetitive topic to discuss when two members of this chosen tribe recognize each other in the elevator.
And that's exactly one of the few overlaps between what the three architects of Barcelona say and the scientists who were present.
Michael Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: The competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain" when the offer of Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
"We have to assume that the biggest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, it's beautifully accessible.
Colserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the heading of the Colserola gate contains a "word trap": we should not think of them as "as the entrance to the park, but as limiting some areas where we must act."
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayon, with experience in urban construction, called the sentence "the intellectual challenge" with "some danger."
Risks due to the "uncertainty of the prediction of public space" after the experience of the 1980s, which ended on the site of the "his swan song" Forum.
The first fear is actually limiting the boundaries where you can build.
"Restricting something is preparing the next step," is a transition.
"We must think about new urban planning tools, because current [as far as the Capital Master Plan (GSP) is concerned] can lead to real trouble."
Closer to the point, Modolo believes that simplifying the Kolserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, rather than" as a purely topographic question.
Modolo remembers that there is already work done outside of Calcerola, which "do not miss his ears," although he is grateful for the opportunity that the City Hall is offering him to join the project "from the beginning."
And what's more, he realizes that the proximity of a mountain to a city is a pass that allows architects to enter into a debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is something that should lead in-depth teams ("success," he claims) which should have created: "Architectors should only be an instrument."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that asks the title of this part is complex, because the rules of the competition do not contain a general form of Colserola: "There have been 16 overlapping competitions announced," he says, "in the sense of the sea-mount, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the whole area."
This makes it possible, at least in his case, to accept 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for one gate may overlap with a program and definition with an architect project for the neighbouring gate.
From your point of view, the council must ensure that the strip directly above the RONDA-DALT should provide, in its completeness, an area designed to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The Casino pardons Jonas Larrasabal and will be released
After 72 days of settlement, the judge, Red Casino, pardoned the brother of the mayor of Monterrey on charges of blackmail.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legal representative, Red Casino, has pardoned him before the Second Criminal District Court, which prosecutes the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergei Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos in which he was allegedly asked by Manuel Jonas to pay an economic contribution so that the authorities of Monterrey would allow a secret operation in the gaming house.
Following a public conviction, the State Attorney-General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old capital of the State.
He remained there for 49 days, following the second order to ban movement after the prosecutor had ruled out bribe crimes and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereita for allegedly extorting half a million peso from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with a moderate isolation of the prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue to serve in the San Nicholas prison in Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by the Second Criminal District Court's secretary, Jorge Janez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, evidence of Jonah's guilt was evident enough, such as the collection of 1.5 million peso from the bookkeepers in exchange for authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, appeared before Judge Jose Luis Pesina to seek pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released within the next few hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor at the trial, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether he had recovered the damage and which of the partners of the Gaming House would grant a pardon, although the lawyer had tried not to pronounce the name.
On the basis of a record of 197/2011, a legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal and no statements could be made about the process which had been scheduled against him; nor would any compensation or punishment be required.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the bookie, at almost 3:50 p.m., Larrasabal Breton was ordered to be released immediately.
The judge, Jorge Janez, went to the San Nicholas prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally pardoned and that his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Perez Hacome talks about the details of the disaster that killed the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results of the accident, during which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Black More, and seven others were killed, showed that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in a state of complete integrity, without attempting to launch an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Perez Hacome, the Minister of Communications and Transport, said that the pilot had discovered that the weather conditions were suitable for flight before the aircraft went up.
"Elements which seem to have shown that the ship had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with trees 25 meters where the device lost the fluid."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons and therefore met the necessary requirements for the carriage of persons.
He also said that the studies carried out in the area of impact did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"The study reports that there are no components of the vessel elsewhere; the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helipad was intended for 19 passengers, which met the requirements for the transport of passengers.
The earth in this place has a slope of between seven and thirty degrees.
At this point, the secretary said, is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study may take a few months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the strike the Presidential helicopter had been driven at cruise speed and that it had happened on soft rising soil.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal flight manoeuvre at the moment of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Perez Hacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to air rules, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must be visible during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports found suitable conditions for taking off when the aircraft flew to the border between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
Perhaps because of cloud conditions, the team was searching for a lower height and greater visibility in the Quaernavac Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the strike and the last record from the aircraft's radar are likely not to have lost control or changed direction before the strike.
Scattering of pieces in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact occurred on the front and side lines.
The spread of the wreckage suggests that the helicopter encountered the ground in structural integrity.
No apparent signs of fire or explosion were found:
Uninheritable evidence remains in the disaster zone in the wreckage of the ship, some sort of explosion or fire.
Recent studies have shown that there may have been multiple contacts with the ground.
During their work on the ground, pieces of an aircraft were found at a height of 1,200 feet above sea level, and the ground has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The images show the sequence in which it collapsed along the way.
The information contains facts which seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After careful study in more areas than the defined zone near the crash site, no dispersed parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the attack occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces a program to find the obesity gene
Social protection leads research on the obesity gene of children and young people; it is supported by IPN experts
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that a study is being carried out to detect the obesity gene of children and young people, which is known as the protocol “Genetics of Obesity in Children and Adolescence” which will provide an estimate of signs of overweight.
In his statement, the Head of the Biochemistry Unit of the 21st-century National Medical Centre, Michael Crus Lopez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is supported by experts and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (described or not) is invited to attend MSSI sports centers participating in the study and to the Mexico Valley, where children will be tested every Saturday at 8 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol had begun at a sports centre in Cuautemoko (West Mexico) and that since 8 October the events had been held at a sports centre in Nesaualcovotl (East Mexico).
Once the goal of reaching 500 to 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Centre (South Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north Mexico City).
He explained that the aim of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to determine the risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
On 14 November, the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated, with the main goal of bringing together three thousand children and young people between 6 and 14 years of age, with the permission and care of their parents, to complete their individual dietary profiles.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometry would be performed by all participants (weight, growth and waist cover), blood pressure and levels of glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify the genes associated with child obesity).
Crus Lopez said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in the weight of children.
Medical studies carried out between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there has been an increase in only six years: 77 percent of boys suffer from obesity, 47 percent of girls; for overweight there has also been a significant increase,” said MSI specialist.
He said that the validity of finding markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other people in their genetic history.
He reported that, on average, the Mexican is 65 percent of the American Indians, 30 percent of the Europeans, and 5 percent of the Africans, and this condition has affected the genes associated with diabetic and overweight.
He explained that mainly the result of obesity genetics is the body's failure to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and it's delayed as fat.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit to the participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, having dark folds around the neck (cants) and forearms means the possibility of breaking metabolism and even a prediabate.
Information is provided in a confidential manner, and doctors hand it over in writing to parents, to whom they explain all the dimensions and changes in the way of life that must be made in order to avoid the disease.
Crus Lopez explained that there are three main reasons for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sitting down, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day in front of the TV, and using short distance transport instead of walking.
This is also due to the high calorie intake, i.e. the increase in the consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (toms, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic predisposition, as analyzed in this program.
Asphalt UNAM can avoid cracks
Raphael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality that is resistant to environmental and temperature effects.
If attention had been paid to the signals sent by the road cover, it would have been necessary to repair about 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the Mexico City Valley, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, and adds that if the process of construction and maintenance of the asphalted road surface is correct, the number of pits may be reduced or even reduced to zero.
In his lecture, the Technical View of the pits, read during the International Year of Chemistry, reported that the laboratory for which it is responsible is developing polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of characteristics close to the bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperature.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, in order to improve the quality of roads and therefore resist the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the hardest part of oil, is the sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some are the high molecular mass, called asphalt, and others are the low molecular mass, called maltens, which together provide road cover for its distinctive viscosity.
The viscosity of the bitumen is the fact that in high temperatures about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it keeps almost solid, while at very low temperature the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not constant, but changes during the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, by a specialist in chemical engineering.
The chemist observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexibly covered, composed of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen composed of small stones, put into bitumen and then compressed.
Every stone that forms this surface, he said, is sunk in bitumen.
When driving and applying effort, this helps the forces to be very well distributed on the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they'd be even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt cover, he added, placed the last layer, called the dew layer, which is made of small stones, actually sand also dipped into asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will be in contact with the wheels of transport, it must have more resistance than asphalt cover and provide for road friction.
As part of the road surface which will receive and disseminate these forces, the wear layer also requires the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
The weather, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it has a significant effect on the condition of asphalt.
When the ground is raw, the water penetrates the surface and it's hard to get out of there, it makes all the layers of the surface softened and hence the formation of a pit.
When forming a pit, he said, the first thing to wear is the dew layer and then it affects the bitumen, but the damage doesn't happen instantly, which is a process that should be taken into account at the first signs of maintenance programs.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transport is another important factor in creating holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer must always be linked to the transport burden and must be guaranteed to meet this requirement in order to prevent the frequent occurrence of pits.
Rafael Herrera said that relatively bitumen still needs to be studied and done, for example, with the bitumen emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even help to fix holes easily and without the use of high temperature.
What wasn't enough for a candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Columbia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serne Melina Ramírez from getting the crown of Miss Columbia.
The representative of Valle won the princess' title 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has only to want the crown of Miss Columbia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Cerna was to be satisfied with having hit the runway of the winners with a silver crown and a ribbon calling her the new princess of Colombia.
In light of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and scepter, the department has 14 renowned princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but who were declared princesses, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Klara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Patrice Belini Ayal (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blanquez (88), Monica Evers (89), Maria Sunsuela Pinedo (1989), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hesei Alhore Garces (2000), Catalino Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie Harris Alhury.
A question that many now ask:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in each performance showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Columbia, not just by being chosen by the Queen of the police and by the most beautiful person in Vogue's version, the titles that the Queens held, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who received Miss Columbia's crowns.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to grant her the title of the First princess was that she was unable to answer the question, "What book characterizes you and why? " by Martin Murilla Gomez of the Literature Society, let's read.
She said to the person who asked:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I certainly think that the book describing my childhood, "The Little Prince," is a pretty deep book.
Today I read "Crime and Punishment," a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; and at the moment I am reading the book of Irina Nemira, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "The Fire of Blood."
The answer, which the jury did not like because of the term "cultivating" and, secondly, because it did not specifically explain how each of the quoted books described it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and satisfied with her result: "the universe is wise, what's going to happen."
And you all please read at least a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the alleged hypotheses, Valle was burned by favouritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that, because she was preferred, she was greeted with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the pre-finished prizes (Oster'sculinary competition, the audience vote for the best national costume, and the Queen-mother), "which triggered the jealousy of the other candidates, caused the Queen's stress, and as a result she did not glare on the stage."
And this was observed during her first appearance in a bathing suit on the Hillton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
While both looked confident, it was evident that she did not have the strength and energy that Magdalena and the Atlantic displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the "How Home" program on RCN, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess means that a candidate who won more prizes during the competition will not become a queen."
Moreover, the representative of Valle had recently avoided speaking to the press and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That's why, two days before the election, a member of the international jury, Lucille Doti, said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Columbia; we must not only look at the appearance but also focus on the public consciousness before they take part in the competition, they must be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also a suggestion that the representative of Valle had sinned by a defect in her buttocks and fibrosis, which was seen on her belly, but this is debatable, as the jury highlighted her as a candidate with "natural beauty," taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The consultant to Queen Jorge Hernán Orosco notes that Melina had not the best body that was even better, "but the problem of the fibrosis on her belly, which was not very visible to me, caused her to lose her glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Giddo Oios of Cromos magazine believed that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she had been subjected to surgical interference.
"Operations are good, but representative Valle doesn't know how to make them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize which was first presented by the National Beauty Contest organisers, the cruel prediction came true last night, they say it was a jewel that Raimundo gave to Melina as compensation for losing her pleasure in getting the crown.
Whether or not, the fact is that Melina is now beginning a year of government, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that enables her to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions that was directly named by the organizers of the National Contest.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena pageant, faced difficulties in getting the crown.
This was the work of the man who ID'd the body of Alphonse Cano.
CSI from Cali came into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alphonse Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the head of the FARC, A.C.
Of the seven CTI experts, Elizar Gonzalez, a man from Puerto Tehad who had spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation, had been in the queue this week.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the towns of Choco, where he often had to travel for more than five days through the jungle to reach the location where the bodies were to be identified.
He moved to Valle in 2000 and became a specialist in criminal science, where he studied skin friction, i.e. hand and foot.
During the week of Elizar's operation to identify a man known as Alphonse Cano, he was told to take up his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was coming.
On Friday night he arrived by helicopter from Cauca to Palmira.
He knew he would need to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest Partizan War, so they asked him to take ten images of Guillermo Leon Saens' prints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with a research team at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it externally; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He had no beard, dressed like a local farmer, no glasses, and much thinner.
But prints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, spade, and lantern, Elizar compared the body's fingerprints with those on the photos.
His eyes did not fail: it was Alphonse Cano.
That same night, the Puerto Tehad representative was asked to confirm to the Defence Minister, Juan Carlos Pinson, that it was the head of the FARC
Search for Fingerprints
For a fingerprint specialist in the Sijin division of Cali, the confession received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar Gonzalez at a press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopie is a strict science, and without mistakes, it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, fingerprinters are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and identify the detained persons.
When arrested, many criminals have false or undocumented IDs.
We take their prints and we look for them in the database.
The researcher said that in the case of theft he had to move a piece of the wall to the house because the thief had his hands in this place to take over a safe full of jewels and money.
"It is hard to work with walls because they are not comfortable surfaces to remove prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire hand and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he claims.
Fingerprints also help to disallow or determine the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
Recently found a dead man with bottles of liquor around him.
During the investigation, it was found that the crime could have been suspected by a relative and, indeed, the fingerprints on the bottle matched.
Although it doesn't guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves he was at the scene of the murder.
The CTI fingerprint specialist explained that a chemical or physical reagent is applied to the places where prints are found.
When they appear, a spade or ribbon is used to remove them.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into the register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI program.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves prints on it.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
Angrily people challenge the New York authorities
Hundreds of protesters broke up a camp in front of Zuccotti Square.
Some protesters heard the court order to disperse the demonstration from the square and went to the park next door.
The Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter, under protection of a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn while attempting to take over another Big Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters dug up at Zukotti Square, where they wanted to go, thanks to a court order that allowed angry people to break up a camp on the square while another part of the movement responded by taking over the park in the north of the city, where further arrests were carried out
"Our idea is that, since the court won't let us set up a camp in the square, we'll break up the camp somewhere else and continue the trial struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a member of the Wall Street Conquest movement.
Bray explained that the response of the "frequent people" to the evac of the tenement site, ordered personally by the New York City Mayor, Michael Blumberg, had been brought to court, where Judge Lucie Billings had issued an order that prohibited forced escape from the square and allowed demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the angry people began to take over a new park located at the junction site of Channel Street Central Street and 6th Avenue, near the entrance to Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the trinity church parish.
At least an hour they could occupy the place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not give an exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization asserts that several hundred people were standing with the tents in the place where the religious leaders' delegation went to show their support by attempting to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zukotti Square, which is a private domain, remains closed pending a trial scheduled for this Tuesday, which will address the validity of this morning's protests.
Some of the protesters on their way there carried and distributed copies of the warrant and even gave copies to police officers who were guarding the square, leading to “some small clashes”, said Bray, who stated that some police officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prevents the authorities from evacing members of the Occupy Wall Street movement and from enforcing “the laws that have been issued since the beginning of the invasion or from preventing demonstrators from re-entering the park with shops and other property used previously”.
Mr. Bloemberg told reporters that due to this court order the city had suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators had been informed of it, but local laws prevented them from reopening their tent shops and sleeping bags.
A member of the council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation during which about 200 arrests were carried out, and the decision was made because the protesters were “infringing the law”.
Bloemberg said that he had ordered the square to be cleared because it had become "a place where people had come not to protest but rather to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others" because "some businesses had been threatened" and the neighbors were afraid "of the quality of life."
The escape this morning was repulsive and shows that deep down in Bloemberg's heart, there is a greater interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” added a representative of the movement who denounces the mayor for "discretion of freedom of speech."
Those responsible for the Wall Street Harvesting also indicated that they intended to organize a “grandiary action” on Thursday, in collaboration with civil society organizations and trade union organizations, in order to recall the last two months of protests which had begun on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Buble and other distinguished Canadians, she will appear in the television program "The Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1.
Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "The Great Repair", rescuer in Malibu's Saviors, Bunny in Playboy, wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private CTV announced today that Anderson, along with a dancer, Michael Bubble, and other prominent Canadians, would appear on the December 1st television program, "The Christmas of Russell Peters," as a very special Mary.
CTV today presented images of a television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread web-based home pornography video where she appeared with her then husband, the drummer of the group "Mötley Crüe" by Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding in her nursery a doll depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian who recently played the "My cruel torpedo of truth" tour, Charlie Sheena appeared as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian singer named Bubble, who married Louisiana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, is part of a special Christmas show called CTV.
Recently, Buble called the American sister Kim Kardashian at one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan, revived after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent because of domestic consumption and ended the fall which began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has caused a nuclear crisis, a terrible catastrophe carried over by the rising sun since the Second World War.
According to the first estimate of the government of Tokyo, the loss of property amounted to US$ 300,000 million, a blow that, despite the dire world situation, seems to be passing.
After three consecutive lost quarters, data on gross domestic product from July to September had certainly helped turn the page: GDP had increased by 1.5 per cent over the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in annual terms.
Registered in the second quarter, a financial year starting in March 2012 for Japan, also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The renaissance may be partly explained by the resuming of the purchase of machine equipment to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent Tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 percent against a 0.9 percent decrease in capital costs, which was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian momentum, which calls for the use of the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure by using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan had been awakened mainly by the growth of household consumption, which now stood at 60 per cent of Japan's GDP.
This figure has increased by 1% as a result of increased costs for cars, travel and rest.
The yen semblance
Tokyo provided the domestic market, when the yen, the Japanese currency, became one of the “currency havens” chosen by the investors who wanted to get rid of the euro zone debt crisis and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that presses, like stone, on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic policy is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sonia, for example, blames the yen for their low levels from July to September.
As long as the markets continue to be under siege by the EU peripheral countries, the government of Esichiko Noda does not reduce its alertness.
We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the degradation of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, said yesterday by the Minister of Economic Policy, Motohis Furukawa.
Indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator that predicts the breaks in the world economy has shown that major forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after it collapsed eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athenes again give rise to doubt
Daddimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatories wouldn't sign a single written obligation.
With peripheral risk and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to wander around the maze, leading to an end to the large European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new transitional government of Ellad is being demanded by Brussels rather than by the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Popedimos, warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reform and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient for their application, the leader of the Conservative party, New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that he would not support any further austerity and repeated his demand for the new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the 26 October summit, said the Popedomos yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will lead tomorrow to a vote of confidence by the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to increase employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, the message of Samaras does not explain his position: "We are willing to help the transitional government, but we promise nothing."
The leader of the Conservatives has done one step more in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, organizations that should defreeze the 8,000 million that Athens needs, and he has explained that he will not give his approval to any letter of consent to the requirements of the contract.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect of the papandrew referendum's approvals of everything or nothing, repeated yesterday that its requirements were clear: it would not resume assistance unless the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties signed a written agreement without any ambiguities and as soon as possible.
A representative of the Ministry of Economics, Amadeu Altafei, said that the troika inspectors could “really soon” return to Athens to discuss with the new government “what should be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date is not yet set.
There's enough thread in the Greek cube for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope."
The Queen underlined Spain's "main" place in respect of this type of finance.
Spain "has a prominent place in the world in the area of micro finance."
Queen Sofia reminded us yesterday that over the past two decades the country has become the second largest contributor to the tools of cooperation, whose "essentiality," she said, is that it is "a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on faith in people."
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid, convinced that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “fully necessary” in order to achieve the goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and “in particular with a view to halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty rate is fixed.
Spain "already works" to expand the network of recipients around the world and to take on this challenge with all "responsibility," says Doña Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "provide new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorer people, and especially for women, "the main recipients of these credits."
There are "many achievements" and "many difficulties we face."
The Microcredit Summit has become not only a platform for debate, but also a platform that promotes the two main goals.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and that one hundred million of these households would get out of the poverty they were in.
The momentum for the creation of a micro-lending system in Spain and the rest of the world “was on the path begun years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Mrs. Sofia as a “act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as "a striking idealist in the global fight against poverty," whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to explore his credit policies locally.
This experience took over a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Cote d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “everywhere I have seen continuous development”, said Her Majesty, whose connection to this project gave her yesterday the title of the “head of the family” gathered in Valladolid by the “poor banker”.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her statement by urging the participants to participate in the discussion and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative."
Trinidad Jiménez, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that solidarity was an “ethical imperative” for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, since it was a “continuing obligation”.
Jiménez concluded that micro-lending implies a “serious and firm course of action to eradicate poverty” and that “more than ever” developed country governments must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and prevent it from falling victim to spending.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the main areas of cooperation for development.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, commended the “success” in giving “confidence” to people who have all the doors closed in front of them, and the mayor of Valladolide, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed all those present in the city, who “opens his door in a spirit of solidarity”.
The CDU suggests that the President of the European Commission be elected by universal vote
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CPU) on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without significant problems for chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
Europe's future was not originally scheduled for the program, but it was the fall itself, particularly to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is far from as strict as it should be today with respect to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with respect to Italy....
The draft resolution on the European Commission presidency submitted by the management for discussion was adopted almost unanimity.
Of the 1001 members, only nine had voted against and 10 had refrained from voting.
The standing ovations, which lasted a few minutes, deserved by their presentations by Angel Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schoible, the Eurofile and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main message of the chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the motto: the correct answer to the crisis is “no less Europe, no more Europe”.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the chancellor, it's time for a breakthrough in Europe.
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Compact that make it possible for the European Union to exercise greater control over European Union financial policies, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by universal vote, “to give Europe a face”.
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, the idea of which apparently belongs to Wolfgang Shoible.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly accept this decision; Britain is opposed to it, and HDZ leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also against it.
But the soil is ready.
Likewise, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each member of the European Union in the European Central Bank, according to the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In an effort to calm the situation in her party, the chancellor had increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kole, but she had not sought to influence the convention at the expense of “small” European countries or countries in difficult circumstances that liked to criticize the “higher” Germany.
While the draft resolution on Europe focused a whole paragraph on the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just passing by.
Remember that two centuries ago Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most demeaning defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What is fraud with hospital sheets?
Following cash payments, the UMP and the government began to attack hospital lists.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will come to Bordeaux to visit the Family Allowances Foundation and give a speech on this issue, which has been regularly raised since 2007, on combating social security fraud.
And to help this offensive, which emerged from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but which also forms part of the right-wing campaign to re-elect as president, most want to concentrate on hospital leaves.
In the first instance, in view of budget saving, the Government intended to impose on private companies the fourth day of unpaid leave pending payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the employer's special consent, the sick worker will lose his or her salary in four days, equal to at least 15 per cent of his or her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to create a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, imposing one day on public servants without sickness benefit (public servants have not yet had to wait for the payment of the benefit, as opposed to a three-day waiting period for private sector employees).
Now that these issues are under discussion, the majority also rediscovers the subject of fraud in view of the abuse of hospital sheets.
Control will become more severe and, in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all the illegal payments you received," warned Xavier Bertrand on the RTL channel on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital sheets.
They have indeed been subject to constant control and political attacks since 2002 that bear fruit.
People in France are no more ill than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the national figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Foundation (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily compensation costs of Euro11.3 million in 2008 amounted to 5 per cent of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent related to maternity leave and accidents at work and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, which amounted to Euro6.2 million.
And therefore, it was 2.5 percent of health costs.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days on hospital in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group study.
The average arithmetic, which conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site showed that 75 percent of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day sick.
Another study, this time concerning health insurance, suggests that in 2010 37% of hospital patients lasted less than 8 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% longer.
Compared to European neighbours, it is evident that French workers are no more likely to take sick care than those of any other country.
A lengthy study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total absence rate in France (for health reasons or not) was 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The rate of fraud associated with hospital sheets is very low compared to grey employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has led to a systematic examination of the hospital's length of more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that 13% of 285,000 short-term sickness reports were “unjustified” or too long, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital sheets for more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were found to be “inappropriate or unsubstantiated”, which is 132,000.
Generally speaking, 166,000 cases were “unfounded” for several million employees who received hospital forms.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, grey jobs.
According to UMP member Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this matter, they amount to between Euro9 million and Euro15,000 million in uncollected revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation and is therefore infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Popedimos: Greece must follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Popedimos announced this to Parliament, adding that the 100 days allocated to his Government by the United Nations had not been sufficient to carry out this task.
"To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government, who made his first public statement, opening the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October should be the “main objective” of the new government, since the country's presence in the Eurozone was “at stake”, he added.
Therefore, the Popedomos forecasts a reduction in the country's budget deficit to "about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new government's actions
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support any further austerity measures.
"We won't vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of his party a new democracy.
He agreed with the goals of reducing debt and debt and fighting waste, but also with his rejection of any policy that prevented economic recovery.
Ollie Renu, the European commissioner responsible for economics and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary credit of 8,000 million euros without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with extraneous assistance, says the committee of experts
The Canadian is denied death, as stated in a report by the Royal Society of Canada.
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee argues that the government, health institutions and doctors are working together to provide the best palliative care, and this is not counting cancer cases.
Canteen refuses to die.
Only nine percent of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the findings of an admirable report by the Royal Canadian Society, which brought together six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee suggests that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow for extraneous suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is subject to circumstances and the patient may be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada is in number 10, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death”.
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports experts appointed by the Royal Canadian Society.
And 68.6 percent of them end up in hospital.
Québec has the highest rate in the country, where 86 percent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and extraneous suicide, the authors of the report concluded that it was contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which had already stated that it did not wish to change anything in the criminal code concerning euthanasia and extraneous suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminated, there is no evidence that this decrimination results in abuse of use, i.e. euthanasia or extraneous suicide against people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, at a teleconferencing conference, Jocelyn Downey, who submitted the report, confirmed most of these cases in countries where euthanasia and extraneous suicide were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is apparently illegal.
Suicide with extraneous assistance is practised in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia because, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey, they believe that this will help people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are of less value.
With regard to people who had assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of those interviewed believed that they should not be criminalized.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggested, among other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that legal termination of medical care was not an offence.
The Committee of Experts also requires health professionals to be trained in a spirit of respect for abandoning health care at the end of their lives without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the committee called on the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal session already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requires that it be used when it does not serve to suppress physical pain like euthanasia and is subject to the same limitations.
Comments by other experts
Some health law experts have already made comments on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, described the “extreme” position of the experts who signed the report as not limiting the use of euthanasia to death, among other things.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years of age can ask for help in committing suicide, says metre Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the independence of the individual above all other values that form the social fabric of society.
He said that "there are warning signs and bans in society."
The health law specialist, Margaret Somerville, also expressed “a categorical opposition to the findings of the report, which she referred to as the “manifest for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, challenges in particular the report concerning abuses in some countries where euthanasia and extraneous suicide have been legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls upon President Assad to yield to power
Damascus denies "conspiracy"
Syria Is Growing in Isolation
Bashar Assad's followers held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure increased on Syria, Bashar Assad, who, with Russia's support, resisted it and condemned the “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after Syria had been suspended from the League of Arab States, the European Union had tightened its sanctions against Damascus, and Syria's neighbours Turkey and Jordan had called for the dismissal of President Assad.
King Abdalla II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call upon President Bashar Assad to give way to Syria, where some forty more civilians and members of the regime's armed forces were killed.
"If Bashar had a dear interest in his country, he would have had to resign, but he would also have had to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life," said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ahmet Davutoglu, expressed his regret that Turkey's mediation efforts, which had begun earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who did not live in peace with their people and could not meet their aspirations would lose power, he said, in hindsight on Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey was taking an ever more severe course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “expanding of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasing turn towards repression in Syria, notes Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department.
Since then, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's armed forces have died in the Dar'a area of southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Watch (OSDH).
Two other people died during a shooting and shooting with heavy machine-guns in Jobar in the besieged town of Homs, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, said that the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
He had also reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to remove Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, believing that this plot against Syria would fail."
Following its decision to remove Syria from the League of Arab States, it is currently examining “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers to be deployed to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppe, also supported the dispatch of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime which he said had fallen into a "paranoia".
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled to take place tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the 2 November crisis recovery plan, which includes the withdrawal of armed forces from fighting towns and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the League of Arab States' decision “uncorrect”, while China called upon Syria to implement a plan to overcome the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from markets and Italian victims
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monty, asked the markets for a little time to form a team and execute a program that would require “victims” to restore credit capacity lost during the last few months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European commissioner yesterday participated in discussions with political parties before today's meeting with trade union and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet composed of technocrats who are not members of Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a multi-victim programme, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups participating in the discussions following a meeting with a candidate for the post of Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he would have waited to see if Mario Monty would have asked the Parliament to vote by Friday to make sure that the new government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with the presentation by Mr. Monty of a limited list of dozen or so Ministers to head of the country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty spoke yesterday about the nervousness of stock exchange and bond holders, asking them for time.
Under "democracy requires time to prepare the government and programme, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding."
His appointment as President was first approved by the markets, but concerns reappeared, particularly after the sudden fall of industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politics”.
He said that the new government would be in operation until 2013, the date of the next election.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of parliamentary confidence on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of European commissioner Ollie Ren stressed that "despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed."
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet the planned budget for 2013, despite the strict economy plan adopted in recent months, had demanded, inter alia, new and strict measures.
The Italian "boss boss" by Emma Marchegal, who would meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of a shortage."
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as European commissioner (1994-2004), represented the “myriad of the era” for Italy after 17 years of Berlusconism, a “professor” symbolizing “the challenge of seriousness” and “the other Italy” according to the authors of the novels.
The great unknown is the durability of his team.
President Napolitano would be pleased to avoid quick elections, as by April 2012 Italy must pay its public debt to the value of Euro200,000.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scholar Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a nuclear-usable detonator, confirmed on Monday by an American agency specializing in nuclear danger.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISISS) draws on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of this United Nations agency to identify the scientist.
Over the past week, the International Atomic Energy Agency has expressed its concern about the “probably military aspect” of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based largely on the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years, “since the 1960s, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of anti-explosion methods for the production of synthetic diamonds”.
In 1989 or 1991 he left the centre to set up a company that produces nano-malms in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then worked with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia
In its report, the International Atomic Energy Agency referred to “the apparent signs that Iran's development of the nuclear detonator system had contributed to the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technology well, but who had also informed the agency that he had been working most of his career on this technology as part of his home country's nuclear military programme”.
Anti-Moslem crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of violence based on race and religion declined slightly or remained unchanged during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, representing an increase of 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent decrease in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in attacks against Jews and a 14 per cent increase in the total number of crimes committed on religious grounds.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBl, rose very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After the fall in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is rising again, as highlighted by Human Rights First, "the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant," adds the organization in the official communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be treated as serious human rights abuses," added one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Lejandre.
"The American government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes."
Hate crimes in the federal law are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation today.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter microblog site changed the presentation of its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, making it look like Facebook.
The new "activity" tab and the other "name" allow you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other "witterers", the Internet users whose messages ("twitters") you monitor, and those who monitor yours.
This makes it possible to learn if they publish messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "at a low percentage of users in August" before being released on Monday, and announced to the AFP that it would be a Twitter press secret to Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as intuitively rather incomprehensible and as using rather vague terms (RT to intersect someone else's connection, #fullowfreeway to recommend tracking of other users), mostly by making fun of experienced users, opens itself to a wider audience, representing users of something more close to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the web users discussed this innovation using Twitter on the Internet.
"It's useless, obsessive and overreacting to Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter stream, written by @dannykronström.
Austria
Introduction to the Constitution of the “Golden Rule” Budget
The leadership of the large Union of Social Democratics and Christian Democratics, in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write down a budget “Gold Rule” in the constitution in order to reduce the budget gap and thus avoid a possible depreciation of Austria's public credit rating agencies (triple A).
Sociological Democratic chancellor Werner Faimann personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with an Austrian public debt of 746 percent, much higher than the top 60% threshold set by the Maastricht Agreement, but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay had fallen by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by three thousand million euros more each year, the Vice-Chancellor and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Christian Democratics, Michael Spindelegger, argued.
Thus, Austria is meeting the demand of the Eurozone Summit on 26 October in Brussels; the heads of State and Government have demanded a reduction in fiscal deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The order adopted by the Austrian government resembles the “German model” because Germany was the first European country to adopt this “rule”.
Until the year 2017, the State ' s structural budget gap should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of the gross domestic product (GNP) each year, and since 2017, the State ' s structural budget gap should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP in any year, and the land, like the communities, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to force public debt to fall below the 60% threshold set by the Maastricht Agreement by 20202021.
Yeshihiko Noda
threatens new monetary market intervention
Japan's Prime Minister, Yeshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would initiate new monetary market intervention if the yen's value continued to rise.
We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we consider the exchange rate of the yen to be excessive, Mr. Noda explained it to the Senator.
On Tuesday the yen grew to almost a historical point that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had set a new power record since 1945.
But ever since, the yen has grown constantly, driven by the purchases of the investor who perceives it as a shelter in these worrisome times of global economic collapse and debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, while the euro fell below the symbolic floor of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis, the dollar cost about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The increase in Japanese currency is damaging Japan's export because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese companies from abroad when converting to national currency.
Japan is fighting to rebuild itself after the earthquake and the 11 March earthquake which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east) and stressed that Mr. Noda feared that the yen would kill the delicate foetus of reconstruction.
The third largest economy in the world resumed its growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in the year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high yen price does not reflect Japan's fundamental economic performance.
Finance Minister Jun Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy manager of Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “the appropriate steps” to make it clear that no further relaxation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting in late October, the issuing organization increased by 5,000 million yen (47 million euros) the purchase of treasury bonds by raising to 55,000 million yen (519 million euros) the ceiling of the amounts it spends on the purchase of various financial instruments to satisfy the security market.
Eurozone
interest rate rises, stock exchange swings
European indices undermine the risk of debt crisis.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 percent and finished the bid at 3.064 points.
The DAX dropped by 0.4% in Kraft, while London dropped by 0.1%.
Due to the new difficulties in the payment of credit by countries in difficult circumstances in the eurozone, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"Affected investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection," explained Terry Pratt, an IG Markets institution-broker quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7% under the burden of new market doubt about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused on Europe, and the stock exchange will follow each other in a corridor of sharp change until the investor can confirm that the situation has stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, manager of the Ichioshi Investment Management Foundation
This return of concern for the future of the eurozone is striking at the single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its bottom in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, falling by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it fell after the conference of the chancellor's party, Angela Merkel HDZ, on Monday, at which a resolution was adopted, including the possibility for a difficult country to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher than 6%
Loans in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
On Tuesday morning, Italian 10-year-old bonds made a return of 6.85 percent, while Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2 percent.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the participants.
Mario Monty, head of the future of the Italian government, asked the time exchange to restore the situation in Italy under threat of paralysis under the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Popedimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the “main objective” of his government.
Spain was hit by markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between interest rates for Germany and Spain's ten-year debt reached a new historical peak.
Waiting for the eurozone's growth figures
France recorded an increase of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent due to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, rethinked the decline in the second quarter, with a fall of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnating.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first estimate for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new crisis.
Energy policy:
Facts must take precedence over dogmas
If there is a theme that cannot be decided upon after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is an energy policy.
Accessibility and the cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy tendency that election meetings become a reason to think about the share and place of nuclear power.
The dispute will not bear fruit unless all the economic, social and environmental implications of the options offered are examined.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
Now that we have 7,000 million people on the planet, population development will lead to a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is devoid of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to generate electricity continuously, without forgetting the critical need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, in order to combat climate imbalances, a subject that has disappeared from environmental debate.
The Fukushima crash doesn't change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision conditional on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear power, or of Switzerland, which aims to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, are only a few that are firmly pursuing their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one installation to its kit by resuming the construction of the station which was interrupted after the accident in Tri-Mile Island.
While the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
Berlin's choice will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in the energy intensity, compounded by the increased demand for imported gas, particularly from Russia, and a rise in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be visible.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European Turbine Champion, from which it receives 30 percent of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; hence CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65 percent and 50% higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the other hand, because of the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than the French households.
Since in a globalized economy, the price of energy is a key factor in the competitive position of the economy and is a key to the maintenance of industrial equipment on national soil, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will result in a great increase in the cost of electricity, which will make the beautiful statements about our country's new industrialization and the protection of our purchasing power illusory.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this kind of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country's energy policy has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 intermediates.
It is highly export-oriented and attracts an entire pool of specialized international small and medium-sized businesses and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France had decided to abandon nuclear power, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these companies and lose 6,000 million euros a year from the French export of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electric engineer would order an EPR calculated to work for sixty years if the manufacturer was scheduled to close down?
To solve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
Areva's development of low-carbon solutions, nuclear and renewable, shows that energy sources are mutually compatible.
For nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of safety is certainly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls over existing energy centers, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose skills are generally recognized, are filled with the same security obsession.
Over 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, occurred under normal conditions of use, but without any consequences for humans or the environment
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and the unforgivable human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural catastrophes of unprecedented force, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and of the cooperation between security agencies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, represents a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all the energy experts who want to build a reactor, stopping it in Flamanville will be a great gift to the Areva and EDF competitors, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration is a burden or a good thing for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various sources: the overload of police, judicial and administrative services, subject to the policy of numbers and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a “human rights State”.
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which came into the news when the Minister of the Interior (Liberation of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, stones and waiters."
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is much agreement between the right and the left on this issue.
On the right hand side, it was suggested by Jacquez Chirac, who stated in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed people will not become a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers” and on the left hand side by Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “can't accept the poor from all over the world”.
Difference in the level of generousness only
In 2005, fear of an invasion of the country by a Polish plumber was felt by both the left and the right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only the level of generousness they allow immigrants to show.
In his program, he confined himself to banalism, saying that "joint work will solve our immigration problem."
This notion of immigration as a burden and a problem may give an elective advantage, but it is very expensive.
As we are reminded by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that summarized recent data on immigration (Specific people: How migration has shaped our world and shaped our future, May 2011, University of Princeton, 352 s.), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive effects of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restriction of immigration reduces growth and reduces employment.
Immigrants' fears are based on the notion that they can replace local workers, especially low-skilled ones, by causing lower wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants complement much more than replace local labour by jobs for which local labour is scarce.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most skilled work in dynamic sectors where education is not about job offers.
A positive effect on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the overlap between local and immigrants has a positive effect on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows results in an increase of 0.6% to 0.9% in real long-term wages.
This is without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute to creating new ideas and economic growth (of the American Nobel Prize winners, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, while Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migration also generates net social security gains, giving an average of 1% of the total European budget.
The World Labour Organization, for example, estimates that in Germany an immigrants who have arrived at the age of 30 will, in their lifetime, generate a net revenue (profits minus costs) of an average Euro150,000.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his term, was about to get caught up in the missing growth points.
These teeth, which were used to frighten immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, yet to understand European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, by inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the twentieth century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and the colonels in Greece.
Some believed that for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies it was enough to vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's day, the Little One has known that this is due to the superficiality of thought.
A universal vote, though a requirement of democracy, is not a sufficient requirement and may even be a “tool of oppression”, as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vashro once said.
No, democracy requires much more -- public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political crisis and a democracy crisis.
In this respect, the palinosia of a truthful Greek referendum will have a double debugging effect, demonstrating both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted and that, in the view of many, Republican soldiers are now reaching the wrong direction.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart Blanche" for an absolute European monarch or jump with his legs tied to a hole in nationalism--what a choice for a citizen!
No, we dream not of a guillotine blade, but of a joint, clear and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and we don't know how many more crises there are, because there's only one crisis: the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is under the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffers from its weakness and from a lack of solidarity.
Europe is totally humiliated on the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of European sovereignty, but Europe is gradually losing its own sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
There is an urgent need to restore the administration of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because only by working together can Europeans reduce everyone's debt burden, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
A solution to the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy without bringing us to a catastrophe.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the socialists and by Jack Delore, everyone now demands a European economic government.
Let's say so.
But to imagine it without stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has been brought about by the countryside, is another madness and a new dead end.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to create a republican.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a united Europe at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, true national European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Uncontacted chip cards are spreading more and more.
The World Card Show opens on Tuesday in Wilpenth, near Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, the year 2011 will end with 11% growth in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards), exceeding 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important sector of unconnected technology is that pays for public transport or purchases by simply drawing a card over the reader.
This year, 460 million uncontacted chip cards will be sold in the world, compared to 320 million years ago!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected to 580 million units) and will amount to almost 10% of the world market for chip cards (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been behind Asia and the Pacific, is now making progress in the area of unattended payments.
About 26 million Visa cards have already been installed in this function and are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France begins with a more modest start, with 400,000 untouchable Visa cards in circulation.
But large shops are speeding up.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCards.
To move faster, banks need to provide equipment to their clients.
"The two large organizations in France promised to systematically disseminate to their clients bank cards designed for unattended use in the future," reported Gerard Nebuya, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the future payment, that is, a mobile phone.
So far, few machines have been equipped with the NFC (Communication of Nearfield) technology necessary to carry out such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they must really break up next year."
"We rely on the world sales of between 80 and 120 million units in 2012, "explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June of next year in Qana.
The iPhone equipment of some 200 clients and staff will be provided with cover that provides uncontacted payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also announced yesterday that he was preparing to launch a market offer that would allow his clients to pay through their mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spreading from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the Islamic Magribe's association with the Boko Haram sect.
The long-expected links between the Al-Qa'idah terrorist group in the Moslem Magribe (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram were confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Under-Secretary Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdudelkader Messahel, even said that Algerians were now confident of that.
"The help these two organizations use, and the secret service reports show that they are actively cooperating," he explained, without entering into the details.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French men in Niger in January revealed two links.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antwan de Léokur and Vincent Delori were apparently killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French special forces.
Among the wrecks left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several SIM cards belonging to the terrorists.
The Axis of Terror
An analysis of the calls that took place indicated several interviews in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one refers to a Nigerian who lived for a long time in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram's cradle, and the other to a man who is said to be close to Akmi and a sect.
"This is a step forward, but no doubt we have to wait for more reliable evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for many years that the sect has received external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active," said Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become more evident in Boko Haram's actions and statements and in its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and more sophisticated explosive devices of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community, led by Washington, now exerts pressure on the city to focus on the problems that Boko Haram is creating.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as a community of enlightened people of no interest.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maydiguri under the Moslem, School and Imam Foundationist Mohammed Youssouf, Boko Haram -- which means "Western education is sin" -- preaches the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Islamic north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It is politicized and requires strict observance of the sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central government.
It targets mostly churches, bars and governments.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
The Abuji response, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left behind 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and will go beyond its northern suburbs.
Last Christmas she took responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in Joss and then for another one in Ohio.
In June, Boko Haram launched the first suicide attack on a reinforced police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is coming from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a matter of concern to all security experts.
Now that Aqmi has grown stronger in Mali and the Niger, and Al-Khabab Somalis are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodluck, Alain Juppe warned Boko Haram of the danger and offered to share all available information.
Peace as seen by Republican Presidential candidates
With regard to China, Iran, and Israel's assistance to Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, and Rick Perry, they compete in the simplicity and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world with simple, or rather simplistic, ideas?
If you listen to Republican candidates for president, voters might believe it.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have been multiplying a loud but undefined statement on foreign policy, which has been a traditional strong part of the Republicans.
China, Iran and Israel are often mixed up in moorings.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of being promoted by the Good Party's Old Age, threatened to lodge a complaint with the Chinese at the World Trade Organization and to blame them for “manipulating his currency is a sensitive subject for America, irritated by the migration of its entire industry to Asia.
Worse still, if it leads to a trade war,' he said.
John Huntsman, former Obama's ambassador to China, and the only candidate who understands complex foreign policy, has failed to resist a position that encourages emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who keeps up at the bottom of the ratings, has not been heard.
In the style of a Regan.
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if the sanctions could not stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran," he announced.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of failing to honour his promises to that partner.
The businessman Herman Kane, the second in the candidate rating, demonstrated a discouraging lack of knowledge.
He had recently called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing was trying to achieve nuclear power -- apparently not knowing that China had it since 1964!
The governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes against Iran, says he's ready to use the US army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Cain, Perry, and the candidate Michel Bachman also recommend torture of suspected terrorist suspects prohibited by Obama in 2009.
All this is far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say that Regan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They remind us that Obama himself was a amateur and that he had to lower his tone in the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the untimely withdrawal of the children from Iraq, of his manoeuvres in Libya, which gave him the reputation of weak politics.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population views the positive balance of national security under Obama, which liquidated Ben-Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that binds itself in the sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to restore its leadership, Obama is right.
North Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas entering Europe.
The Northern Pipeline, connecting West Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is designed to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas manufacturer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pomp.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday in the Baltic coast, between the Orchestra and exquisite snacks, in the opening of the Northern Flow, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francis Fion and his Dutch colleague Martha Rütte together turned the symbolic valve controlling the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
Under the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million extra cubic metres of gas will flow to Western Europe every year on the first 1224 km pipeline connecting the Leningrad region to the land of Meklenburg-Mexia.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012 with a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to the total consumption of France.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met the fierce resistance of Poland and the Baltic States.
The Northern Flux will indeed allow gas to be transported directly to Germany by avoiding passing through a third country (Polish or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power, making it harder for them to influence Russia by threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the most stressful moment of Warsaw's debate, it did not stop before comparing the North Stream with the new German-Soviet pact, implying an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the matter is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security in its supply.
But the cost of Europe's energy loss is because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has achieved in less than five years an understanding of a direct union between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, which consumes large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are about to run out.
"This gas pipeline is part of Russia's cooperation, it's a new artery that organically binds us," said Francis Fion, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine pipe is made of concrete-based steel to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left since the Second World War.
"The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Mueller, spokesperson for the North Stream Company.
There was also a need to take many steps to protect fauna and flora.
Pipeline is a long metallic snake of weight equal to the weight of 242 Eiffel Towers, without ruptures all over its length, without fans or service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project manager gave it up because Sweden was not delighted that a Russian government company would permanently settle on its shores.
"In case of an accident, we'll shut down the gas flow in less than a minute," says Jens Mueller.
So if you leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But that seems unlikely to be the designer of the seams, designed to leak once every 100,000 years.
The state of the gas pipeline will be monitored by a submarine that pulls the ship, for external observation, as well as by a machine that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
A cigar-like machine is injected into a 1 metre-wide pipe and pushed forward with a gas stream.
Upon arrival after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate information about any metal deformation.
The pipe was designed for 50 years without the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is done only at the expense of its pressure.
It is 200 bars on departure and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom, who owns 51% of the capital, remains the leader.
The rest are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), the Dutch Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9 per cent each).
The five companies had established a joint venture called the North Stream, which had been entrusted with the construction and operation of a gas pipeline.
His head office is in Tsugu in Switzerland, where taxes are particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transport.
"Gasprom will pay for the full volume, no matter how much gas will actually be transported," says Jens Mueller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was secured by 30 per cent shareholders and 70 per cent by bank credit.
The total cost of the operation will be €7.4 million for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they'll pay for their costs because Gazprom takes on all risks.
The gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Ljubmin to a sandy shore planted with coniferous trees.
The vents are 4.5 meters high and form the outlet gas terminal.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into the German gas pipelines.
Last Tuesday, the terminal gets one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
On full power, it'll be 3 million an hour, and in 2012 it'll be 6 million.
Moleskine market notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will restore the taste of writing.
He's got a scent of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easy to recognize by the rectangular black cover, by the rubber, by the yellow and white pages, as if yellowed over time.
However, the notebook Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milaan, decided to launch design notebooks.
Mary Sebregondi, the company's then consultant, assumed responsibility for launching a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique, the moleskin, the lacquered cotton cloth used, for example, to cover the bench.
This type of notebook is said to be highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine brought into line with today's taste the old and forgotten thing that was cultivating for amateur artists before the twentieth century," said Mary Cebregondi, who had since become the managing brand at Modo Mode.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales rose by 25% to 12.7 million.
We've gone a long way from producing the first years when only 3000 notes were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to set the profile of a typical customer because the notebook attracts a businessman, a student, and a man of a free profession alike.
The customers of Moleskine are cosmopolitan, open-minded and educated.
A small Italian company that had at first only 12 employees now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributed her notebooks to Fnac bookshops, shops in small city centers and was able to gain wide visibility.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter, despite the advent of e-mail," explains Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; recently the brand has organized an exhibition called "The Circle Path", where architects and artists have shown their own notebooks.
In August he also launched the cover with a Leopard painting on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Using its successes and cultural auras, Moleskine has developed its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and brand includes all kinds of support.
A success that generated envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the SG Capital Europe Investment Foundation, now Syntegra Capital, who wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the rate of employment of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of disabled persons are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for disabled persons begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the rate of unemployed persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the population at large.
Disappointing?
"No," says Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for disabled persons.
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"The number of unemployed persons at that time was not two, but three times more."
"But there's still a lot of work to do."
It must be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for a disabled person.
Of these, 37% are older than 50 years of age (or 17% on average).
Rather, they have a low level of education: 80 per cent do not have a bachelor ' s degree, while of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85 per cent for disabled persons, compared to 38 per cent on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to get back to work and that are the core of the problem,” says Christian Grapen, Director General Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre Association on Cité ordered showed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge about disability and were "representing people who were in carts or mentally or mentally disabled".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6% disabled workers, as set out in a law passed in 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"Today we're about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Proof: the number of “obligated” organizations, like the amounts paid, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from 606 million to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which raised the tax, created a great deal of pressure on the company," Pierre Blanc explained.
"But this improvement also reflects a rise in consciousness, particularly in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness."
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday afternoon (20.45 a.m.) Eden Azar and Georges Lekens did not conceal the pleasure they had from this friendly match.
We won't get to say that there was a secret collusion between them, but the picture is symbolic.
At the scene of the Stade de France, Georges Lekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after his attacker's game against Turkey, a Belgian coach can only commend him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he's a Belgian."
"I want to go on," assures the player Lille.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and the team, it's one whole, it justifies him.
"I'm in Lille all year, and I'm not in Belgium."
"I have to earn glasses."
Left in reserve, in anticipation of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to St. Denis to finally "greeze."
Without forgetting the notion of pleasure, however.
It has supported the Blues since the age of 7 and the 1998 and 2000 victory campaigns.
"I have always supported them, he acknowledges.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this match.
And especially that on the other side are Mathieu (Debushi), Johan (Cabe) and Adil (Rami),' he recounted.
"Just our roads crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Lekens kindly remembered "hotness."
"Perfect" to play the holiday match.
"Greatness" also claims that France's "returned to a very high-level team" just a year after the NYR accident.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, admired him.
Now that Belgium misses the next European, a technical sportsman will fly in a blue-headed plane... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll find out in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident
Portugal Paulo Bento starts his match against Bosnia on Tuesday in Lisbon with a great deal of hope.
Both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality on their way to him.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt that the Congregation, which he has been in control of since September 2010, has been classified as the Euro of 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a match to play and Bosnia to win.
With 0-0 on Friday in Zenica's hell, it's clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal had dominated the match for more than an hour, it had not been able to achieve the desired goal that would calm her down.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk."
But at their brightly lit de la Lus Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of a public that should be excited, though the match will be very tense,' said the optimistic but thoughtful Bent.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50 percent chance of getting to Europe 2012," said Carlos Keiros' successor.
On Friday, a match against Bosnia requires the Portuguese to win.
No one could have arranged Bosniacs.
"It's a good result which, however, has some risk," lamented Bent.
"We'll be playing against a team that has a lot of technical merit and has many individual merites," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on Bosniacs from the beginning, "no time to think."
It's a good idea to be realistic this time.
