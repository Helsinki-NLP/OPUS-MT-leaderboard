From my point of view, the literature program was formed by women of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevski and Volgonski.
They were writing the bellelets, of course, from the point of view of those Balzac-age ladies.
And psychology and the torment of Tolstoy and Turgenev's heroes are not so interesting for teenagers.
Young people are rarely interested in hero psychology.
Thank you very, very much.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Micropackage Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different rigidities: the medium-hard surface is made of latex coconut fiber and natural latex, and the moderately soft surface of natural latex.
A spring block of 1,000 springs per square metre is rapidly adapted to the body of the sleeping one, warning that the effect of a "wave" or "gamac" will occur.
One of the values of the model is to distinguish the breathing materials.
The latex, perforated for air-tightness, is perfectly ventilated naturally, as is the coconut carpet.
This keeps a healthy microclimate of the bed.
The mattress is also subject to an extended guarantee period.
The official warranty from the manufacturer is five years, and the life of the mattress is longer.
The protection against dust and pollution is entrusted to a removable jaccard cover supplied in a package.
If you buy an orthopedic pillow into a mattress, it's recommended to keep your spine at the best during your sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - the coconut provides an anatomical back support, the latex relaxes the muscles.
Turn your brain on and chase such cousins!
It's better not to have anything like that.
Either look for an outside driver or someone who's willing to invest and work with you as a share.
If it doesn't work, sell the car, even if it's a loss, don't be sorry.

Andrej, you've been told that there are retired schoolmates who won't be working in the team line.
The computer teacher won't be able to help either, he hasn't been trained, the school's playing video games.
So there's no support.
With horror I remember these dinners and guests at my parents' house.
The guests are on the doorstep, and the cookies are still on the stove, and the mother is polishing the floor.
Oh, my God, I've had enough to eat.
And then we'll wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you carry food, two days cooking, day cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They're fine, and they're sure to have cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I'll cover the table in a minimime.
And I make them delicious things, and I bake them all the time for nothing.
Germany: A fourth inoculation against the coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth will take summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current inoculation in Germany will not be final, but will continue with a new force.
Despite an active immunisation campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus will probably not be enough to fully protect it.
The head of the Ullrich Weigoldt Association of General Practice doctors is convinced of this.
This is reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
"We expect the fourth inoculation to take place in the summer, no later in the fall," the expert suggests.
In addition, Weigoldt hopes that the fourth Coronauvirus Immunization can be carried out "in combination with the flu."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced immunisation can help to combat the spread of the new strain of the Omicron coronavirus.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
So the probability of re-infecting Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is reflected in the results of a preliminary study carried out in South Africa.
On this basis, BioNetech/Pfizer growers plan to provide an Omikron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
The companies stress that the two doses of the vaccine do not offer sufficient protection against infection with the new version of the Omicron Coronavirus.
A study by BioNetech and Pfizer found that at two doses of the vaccine, the efficiency is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential decreases by more than 25 times."
"This suggests that two BNT162b2 dosages do not offer sufficient protection against omicron-stamp infection," stressed BioNTech and Pfizer.
So we need a third dosage.
The experts are insisting on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the president of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of reducing the interval between second and third inoculations.
Moreover, according to the Salzberger, accelerated immunisation will affect both the spread of the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel shows it very strongly," underlined the expert.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from the many other Vibs by what was originally designed to be used for ice fishing rather than just for fishing.
These whiskeys have more weight than the sized analogues, which certainly has a positive effect on the nuances of applying these interesting baits.
Another recognized feature is the top fin of solid and robust plastic, creating additional vibrations with vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter excuse" catcher, Bet-A-Vib shows a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy thing is a simple monotone animation, that is, the movement of the walker up and down is almost without pausing.
In planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient for catching in a limited space, overwhelmed by underwater plantations, roots and other obstacles beyond which a chain can be attached.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant in catching a sea-skin and a large-skin, especially in the middle of winter, when a point-and-aggressive bait is required.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib immediately unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib has also been used successfully for winter pond catches.
To satisfy its humour, two modifications can be made: with or without a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or SL - Silent.
It has also been pointed out that the Bet-A-Vib game has the potential to irritate a passive squirrel that doesn't even react to a living person.
When caught, Bet-A-Vib shows range and accuracy.
This bulwark is understood, and is not preposterous, and is well aligned with the floss and braided cords of even large diameters.
For catching squirrel, squirrel, squirrel, or squirrel, except evenly relevant, and "stroke," sometimes with a squirrel down the floor.
If you are caught in industrious places, you can switch the front triangle to the double, which reduces the probability of a lead.
Among the baits of his class Bet-A-Vib is one of the most sustainable in work and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With the same success, it can be used in relatively small and rather deep areas.
All models are fitted with the Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian Mercenaries were declared
There are more than 7,000 private military companies in Libya, Vagner.
This was announced on Sunday, 12 December, by the President of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled Al-Mishri.
"There are currently more than 7,000 Blacksmiths in Libya, Vagner.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Coofra.
They have 30 jet planes on the Gardabia airbases (also used as a civil airport in Sirte),” he quoted by Anadolu.
Khaled Al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries were trying to “take” a central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after “taking their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Save Presence
According to the interviewer, Moscow was searching for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “placed itself in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, as reported by the agency.
The Russian authorities have officially denied that the Kremlin has the support of Vagner.
Where else might be the Mercenaries
According to the agency, Wagner is believed to be active in nine countries in Africa: the CAR, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection to leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Vagnera's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of arms, technology and military services to these countries,” the article states.
According to the media, the Hungarians allegedly fought in Donbasa, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in the police force or in the lawn register, and its combatants are not listed on the uniformed lists.
This company is under US sanctions.
Remember, earlier 27 EU countries had approved a restraction against Vagner.
The EU Council is expected to adopt this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Libyan Supreme State Council is de facto the second House of Parliament with advisory functions to the dominant Islamists, as written by the TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the election of MPs and Head of State from 24 December at least to February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will pass on time are rapidly decreasing," notes the material.
Against this background, the Libyan High Election Commission postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates and broadcasts Sky News Araba.
External politics with Russian eyes
Thirty-eight percent of Russians have seen more success in a country's foreign policy than failure, while 29 percent believe that failure predominates.
"Examples of success--"in Syria protected, restored peace there," "the North Stream-2 decision," "the whole world frightened that cool weaponry," "The Crime We Reject."
The main failures are "Conflict with Ukraine," "Confront with Western countries," "isolation from the world," says the Public Opinion Foundation study.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned the paper business -- all government services have become digital as well.
The Government of Dubai reported a complete phase-out of paper management and a transition to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided to the public in electronic form only.
This is reported by the Emirat news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new digitalization phase of all aspects of Dubai's life -- we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," said the Crown Prince of the Emirate on Saturday, President of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheik Hamdan bin Muhammad bin Rashid Al Maktum.
Internal and external documentation in all Dubai institutions will now only be digitalized through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health, LAC, police, municipal authorities, courts etc. Many commercial entities have also joined the Government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of documentation began in Dubai in 2018.
During that time, the authorities estimated that 336 million paper sheets had been saved, representing 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobian stated that electronic services save citizens two days a year.

Turkish car production and export fell below 2020
The production and export of Turkish cars declined sharply in November, owing to the depreciation of lira.
As a result, industry performance for 11 months was worse than last year, reports Bloomberg, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were manufactured in Turkey in November, 20 per cent less than the previous year.
Some 75.9 thousand cars have been exported, more than 25% below last year ' s value.
And while Turkey's car sector has shown positive performance by the previous year in the first 10 months of this year, it's already turned out to be 0.3% worse than last year's car output in the 11 months of 2021.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November divided by 29% in relation to the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 entities received a loan deferral in 2021
The first Vice-Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, spoke about the situation with regard to the granting of small and medium-sized business benefits, and sent to MIA's correspondent, Cazinform.
“In accordance with the information provided by the Financial Market Management and Development Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, in accordance with the instructions of the Head of State dated 1 April 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 of 9 April 2021 on the approval of the procedure for the granting of deferred payments for small and medium-sized business entities,” Alihan Smailov wrote in his reply to the parliamentary request.
He recalled that the deferral of loan payments by banks and organizations engaged in micro-financing activities provided for the deferral of payments on credit issued by 1 April 2021 to entities of the HCM, including PPIs, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the subject of the HCM.
The borrower's application may have specified a different deferral period.
During the period of deferral, the lender's claim work, notice of the need to pay outstanding debts and the commission's payment and other payments were suspended,” the vice-premier remarked.
In 2021, second-level banks received applications for loan deferrals for 603 BMS borrowers, of which 553 BMS entities received a deferral of 9.7 billion tenge.
The IFR has applied for a deferral of 131 UXO entities, of which 95 entities have been granted a deferral of 105.8 million tenge,” concluded A. Smailov.
Purasev's pulmonologist suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the ocmiron strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can carry it easier than those with a strong body protection reaction.
Pulmonologist Sergei Purasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "ocmiron" might prove dangerous.
It's worth looking for when the virus is born.
Scientists believe that the "ocmiron" was born in a body that is infected with HIV or that suffers from immuno-deficiency.
I mean, when he mutated, he didn't encounter any resistance to immunity.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because of the lack of an answer to the immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, he's got these spikes, spikes, maybe more than proper, their antibodies not cut during mutations, commenting the pulmonologist Sergei Purasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can carry the "ocmiron" more easily than those with a strong protection reaction from the body.
Turns out the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens in pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-olds die, and 60-year-olds don't get it.
The young man's immune response is rabid, and it's completely inappropriate: where he can only threaten with his finger, he hits like with a sparrow's cannon, he concluded Sergei Purasev.
The doctor also mentioned that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant is pneumonia.
Inflamed lungs can be biological and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, the second is often the only one that can be bought is the symptoms, the whole hope of the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body -- temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then they have respiratory symptoms: difficult breathing, a sobbing, coughing.
Pains on the right or on the left, abdominal pains can also indicate a growing problem.
Meanwhile, Russia may begin to immunize a growing generation between 12 and 18 years by the end of the year.
The virusologist, the head of the IFTY genomic engineering lab, Pavel Wolczkov, said that this category is highly affected by coves.
Young people who go to school have as many contacts as possible.
It's the most active layer, as well as the children of day-care schools -- said "Moscow 24" by Pavel Wolczkov, a virologist, head of the IFTI genomic engineering lab.
Greatest thanks to the author for this article.
It's a pleasure to refresh the memories...
Teath-In.
In those distant 70s and 80s, no danceground was without the tunes of this group.
And at home, they were going to dance with their friends.
Immunologists have suggested a hypothesis why obese people become victims of coves.
The authors examined the fat tissue remaining from the bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipose cells could become coronavirus.
Immune cells located in fatty tissue, macrophages, have also become infectious, with a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who died of covid and found particles of coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid a response to the immune system.
It's probably also possible for SARS-COV-2.
Biologist explained the causes of dementia
A bioscientific candidate, Simeon Goloshakin, mentioned the causes of dementia and how it was prevented in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, over 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome shows the gradually loss of cognitive functions, and over time it is difficult to guide a person even in a familiar environment.
Holoshakin observed that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerational disturbances, head injuries, some infection, metabolic disturbances and a shortage of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
This includes hypertension, diabetic, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity can play a role," he said.
Dementia is also affected by addictions such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorder and low-moving behaviour.
Among the first signs, the expert pointed to forgetfulness, failure to concentrate and a decline in abstract thinking.
"There's a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early occurrence of the ATS disease and a risk factor for it," added the biologist.
In order to prevent the occurrence of a disease, WHO recommends that the necessary level of phystrophy be maintained, that cognitive skills be trained and that memory and logic be involved.
Former professor at the Department of Neuroscience, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the FGAOW RINIM.
N.I. Bogolova, head of the Cognitive Disorders Department of the Federal Centre for the Brain and Neuro-Technology, Anna Boholepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned some 30,000 illegal artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has succeeded in returning some 30,000 artifacts that have been smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, 11 December, Al-Hayat was broadcast by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Shaaban Abdus Abdus Gouad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has recovered 22,300 artifacts.
Only this year, the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. discovered 2,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization," he said.
Abd al-Ghuad specified that all artifacts smuggled out of the country were registered in the archives.
The department is now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, professionals “trace auctions around the world and Internet sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural values were restored upon return and then displayed in museums.
He said that one of the recovered artifacts was the ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities requested Interpol to help find Pharaoh Tutanchamon's bench sold at an auction in London.
On July 4, the Christian's Auktion House held tenders where a bench over 3000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million roubles).
This caused Egypt's discontent.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanchamon, represented by the sun god of Amon, was stored in a private collection and has not been traded since 1985.
The way in which the relic came to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has in recent years actively sought to repatriate antiquities that have been smuggled out of the country at various times.
According to the authorities, 95 percent of smuggled antiquities are the result of archeological searches of black diggers.
"The Crimean Tatars are not counted" -- and that's right, because Crimean Tatars (232,000) are independent people (near the Turks).
If you want to add more, only 42,000 people -- so many Tatar (Jewish) live in Crimea (see the census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people is composed of two words!
Only the Turkish language group combines them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal employees' mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writing Financial Times.
In Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communications devices instead of offering a discount for the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications partner.
By current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees as they are used to handle business matters with colleagues or clients.
The bank exercises the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if the employee used it to meet a client that was not approved by the Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have gone to remote working conditions, the bank wants to extend this rule to all the devices that have been used to solve the working issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a time limit within which staff members can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, the Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
Sergei Jesenin's last year of life, the 1925th, was productive in creativity, but most difficult for the Earth's poet and his "ego."
He's already outside any literary association, he's broken up with imaginism, he's on his own, but he's famous, demanded, and sometimes he's heavily insulted by critics, even angry, but the reader is willing to wear it on his hands.
Over 60 poems have been written in a year, many of them are masterpieces, the "Persidian motivations" cycle has been completed, and the poem "Anna Sneguina" has been published, and 8 books have been published, and the "Soviet's Pink" book has been published.
And the main success is that at the end of June 25th, the State party concluded a contract with Jesenin to publish his writings in three volumes.
None of the modern-day Sergey Alexandericz poets have had such a honour; he is the first!
Besides, it was a very good money -- the contract fee was 1,000 roubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 roubles per month, the engineer 200).
The funds that year were needed more than ever.
Jesenin married the granddaughter of Tolstoy Tolstoy's Lion, who had to set up a family home, to support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
Life seemed to have been built up, something to be excited about, but for him it was mostly a dark tone, as if a nightmare had materialized from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Jesenin's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very ill.
I don't know where that pain came from.
Is the wind fluttering
Over an empty and deserted field,
Or, like a grove in September,
It's brainwashing the liquor.
Many acquaintances pointed out that Jesenin had given up heavily, looked ill, apparently ill.
There are more and more games, more nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis of alcoholism was ever submitted to Sergei Aleksandrwitz, there were no valid documents left.
Let's say, in May 1923, when Jesenin, at the insistence of her fourth wife, Americans Icedore Duncan restored their health at the Paris hospital at Professor Petra Gunnushkin's (repeated by Jesenin two years later, already in Moscow).
And here's the evidence of poets singing, scandals on this ground, police arresting -- dozens of memoirs scattered.
Since the beginning of the 20s, a terrible novel of a poet with a green serpent has been evolving rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Jesenin settled for a short time with a friend named Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Jesenin, with his very good income, had never had his dwelling either in Moscow or in Peter, found him in rented apartments, in hotels or in acquaintances.
Elders remember:
"He only came to sleep, and most of the time in a crazy, drunk state.
One day, returning at 4 a.m., Jesenin fell on the staircase...
Falling, scratched his face and shrieked.
When he recovered a little, he coughed constantly, spattering all over the sheet with blood."
And Jesenin himself, after his trip to Europe and the United States (there was a dry law at the time, but Duncan took along a decent supply of liquor) admitted:
"I haven't seen anything but courgettes and streets...
I'm at the end and people have stopped remembering...
Well, I've been drinking, of course...
And I drank because I was bored."

Promtex-Orient 100x195 Duet Latex Econom
The "Promptex-Orient Duet Latex Econom" is a modern budget model in a prize-class ruler.
The base of the mattress is the block of independent double springs.
A softer spring of small size has been inserted inside the large spring.
This allows for a uniform distribution of the load on the mattress.
On both sides the mattress is filled with artificial latex.
It's the analogue of natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and persuasiveness of this material increases the comforting effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergeen, it doesn't absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress will suit a pair with a large weight difference (of 30 kilograms).
Thanks to smart springs, there's no wave effect when a lighter partner rolls onto the heavy side.

He's almost 16 now, and he hasn't had a hard time wanting to fool around.
All the energy is directed at choosing what he'll earn for his life.
He's much more responsible than I was when I was his age or my husband, who had a problem with the law until the wedding.
A father takes care of his young daughter.
And she likes, as the Lermonts wrote, "wretched love."
Why did the girl cry at the exam before she failed?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't school?
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
He will.

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that Belarus uses immigrants as a “arms” against the EU
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that Belarus uses immigrants as a “arms”
The Polish Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Pavel Yablonski, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as a “arms” against the European Union and intended to return to such an “operation” next year.
In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement.
According to Jablonski, the sanctions against Belarus were temporarily “stopped by Lukashenko,” but he is“ actively searching for new ways”.
A Polish official is also confident that illegal immigrants will now be used as weapons “in many places in the world”.
As KP.ru wrote, the European Union had previously introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It addressed 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their readiness to further expand the restrictive measures against the Republic “unless the situation in the country improves”.
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not on the Sunday hat," when a velvet jacket makes a man laugh
The world-wide events of 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first person to announce his new fashionable solution was Daniel Craig.
As early as September, at the premiere of "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet robin jacket and a traditional Bondian butterfly.
He was followed twice by Prince William, who first put on the Eco-Price ceremony with an unmatched royal dress code green velvet jacket, and then picked a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charity Foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, the trends were applied to themselves and to Lionel the Messianic.
The football player came to pick up the seventh golden ball in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same clothes.
AliExpress has already observed a growing demand for men's velvet jackets in Russia.
According to analytics at the Gaceta.Ru, they started to be bought 1.4 times more.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a cushion and a fixed silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, beard, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between 3,000 and 6,000 roubles, and men prefer to buy suits only, and they choose suits of velvet suits less.
It's not just online truthers who can buy them.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the suite, the velvet jackets this season are presented in almost all brands -- and Briony, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
Gucci is considered the most desirable model, in which it appeared at the premiere of the film "Gucci House" by a trader named Jared Letto.
By choosing expensive stamp jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
A special thread binding technology produces a dense cloth with a porous external texture and smooth interior.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but therefore serve less.
The fashionable expert Lamoda Ilja Wakhaskin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, it's not his model or phase, but his appropriateness.
"Barhat requires evening light, so this jacket is perfect if you're going to a party or a solemn event," explained Wahoshkin. "It'll suit if the invitation contains the Black Tie or Creative Black Tie dress code.
Another important factor that allows a choice to be made in favour of a velvet jacket is the status of the purchaser.
"The man in the velvet jacket should first have the right advanced party with the means," say the Telegram-canal on the male fashion "The Belle Bramell." "The owner of the velvet jackets is usually a caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They're just invited to side-events where the dress code is always shown.
Ilya Wahoshkin suggests that a velvet jacket be combined with the same beautiful things: classic trousers with arrows, single-toned shirts, silk ties, loafers with brushes, pins.
Too simple and everyday things would look inappropriate.
The fashionable experts from Brambell's Belle are sure that it would be inappropriate to have a private employee in a velvet jacket at the company, and if it's "the manager of the company is a "yes," that's the subject.
If the employee is lower in rank and the goal is to move up in the complex hierarchy of the company or to get financial bonuses, it is best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The guide will certainly appreciate it with the phrase "not on the Sunday hat," the Telegram editors think about the men's fashion.
There's a very mixed sense of voice.
It's an unnatural tembre, it's so exhausting.
And it's not associated with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart, good luck in life!
It's about money -- alternative energy is a good lobby, that is, it's paying.
Billion investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy, too, is not about gas, oil, and coal being bought cheaper than they are now selling.
There's a wild demand for fuel.
The penny's digging.
Then who's out there?
As usual, a private customer.
Do Indian problems affect the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be treated as idiots who have lost the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good payday.
I didn't see any pretty people in the picture.
It's just mediocre within average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so confident of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole wagon, they won't be able to fit it, probably.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautifuls" but not because of their appearance.
Kazakhstanbeck, "a slave aware of his slave position and struggling against it is a revolutionist.
A slave who is not aware of his enslavement and lives in a silent, unconscious and speechless slave life is merely a slave.
A slave whose spear is flowing when he self-consciously describes the pleasures of a slave's life and is admired by a good and good master, eats a chorope, hum."
The immunologist said that rehab in 4 to 5 months would help protect himself from the strain of the "omicron" coronavirus.
Reacting in four or five months can protect you from a new strain of coronavirus infection.
This statement was made by the immunologist Nikolai Kruchkow, who called the inoculation six months later, given the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period."
"In previous strains, this period was normal, but now it's best to do the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four," the expert said, calling for a rehab campaign.
Hookoff also pointed out that early re-accination provides a good antibodies tetrater.
"If a person was immunized by two shots and a bouster, or if he was sick and immunized, or immunized and sick, he was given "hybrid immunity," i.e. antibodies are good enough, and neutralizing enough," the expert explained.
The Greater Seven warned Russia of “wide-scale consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The countries of the G7 (Germany, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom) published a statement following the meeting of the heads of the MFA in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's “war aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost a great deal” Moscow, but the specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the European Union are united in our condemnation of the build-up of Russian military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,” states the statement.
The Ministers further encourage Russia to “shadow the upheaval, use diplomatic channels, and abide by its international commitments to transparency of military activity,” as US President Biden spoke of during a video call to President Poetin of the Russian Federation on December 7.
“We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandian format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk Accords with a view to settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the G-7 also state.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in return,” they warn.
We reaffirm our unswerving commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's reserved position.
We will step up our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” the statement also states.
Earlier this afternoon, the head of British politics, Elizabeth Trass, said that Russia would suffer “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
She said that the meeting showed "the single voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that an invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia."
The Pfizer Vaccine was considered 32 times less effective from the omicron-stamp.
The efficiency of the Pfizer-BioNTech anti-coronauvirus omicron-stamp is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
This is the conclusion that researchers from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong have reached, and they have sent South China Morning Post (SCMP).
Vaccine was considered to be less effective on the basis of a study of anti-virus activity in citizens who received two doses of COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of anti-virus activity against the original version of Sars-Cov-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety," said Professor Malick Peerys.
However, researchers stressed that immunisation remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease from coronavirus infection.
Earlier, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the development of the Coronauvirus Pandemic in view of the impact of the Omicron-Tamma on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron-stam could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality unless additional measures were taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence accused the Fed of blocking the supply of military weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Resnikov, accused the government of former chancellor of the Federation of Arab States, Angela Merkel, of blocking the acquisition by Kiev of deadly weapons within the framework of the United Nations Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Resnikov mentioned that Germany had last month cast a vote on the purchase by Ukraine of anti-snippet systems and rifles to kill UAVs.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened its position on the rifles by considering them to be non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral arrangements with allies.
These include the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
The FT notes, however, that the position of the new German government under the leadership of chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains uncertain.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrew Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply arms to the Soltze chancellor.
He said that the previous leadership of the Federation had attributed its failure to provide arms to the risk of the military exacerbation of the conflict in Donbasa despite the Russian occupation of a part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "unlogical" position, I'm sure Germany will keep under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir of Zelenski announced that Kiev was awaiting assistance from Berlin in the equipment of the Navy.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected to be "a technical partner of Ukraine," added the President.
It was also pointed out that this spring, Robert Habek, the co-chair of the Green Party of Germany, had visited the Republic, where he had called for the sale of defence weapons to Kiev.

"Mercedes" protested against the result of the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi
The German Merdez team, whose pilot, Louis Hamilton, at the Abood Daby Grand Prix, finished the second time after the Red Bull driver, Max Ferstapin, protested the final result of the race, reports the press service for Formula One.
Merdez considers that the rules of Formula One 48.12 and 48.8 were broken during the course of the race.
In the first case, the German team challenged the judge's decision to return to the circle of leaders.
According to the second, Ferstoppen beat Hamilton to the "restaurant" zone.
Let's add that now the result of the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi, according to which Ferstoppen had ahead of Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the Formula One World Cup, is pre-emptive when the Mercedes protests are not known.
G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine
The G7 foreign ministers warned of the “serious consequences” for Russia if it continued its military aggression against Ukraine, as set out in the final statement of the parties.
The meeting also noted that it condemned the rise of Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
"There should be no doubt in Russia that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and costs," states a statement published on the British government's website.
The G7 Ministers and the EU High Representative have indicated that “joint in their condemnation of Russian armed agitation and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine”.
At a press conference in Liverpool, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Elizabeth Trace, warned of the "greater consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to give up its aggression against Ukraine," she said (TASS quote).
Earlier at the Liverpool Summit, the G7 Ministers for Foreign Affairs had agreed that the parties needed to return to the negotiation table to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.
It was a "Norman-style" negotiation.
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke for the dialogue on Ukraine in the “Norman-style” format.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Mary Zacharov, said that, in urging Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiation table, the G7 countries were “prescribed to be unable to take responsibility for their own mistakes”.

Discovered ways of returning stolen money from Internet stores
There are several ways to get back the money that was stolen online and not be the victim of future fraud.
They were discovered by information security experts in an interview with the RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of large losses when a bank card is placed in the hands of an intruder, it is recommended that a card or bank account that is not used for online shopping should be kept.
Part of the saving can be deposited into a saving account and recovered as necessary.
The experts also recommend that a separate card be set up for online purchases.
If the money was stolen from shops that do not use 3D Security protection technology, you can start a return procedure.
"Within the rules established by payment systems, unauthorised transactions carried out without the use of 3D Security, responsibility lies with the member in the payment chain who does not use this service," the representative of the Communications Bank clarified.
The expert from the Ecompay International Payment Provider, Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the purchaser had the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraud no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorizations, the transaction can be protested and recovered.
It is observed that, in some cases, the Internet stores themselves pay back to the client if the order has not yet been shipped.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, the Director of the League of Secure Internet, Catherine Mizulin, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud, from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data, had been received.
She said that creating a single window for online fraud complaints could be an effective solution under current circumstances.
Sholtz came to Poland to discuss the Northern Flow-2 and EU legislation
The newly elected German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, came to Warsaw to discuss the migration crisis at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judicial branch in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops at Ukraine's borders and the situation with the Russian Northern Flow-2 pipeline.
While Scholz has declared his desire to maintain a good relationship between Germany and Poland for years, the leaders of the two countries have expressed clear expectations from each other.
The Polish Prime Minister, Mateus Moravecki, said that he would encourage Sholtz to speak out against the Northern Flow-2, which is intended to bring Russian gas to Germany bypass Ukraine.
According to Moravecski, Russia can use a gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, for its part, supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of immigrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels solve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remained one of the reasons for the differences.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party “Right and Justice” were in breach of EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court held that national legislation took precedence over EU regulations.
The new German government, which was sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not make a public obligation to stop the Northflow 2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials said to the members that they had reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia were to invade Ukraine, a senior member of the United States Congress announced on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia would violate Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by the representatives of the G7.
Dimitri, look carefully.

And I know those apartments very well and I can see how they've been rescheduled.
Let's make sure they're okay.
It's always surprising when you write about the means to wash the sink, the toilet, the windows, the taps.
You have to wash them once a year for Easter.
Just don't let us get dirty.
The microphones want to give writers houses.
The future Russian Literator Support Foundation will be handed over by the State to the federal property that remains in the legacy of the Union of USSR Writers and the USSR Literary Foundation.
It's going to set up a writer's house, and it's going to be called the "Parliament's newspaper" in Mincifra, which will be the foundation's founder.
The Mincifreys are preparing a draft Presidential decree on the establishment of a Russian Literator Support Foundation.
The Explanatory Note specifies that the foundation will be responsible for, among other things, the targeted use and maintenance of buildings and structures once owned by the Soviet Union by writers and the Lit Foundation.
"The Russian Federation owned a large number of properties formerly owned by the USSR Literary Foundation, including those located in the town of writers of Transdequino, the village of Komarovo of Leningrad Oblast and others," reported the "Parliament newspaper" in the Mincifra press service.
The draft decree requires that the statute of the Foundation “create to encourage literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of the writers”.
“The creation of conditions for creative activity” means the creation, on the basis of transferred property in different parts of Russia, of written houses in which the conditions for creativity are comfortable,” explained in the Mincifras our publication.

Doctors warned of the risk of long-term use of blood-reducing drugs after COVID-19 and before immunisation
Doctors Irina Yartsev and Sergei Tocarev warned of the risk of uncontrollable use of bleeding drugs after having a coronavirus infection of COVID-19 and before being immunized against the coronavirus.
The doctor, immunologist Irina Yartsev, said that preventing the possible formation of clots after COVID-19 could cause a stroke.
Yartsev explained that blood products were not intended for everyone, except that if the patient was hospitalized, in hospital, he had problems.
The doctor assigns anticoagulants (blood-reluting drugs, prevents the over-producing of clots) on evidence.
She reported that there is now a blackout -- everyone drinks anticoagulants for a long time and then gets complicated by haemorrhagic strokes (bloody in the brain).
URFO's Chief Prophylaxis, researcher at the Society of Preventive Medicines, and Dr. Sergei Tocarev's Medical Sciences, in a conversation with URA.RU, said that Russians now often use anticoagulants before immunizing against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe in questionable advice on the Internet and begin to self-medicate.
There are citizens who, in the week before they were immunized, are beginning to take anticoagulants.
And in the pre-screening, doctors notice the bleeding.
He stressed that it was extremely dangerous to take any medication without knowing the cause of any symptom.
Potatoes were called super-food to protect against hypertension.
Research has shown that the regular use of this common and accessible vegetable has significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Potatoes are on every kitchen and have amazing properties.
Products are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that contribute to the work of internal bodies.
It helps with heart disease by improving blood flow and reducing cholesterol levels, reports the Semana Portal.
Today, heart disease is the main cause of early death.
To improve the situation, you need not only to be treated, but to be properly fed.
One of the helpers in this situation will be regular potatoes.
According to researchers, there are very many B1, B3, B6, and there are also very important vitamin C in this root.
In addition, potatoes contain phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and ribophlavin, folic acid and pantolean acid.
Micronutrients help to work effectively across the body's internal systems.
Among other things, the root is struggling with natural age impairments in the body, and it contains much useful cells for LCTs.
With regular consumption, it can become a preventative of atherosclerosis and hypertension.

The money we've got in the church wall will pay the plumbers $20,000.
The plumber who found the money in the church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will pay the reward.
This is reported in a press release by a non-profit organization, Krime Stoppers of Hoston.
The incident took place in a large Gospel church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preached, promising that godly Christians would enjoy prosperity and prosperity.
In November 2021, a plumber, Justin Cowley, renovated one of the church toilets and found thousands of packages of money and cheques in heat.
He handed over the discovery to the church and said he didn't even get any thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do," quotes KPRC-TV.
The discovery seems to be linked to a theft that took place at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques, which were stored in the church's safe, were lost.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any loss.
However, a reward of $25,000 was announced for information about criminals.
Justin Cowley could not claim that amount, as the reward had expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Creeme Stoppers of Houston, which had spent five thousand dollars on the prize and later received another 20,000 dollars in a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He'll get $20,000.
It was previously reported that the police had interrogated Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the Lakewood church wall.
Tanya, her words, her actions, that's her characterization of "like a real man."
That's why the attitude is so negative.
And it's not that "she's financially much richer than all writers," as they write here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves as insolently as this madam.

In Brazil, a judge of the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court (STF), Luis Robert Barros, ordered a covid passport from entering the State.
CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens who have anti-vaccination certificates are not allowed to be immunized.
Also on the list of exceptions are those who come from countries where the lack of a vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, Precarnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in the flow of tourists," said Barrose.
Earlier, Brazilian authorities had ordered unfeeling coronavirus-infected tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
Full protection scheme against COVID-19 solved
A virologist, a doctor of medical science, and a well-deserved Russian scientist, Anatoli Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
He said that this could be achieved by injecting and using a solo vaccine.
Internal use produces a large amount of immunoglobulin A. It does not occur with the introduction of an inoculation.
Immunoglobin A protects the slug, so the virus can't infiltrate the body.
And inside, we have the most immunoglobulins in our G (antityle).
And if you introduce both, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's no solution yet to double-vaccinate," said the doctor.
The Chief Prophylaxis of URFO, Dr. Sergei Tocarev of Medical Sciences, in turn stated that the main advantage of the use of inoculation together with the injective is to be able to stop being the bearer of COVID-19.
He added that this would help to ensure that, in such a case, the protection of the body was supposed to be maximized.
Earlier, the Nedgorod State Minister of Health, David Melik-Guseynov, said that a new upsurge of the COVID-19 epidemic would lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
He said that that was the case in other countries, where another wave of the pandemic had arrived earlier.
Inna, uh...
I've been talking to a dog (dead a long time ago) like this -- if you're willing to swap a warm house, a feeding, a loving, love, and a tether game, let's go.
But the peso was trained and smart.
He chose my society and went home.
A video method that works in 90% of cases.
Not from the ceiling, trust me.
I've slowed down a lot of owners so that they don't run after the dog, although they've got 200 grand running away, right by the hand, and they're taking it the other way.
So the "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog who ran out there.
In Europe, massive protests by opponents of immunisation continue
More than 40,000 demonstrators entered the streets in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make the cove immunisation mandatory.
From February next year, unfavorable people will have to pay a fine of Euro3 600.
The Spanish, outraged by the authorities' health policies, had held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some of them held posters saying, "It's a false pandemie," "I'm not going to immunize."
A major protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, cove-certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, nursing homes and night entertainment.
The decision to introduce health passports had been made by the authorities in several regions of the country, given the increasing number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then it turned into clashes with the guards of order.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials used water wells.

WHO has found “micron” in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strain of the coronavirus was already detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain can have devastating consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported by WHO.
According to the organization, as at 9 December, 63 countries had already detected strains in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has only been spreading since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the new version of the coronavirus.
WHO experts fear that a new strain based on pre-selection data may bypass the spread of the delta strains, which is the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all countries without exception.
Before that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Therros Adhanom Gebrayesus, had said that the omicron-stam could have a significant impact on the progress of the Coronauvirus Pandemic.
A similar conclusion was reached in the United Kingdom.
The experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the "omicron" will replace the "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is because the official "omicron" in the Kingdom is currently suffering from several hundred people, with an estimate of up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths due to an amicron strain, and at a peak, over 2,000 people will be transported daily to hospitals.
What the British health system will be unable to cope with.
The situation is compounded by the fact that according to recent studies the efficiency of the Pfizer-BioNTech anti-micronomial vaccine is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
The way the Russian "Satellite V" reacts to the "micron" is not known yet, which will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaley Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the omicoron strain.

Israel's Prime Minister Bennet reported that he had begun to immunize in schools
The Israeli Ministry of Health has been launching an emergency programme to increase the rate of vaccination since Sunday.
In the morning of December 12th, Coronavirus is immunized in schools all over Israel.
The Prime Minister of the Jewish State, Naftali Bennet, at today's cabinet meeting, said that the issue of the fourth dose of citizens at risk would also be examined.
In Israel, massive immunisation of the population against coronavirus infection of COVID-19 began on December 20, 2020.
The Israelis are inoculated with Pfizer.
Since 10 January last year, immunized people have begun to get a second dosis.
Vaccination of 12-15-year-olds in the country began in early June this year.
Currently, more than 5.78 million people have received both levels of immunisation, while the third has received more than 4.12 million citizens.

In Brazil, seven people died as a result of the heavy rain
At least seven people died and 175 suffered from heavy rains that struck the north-eastern state of Bahia and its neighbour, Minas Gerais.
This is reported to the TASS with a reference to rescue services.
At the border of these states, an extra-tropical Cyclone has been raging since midweek, bringing the region's precipitation rate to about 450 mm. In 25 cities in the state of Bahia, a state of emergency has been declared, some of which have become the most devastating flooding in 35 years.
The poem destroyed several bridges, two river dams, shutting down three tracks.
According to rescue workers, some 57 000 people had been homeless and another 67 000 had been forced to leave their homes.
More than 85,000 people in the region were affected by the disaster.

$135 billion went into applications -- Hi-Tech
In 2021, user costs in applications worldwide increased by 25% and downloads by 8%.
The world's most popular video services have been the most popular.
Most users downloaded the CapCut video editor and spent most on YouTube.
Both the downloads and user costs of applications showed a significant increase between January and November 2021.
Downloads increased by 8% to 140 billion. The cost of applications increased by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
This data was published by App Annie, an analytical company, which submitted a report on the market for mobile applications in 2021.
In 2021, the world economy emerged from the lounge and began a post-pandemic reconstruction.
"Will such a "return to physical" economy of applications slow down? None," the authors of the report believe.
India is the leader of the downloaded applications, accounting for about 20 percent of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets continued to spend more than users of Android: iOS represented 65% of all costs in applications.
Among the applications, the CapCut video editor was the top downloader in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian applications: a MX TakaTak video service and an application for the Mesho online trade.
The top 10 also includes Telegram.
In general, based on the number of downloads, VPN services (their top 10 two are VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and video production and broadcasting services (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, there are two other services, Moj and SnackVideo).
"Most users have spent in live broadcasts and online stripping applications," notes the report.
This is where YouTube leads, and the top-5 user costs also include TikTok, Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as a Japanese subscription service for Piccoma.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok are the first users to be active on a monthly basis, and the top-5 mobile version of Microsoft Office is locked.
In Russia, AliExpress was the leader in downloads in a year.
It's followed by a Zenly service that shows the location of friends, and yet the same CapCut.
The top 10 applications also include the StarMaker online caraoke, the Shein online dress striker, the Maps for Minecraft PE application, an online DiDiDiDi, an online taxi service, a YouTube Pure Tuber client, a Dixie retooler and a Samoan online store.
All over the world, people have adapted to the pandemic through the transition to life in Mobile, which is one of the main conclusions.
The sectors that have been most successful were those that have helped people get closer, both virtually and personally,” comments the report by the head of the Apple Annnie marketing research department, Lexi Sidow.
In 2021, the mobile game sector achieved $90 billion in revenue. By the number of downloads, the leaders were cosmos and hyperfosual games that had no or no story and video production was minimal.
Top three of the world's most popular games included Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DYY are leading games.
Earlier, App Annie had submitted its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of the following year, the company's analysts called the rise in the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the increase in popularity in the Z generation of financial applications, such as the Robinhood investor application, and the further increase in the popularity of metaversive mobile games.

Russians were warned of a new scheme of cheaters
The intruders began searching for new manoeuvres for video fraud.
It's written by "The News" with a reference to experts.
According to the Ivideon Director of Products, Zaur Aboulimov, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communications is the dolphins.
In this case, fraudsters are creating a fake video based on real recordings of the victim.
This enables neurosets to reproduce exactly the behavior of a person.
Aboulimov added that by using the dolphin, intruders could call the victim's acquaintance via video or create a video with a copy of the person to be sent for blackmail.
"Such forgery can easily trigger a bulling, as a backed-up intruder can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scrips," said the expert.
The leading systems engineer, Alexander Vetkoll, in turn, said that psychologically people have more confidence in others when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to technology using videos.
David, add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that all this was bought in a small town where the local mentality did not allow you to wear too much paint and walk in short skirts, to show stockings and panties on your legs.
It's a province, but the store had this kind of product.
In large cities, and Muslims, they painted and showed their knees.
So in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the Republic.
There's a lot of fashion, and there's no make-up.
Listed five actions that will help avoid sugar-diabetes
Problems with blood sugar are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and it is worthless.
Diabetes can lead to serious problems and even death over time.
Preventative activities play a key role in preventing the generation of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend a change in drinking habits -- a reduction in the quantity of various drinks and a shift to regular water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods increase blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when over-used.
So the first step in a healthy way of life is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
The disease is affected not only by malnourished diet but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, much movement is needed.
Professionals advise you to keep low-carbon diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but will also protect against sudden variations in sugar levels.
Many cellular cells are needed to protect against diabetic.
The food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to a sense of saturation, digestive juices and increased eating.

Dr. Pavlov told me about the "day-breaking migraine" in the workaholics.
Several factors can lead to a decline in health on weekends
The reason for the decline in health after working hours is often the “migranity of the day off”, explained by a well-known doctor, a doctor in medical science, a senior researcher at the Faculty of Basic Medicine of the MGU, and the researcher at the Zuhra Pavlov System Medical Center in his telegram channel.
She said that workaholics, who suffer from headaches, breakdown and weakness during the weekend, are particularly affected.
Dr. Pavlova pointed out that, in addition to the accumulated fatigue of the week, there are quite many objective reasons why the body reacts negatively to changing conditions.
On weekends, our lives are changing radically.
"We sleep long, we lie all day on the couch, we probably eat more, and we drink less," the doctor argued.
Because of overeating and lack of water, it's heavy and broken."
Late recovery plays an additional role.
So if you get up three hours later than usual, you get a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travellers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factor plays a decisive role in the decline of health, Pavlov recommended that we make sure that the most important factor changes during the weekend.

South African researchers have reported low performance of Pfizer's anti-omicron vaccine.
In South Africa, Pfizer's anti-omicron vaccine was reported to be low.
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa have carried out research and reported that Pfizer's vaccine against the omicron-stamp of coronavirus infection is low.
It is estimated to be 22.5 per cent effective against infection with symptoms, and therefore ... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned, according to a study published on the MedRxiv Portal.
In addition, experts explained that the drug could save the disease from a severe current.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the omicron-stam of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of a more frequent hospitalized crisis in the UK than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars are there in common foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutritious nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to Type 2 Diabetes as well as to cardiovascular and cancer diseases.
Users should take into account that an unknown word in the product may indicate hidden sugar, a component similar to sugar in calorie, composition and glycemic index.
There are several dozen names on the label that actually indicate sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fruit.
There may also be other dried sugars, such as dextrose (sugar from corn), left-hand sugar, melassa (black stream), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which are mono- and dysaxarides, and they can be not only in baking, but also in ketchup, doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and to the many different names of sugar.
Various sugars are different in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the product's composition - syrup or nectar, processed or untreated, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is difficult to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is not only the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruit, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be much higher than the label.
German chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance to the German Federation in 25 years
The new German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said that gas imports were losing importance to Germany, as the country continued to decolonize the economy.
He said that Germany intended to completely phase out gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years, the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the chancellor.
Scholz said that Germany remained committed to Ukraine's transport of Russian natural gas in the future, as that resource was now important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement expressing Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation.
Previously, the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annalen Berbock, stated that the Northern Flow 2 gas pipeline certification process was ongoing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of the coalition talks and the negotiation of a coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The PhD also indicated that the pipeline is not "compliant" with the EU.

The hackers hacked the Indian Prime Minister's Twitter
The hackers hacked the Indian Prime Minister's Twitter account, Narendra Modi.
The intruders were able to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment and that it had already bought the cryptovalite.
Modi's office has been asked to ignore new messages.
The premier said that Twitter reacted quickly, and access to the account was restored.
India's premiere's page was already hacked in 2020 and was called upon to contribute to the foundation with a cryptovalite.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted in a referendum against the independence of their Territory.
However, the level of participation in this third vote was considerably lower than in the previous two.
Preliminary results published by the local authorities indicated that 3.51 per cent (2,755 persons) of New Caledonia voted for their independence from France, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians voting.
As France-Presse comments, "the source of these elections has left no room for doubt," as the advocates of independence called on voters not to vote.
As the launchers of the referendum, they opposed the holding of the referendum on 12 December, considering that the new explosion of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevented a full and fair election campaign.
Thus, this failure paved the way for the third victory of French New Caledonian advocates, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, while in 2020, 53.3 per cent voted against independence.
According to the separatists, they did not accept the results of the last vote and would challenge them at the UN.
On Sunday, December 12th, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, was reported to be expected to speak on the basis of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has greatly revived the recent Presidential campaign in France.
Several Presidential candidates have expressed their preference for the Territory to remain in France, as it is the "last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean".
"New Caledonia must always remain French," Eric Zemmour repeated repeatedly.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate, Valery Pecress, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For its part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it's not his responsibility."
However, the President added, "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, has expressed “the strong wish that the choice of the Caledonians be France's choice”.
Light, oh, hi!
I'm a little... a little shy, still awkward, embarrassing.
Thank you for not turning your back on my channel.

Turkey experienced the world's first laser-armed UAV
Turkey has successfully tested the world's first laser-armed drone.
"Eren" was tested at a distance of 100 to 500 metres, reports "MlR24".
The machine is able to neutralize explosive objects at a distance with a laser.
The maximum flight height is 3000 m.
After the relevant tests, the UAVs must take over the arms of the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy the explosive devices without the use of deminers.
The Agency stresses that Turkey is among the six countries in the world that are able to develop and produce their own drones.

WSJ readers criticized an article about Russia's and U.S. relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell in which he described his vision for Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrificed Ukraine to Russia.
In his article he convinced readers of the danger coming from Moscow and allowed a series of insulting remarks to be made against Russian President Vladimir Poetin.
At the end of Hartwell called on the Western countries to "reveal a united front against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their opposition to the position of the American professor.
"There's quite a lot of false information in this article," quotes the RlA News comment by one of the readers.
"Europa is not ours to lose it," and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and the NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine's sake," said another.

An earthquake with a magnetoid of 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands region
An earthquake with a magnetoid of 5.2 occurred near Shikotan Island.
It is observed that the epicentre of the earthquake was 231.8 km north-east of the city of North Kurilsk.
The area was 92.5 km deep.
Previously, seismologists observed an earthquake of 7.5 in Peru, during which 10 people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing a new generation of rocket-propelled UAVs.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish factory, they will start to build a type ANKA rocket-propelled, unmanned aircraft.
This was reported on 11 December by the freelance adviser to the head of the Ukrainian President's office, Alexei Areszowicz.
So they're capable of acting against air objects, against other UAVs.
Even against airborne pilots.
They'll have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish airline: the hull and so forth," quotes the Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA's devices, he said that it was a jet rather than a piston.
He said it's a new generation of UAVs after Bayraktar, which exceeds it "by all characteristics."
The first batch of UAVs was to be produced by the factory at the end of the following year, and he concluded the arresting party.
The ANKA aircraft was set up by the Turkish Aeronautical Authority in February 2014.
The development of the UAV has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the day, Ukraine's General Command secreted data on the use of Bayraktar and Javelin rocket launchers during the military operations of the United forces in Donbasa.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, reported that a modern military drone factory had begun construction.
He said that Ukraine intended to use thedrones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence entered into an agreement to build a centre in Kiev, where they will train the staff and test and service the Turkish Bayraktar bomb.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum a "greater real step forward."
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport.
At Changi airport in Singapore, lions escaped.
This is reported by The Streets Times.
Two hunters managed to get out of the container with seven lions coming on one of the planes.
The publication notes that the country from which they were brought to Singapore and where they were going remains unknown.
One of the fugitives lay on the roof of the container.
The animals couldn't get away from it because of the nearby protection grid.
The opposition ended after the arrival at the airport of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which runs all the Singapore Zooes.
They have restrained the lions with a tranquilizer darts and are planning to take them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion had escaped from the landlord and had been pacing the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and the people were not injured.
Professionals warned of the risk of cancer due to the B9 vitamin
Research suggests that an excess of the B9 vitamin, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the publication of the Daily Press.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people without folic acid are less likely to suffer from certain types of cancer, particularly colorful cancer.
However, overdoses on the contrary contribute to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietologist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid used during the day.
The best dosage is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if it is significantly dissociated into a larger or smaller direction.
Kitchin recommends that tablets do not take Vitamin B9 without a doctor's advice, that dosage be monitored and that milk and other folic acid-containing foods be avoided.
Previously, a food consultant named Rachel Feyn called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is kept in avocados among other things, Feyn recommended that men eat it more frequently after 50 years.
In the United Kingdom, about 75,000 people could die by April due to an omicron-stamp.
Forecasts by British researchers indicate that the spread of the omicron-stam of the coronavirus in England may cause up to 75,000 deaths in the next five months, unless restrictions are tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, referring to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which was broadcast by TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of the British Cabinet's scientific and advisory emergency team, by April 2022 at least 25,000 deaths due to the omicron strain would be recorded in the country, while some 175,000 patients would be hospitalized.
At the height of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infections daily.
"Serious measures to control the coronavirus may be required to prevent the National Health Service from overloading if the omicron-stamp is more contagious than the delta option, and the existing vaccines will not be able to prevent infection," said Mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
The British Health Safety Authority had previously reported that, if the rate of octopus distribution remained at the current level, about 1 million cases would be detected by the end of the year.
By mid-December, however, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, there were 1,898 cases in the United Kingdom of OMicron-stam infection with coronavirus, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
However, on 9 December, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality, this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superpowers has grown in the world by a quarter.
This year's superboat construction and next year's orders are breaking all the world's record, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and to combat climate change.
In the world ship register, the number of boats ordered was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have a wish and money for a floating fortress of 50 million pounds or more will not decrease, writes the "Gardian."
However, there are more and more.
This year, 25 per cent more ships were ordered than the previous year.
Brokers say it's been 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a boat are afraid of land-based infection and prefer to run away from a pandemic on their own boat.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If all these people used to go to the office and meet with their business partners personally, now the absolute majority of them work remotely and are engaged in winter talks.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards take orders for new boats for 2025 and later.
This means that the customers are willing to pay more to make their boat ready for at least a year or two before.
"People just hunt for freedom, and super rich people could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this rich behavior and call it decency.
Rich people, say sociologists, don't want to realize that in times of lack of space travel, life on boats, or flying on their own planes, society is irritating because the elite doesn't want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
The economists call on governments to act and suggest that they introduce new taxes and rules for super-rich people, although they realize that it will be extremely difficult to implement with such a mobile money.
Meanwhile, only the number of super-yutes ordered is striking, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length greater than 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Requet is building a 180-metre-long REV Ocean yacht.
Once it's on the water, it'll be the biggest boat in the world.
The boat has a “summer pool” and a submarine designed to study sea depths.
On existing super-suits, it's commonplace to have a helipad, an open-air movie theater, and on some of them, such as a McGregor's boat, a platform for unification. Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at the University of the United States of America in Indiana, says that, compared to the total number of greenhouse gas choices, carbon footprints produced by super-rich ones are not significant.
But it's symbolic, given that the multibillionaires in the world are just over 2,000 people.
It's just another example of overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emissions trace of billionaires is thousands of times as high as that of the average population of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest contaminant of the planet, Roman Abramowicz, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emissary trail cooled down on his yacht, Eclipse, 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner is not on board the boat, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and let him take a boat from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superboat owners don't bring sympathy to other people when they, like the richest woman in Australia, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no room for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships in excess of 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly alcohol dose has been detected leading to intestinal cancer
American researchers have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of cancer.
This is published by the Daily Press.
The experts concluded that the use of four or more drinks a week involved a higher risk of cancer.
However, the risk of developing a disease increases with an increase in the quantity of alcohol used.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of intestinal cancer than women.
The exact cause of this kind of cancer cannot be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors lead to a process that is damaging to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or more precisely, all dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very clever.
But they don't even know how advanced four-legged animals are.
Biologists have been experimenting over the years to know for sure how the intelligence of animals is developed.
Although the dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as human, a new study proves that a dog can consistently react to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in Sciencealtert.
Dogs can't play chess or compose poems, understand nothing about politics, economy, and art, yet they're often able to fool their masters.
Some species, experts believe, have shown better results in understanding human language, but statistics are not enough for accurate conclusions.
For example, some species are commonly considered dog geniuses, such as Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and that their ability to learn is not inferior to a two - year - old child.

In Ukraine, they're ready for the US and Russia trade.
The US and Russia will be "trading" about Ukraine's entry into the North Atlantic, as explained by Analyst Alexander Kochetkov in an article for the Glossaurus.
In his view, Washington and Moscow were about to continue the talks on the United States guarantees that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden on the right of countries to “accede anywhere”.
If you're offered something that's known to be unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual bondage, you're not going to trade, you're going to just send the offeror.
And Ukraine is about to be traded," wrote an analyst.
Cochetkov added that Russia did not plan to attack Ukraine, but was seeking a dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are carried out secretly, quickly and immediately, to offensive actions rather than waiting for the group to be discovered and the forces of resistance deployed," he remarked.
China stimulates the development of the railway industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Transport and Machinery Expo, held in Zjujuw, Hunan Province/Centre China/
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotic Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, mentioned Hoo Zhaoven.
High-speed trains along the China-Lao railway, which was put into service earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will make the rolling stock more reliable and efficient.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased rail transport and many countries in Asia and Europe have witnessed “China's speed”.
In May of this year, the first double-deck electric trains developed in China, designed for export to Europe, came from a CRC Zhuzhou Locomative Co. production line.
At a maximum speed of 200 km/h, these trains will travel on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a pilot subway train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began operating.
The train will run along the metropolitan line connecting the centre of Istanbul to the airport of the city.
This subway line will be opened next year.
It'll be the fastest metro line in Turkey at a speed of 120 miles an hour.
"The Chinese railway equipment industry is one of the sectors with the highest levels of innovation and the greatest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxian, head of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade/CEBMT/.
"This industry represents the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-quality equipment on the world market," said Feng Yaoxian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, after a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of equipment for rail transport, with a full range of tools and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosian, the country ranks first in the level of railway electrification and in the running of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed early signs of dementia
A bioscientific candidate, Simeon Holoshakin, in a conversation with Radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive abuses, such as failure to concentrate, planning and a decline in abstract thinking.
A discussion is under way that hearing loss can be both an early occurrence of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, said the specialist.
Holoshakin stressed that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerational diseases, head injuries, some infection, metabolic disturbances, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that the atherosclerosis of the brain's atherosclerosis is the most common cause of this syndrome.
Biologists have observed that to date doctors do not know how to treat dementia effectively.
It is therefore necessary to start prevention on time.
He said that foreign language learning and active communication would help to reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress and regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory engagement and thinking logic
"There are recommendations for the application of various BADs, but their effectiveness and utility are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Holoshakin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical pressure, regularly training cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intense memory and thinking," said Holoshakin.
Previously, the British Dementia Foundation stated that the disease is affecting people over the age of 40.
The doctors mentioned the early symptoms of alzheimer.
The first warning sign is visual problems that make it difficult for a patient to detect objects.
Another sign of developing dementia was the aphasia, a condition in which a person could not find the right words to convey what he was going to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent for treatment abroad.
Former President of Georgia, Michael Saakashvili, needs psychological and recovery services abroad, has declared to journalists the neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of a medical consimilation set up under the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
The problems of movement, coordination, and perversity of character are persistent problems," said the specialist, noting that this is not beyond the norm and that the ex- president should now be sent to special rehab.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychological-yielding, which we did not find possible in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution which Georgia does not have.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotize his medical care after he had been subject to disciplinary punishment by prison officials.
Georgian policy had quickly succeeded in lifting the penalty and restoring itself to previous rights.

There were protests against COVID passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valentine there were protests against the mandatory COVID-19 immunisation certificate, which was handed over by Europe Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was about 3000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports became binding for bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, nursing homes and night-time entertainment.
Many demonstrators came to the stock without masks.
They blamed the State for totalitarianism with their posters and called for respect for citizens ' choices.
Vaccine passports will also be required for entrance to entertainment and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this town have declared a medical dictatorship, and immunisation has been called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected since the beginning of the epidemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to introduce restrictions on the non-vaccine population.
The Government introduced a bill on a single QR code system into the State Duma on 12 November.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities, with either a certificate of inoculation or transmission of disease or a medical examination of the vaccine.
The same rules will be set for trains and aircraft.

A steep rise: how Chinese become skiers
The Games should attract millions of people and help to create international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Games will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow President Xi Jingping to gather 1 trinium of yuan, but will also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiv Mountain resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the place where the Winter Games are held, is becoming more popular among the Chinese.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, greening is being carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many parts of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiaku, there are snow problems.
The main long-term challenge is to provide comfortable and interesting vacations in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Justin Downs, a consultant for the Games, said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry had changed to unrecognisable.
Every winter more Chinese go to the hills.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many years to create a ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in the agricultural and mine-mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and develop the infrastructure needed for rest.
The 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunley, near the winter Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a wave of winter sports.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chungley, they ran a high-speed railway, and now none of the locals suffers without work.
There are more and more stores in the country selling clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, they open common meals with national kitchen dishes.
There's even a testing station on COVID-19 in Taiwan now.
China seeks to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its sportsmen must become leaders of major international competitions, and resorts and equipment must achieve a global level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, reported by WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be plunged into extreme poverty because of the Coronauvirus Pandemic, which has slowed human progress on universal access to health services, has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the 12 December International Day for Universal Health Care, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
They found that the Pandemic had caused health problems and had caused excessive strain in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunisation has declined, and mortality from TB and malaria has increased.
WHO and WB highlighted that the Pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment.
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their pockets."
In October, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres announced that the Coronauvirus Pandemie had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and that more than four billion people had little social support.

Reuters: the Taiwanese Minister was shut down from the "Sammit for democracy" broadcast at the request of the White House
The presentation by Taiwan's Digital Technology Minister, Odry Tan, at the panel discussion during the United States-organized "Sammit for democracy" was translated into a video-free mode, as shown by the YouTube record.
Reuters, with reference to sources, claims that the image was disabled at the request of the White House.
They reported that the reason was a map on which Taiwan was distinguished by a separate colour from the PRC, which considered the island to be its territory.
The map, shown by Mrs. Tan, was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted as green as free, and the PRC, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Laos and Viet Nam as red as closed.
After the Minister showed the card, the picture on her side was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the discussants “do not necessarily express the position of the US government”.
The PRC was not invited to the "Sammit for democracy."
Reuters notes that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister may have run counter to the one-China policy that Washington maintains.
One source of the agency said that, after a map demonstration, the US National Security Council had angryly contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan a separate country.
The Washington "Sammit for democracy" took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of 110 countries and Territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize winner, Dmitry Muratov, editor-in-chief of the New Newspaper, called for the creation of an international foundation through which money obtained through corruption would be spent on charity.
Earlier today, the Russian Undersecretary of the Russian Federation, Yuri Averyanov, said that the summit had an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."

A set of dining-rooms called "Egoist-unit" with gold (4 objects).
The "Royal childhood" collection is one of the largest and most famous collections of children's silver in Russia.
It contains many charming models of silver spoons, forks and knives, rattles and emptys, jaws and cups.
All children's silver devices are subject to strict quality control.
Ecological silver produced directly at the factory makes the product perfectly safe for the child.
Thanks to the disinfectant function of silver, the regular use of silver devices can maintain the natural immunity of the body and even prevent some of the typical childhood diseases.
The factory's professionals received a grant to apply a complex but very beautiful guilloche technology that Carl Faberge used.
This made it possible to create amazingly bright and extensive images on the product.
The collection is full of cute characters that will make a child a faithful friend.

A New Shepard spaceship with six tourists flew a suborbital flight
On Saturday, December 11th, the New Shepard Blue Origin, with six tourists on board, flew a suborbital flight.
The trip broadcast on the company's website lasted a total of more than ten minutes, after which the passenger capsule came down to Earth, reports the TASS.
A launch vehicle was launched from a launch site in the U.S. city of Van Horn, Texas.
The ship had risen to a height of just over 100 km, and space tourists were in a state of weightlessness.
The launch vehicle itself landed state-wide on the launch site.
Blue Origin successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard with passengers on board on 20 July.
THE WARNING OF THE MOSKlVlVlS.
Don't be in one pile-- bad people happen, you may have a problem with them on a specific occasion...
But what does it have to do with the number of kids, the age, the pension fund, etc.?
Write that they're "the bastards, they haven't returned the money."
And that's how long and when they're having kids, it's none of your business unless they're going to hang these kids around your neck.
And since that's not possible, what right do you have to judge them for?
I guess it's just education so...
Chosen parents (by themselves) dictate their rules, openly ignoring existing ones.
What if this applies to other areas of life, justice, etc.?
There are no laws written for them.
What if the pope does introduce his education and education methods?
The horror of some kind of example for others is very bad.

China is stepping up the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in towns where land access points are located
A joint mechanism for prevention and control of the State Council of the PRC issued a circular requiring that the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic be enhanced in the cities where the land gates are located, with a view to further preventing the import of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities are required to provide a negative result of the test for nucleic acids of COVID-19 obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those who come to the cities where land passes are located must, upon arrival, take at least one test for the nucleic acids of COVID-19.
The document states that these requirements will apply from the day when the respective administrative units at the provincial level identify and publish the areas of the towns in question, up to 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is observed that cities where land access points are located and which meet certain conditions may consider creating buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The springing orthopedic mattress of the OC Base is one of the most cost-effective models in the ruler.
The practical filling of the Foam Balance gives the mattress all the necessary orthopedic properties, but leaves the price at the budget level.
This product is the best combination of price and quality.
Balance foam is a modern material that comes from PSPs.
The filler is hypoallergenic and secure.
That's why foam is widely used in industry.
Its safety and credibility have been confirmed by a special certificate received in Europe, where such requirements are much more severe than those of Russians.
Another important quality of the Foam Balance is its orthopaedic nature: the material maintains the right position of the person throughout the sleep.
Because of the foam, the mattress acquired a stiffness below the average level, so the product is considered to be quite soft.
SuperSprings is the main carrying block in the mattress.
It's remarkable for the content of independent springs, and it's got 256 elements per square metre right here.
The practical block weighs up to 100 kg per sleeping space, distributes the load and adapts the surface to sleep, increasing the orthopaedic quality of the foam.
The manufacturer provides a choice between a spring block of 12 cm high and 18 cm high without changing the final value.
Please specify your preferences when ordering the store manager.
The mattress is presented in a tricotial blanket, with a model height of 21 cm.
The case is indistinguishable.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.

The MFA reported a "comfortable conclusion" between Russia and the United States.
Sergey Ryabkov, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in an interview with the "Ivests" rated the prospects for Moscow and Washington's relationship.
He said that the long road of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but there's a certain prospect of improving relationships that's completely unpredictable.
That is the sad conclusion of the long journey that we have made with both the present administration and Trump and Obama.
The problem didn't start yesterday," said the briefcase.
According to Ryabkov, the problem lies in the US's desire to force Russia's approach on many issues.
The MFA has added that it would not be risky to provide optimistic projections of prospects for improved relationships and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, there was no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls upon the United States to take responsible action on international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will heed the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting with US secretary Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
The virus warned of the risk of inoculation of a nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
In the case of allocatives for COVID-19, they may be allergic and need medical help, so the first points to inoculate this drug should not be arranged at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS by a virologist, a RAN correspondent member, and by the Bionano-Technology, Microbiology and Virology Laboratory of Novosibirs State University, Sergei Netes.
It's easier to set up hospital and commercial centers for the first time, but I'd only do it in health care.
The fact is that the risk of allergic reactions to such a vaccine is low, but it is desirable that the person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very needed," said Netes.
According to the virologist, it would be possible to think about immunisation in shopping centers once experience in the use of the drug had been gained.
He also stressed that in using a solo vaccine, it was important that it hit the mucus in the nose.
However, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the nose-injected is shrivelled after the injection.

Serbia produced 2 million doses of Sputnik V.
Satellite V Vaccine is the most popular in Serbia.
Serbia produced about 2 million doses of Russian Sputnik V, as told by TASS's Minister for innovation and technological development, Nanda Popovic.
"The Torlak State Institute still produces about 2 million doses of Sputnik V, expected to produce at least 4 million in the coming period," said Popovic.
He said that Russian vaccine was most popular with the Serbian population.
As a result, the Republic plans to purchase more than one million doses of the vaccine from Russia.
The Minister for innovation and technological development of Serbia has also expressed interest in the production of Sputnik V and Sputnik Light in the State.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Michustin reported that the Russian Federation had supplied Serbia with nearly two million doses of domestic Coronavirus infection.

The Benarti Prime Orto mattress S1000145x190.
The Prime Orto S1000 mattress with different sides of stiffness, the total height of the mattress is 22 cm.
Maximum allowable load per sleeping place up to 150 kg.
The base of the mattress is the independent spring block "S1000" (1,000 springs per bed).

In the United Kingdom, 1,239 cases of OMicron-stamp coronavirus-RT were recorded in 24 hours.
In the United Kingdom, 1,239 cases of infection were detected within 24 hours with the new omicron strain of the coronavirus.
Sky News reports this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of "omicron" have been detected in England, 38 people have contracted a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people affected by COVID-19 from the new strain in the United Kingdom reached 3,137.
Earlier, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had estimated in a pessimistic prediction that 75,000 people could die in England by April due to an explosion of coronavirus caused by the "omicron" strain.
Sandov warned of the suffering of Western countries imposing anti-Russian sanctions
The Spokesman of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, had commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive action” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “injuries” into the country.
"Some restrictions against Russia and no suffering for yourself are impossible," said the Kremlin's official on the TV channel Russia 1.
Sandov claims it's "know everybody in the world."
It was previously reported that the US was considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian energy sanctions as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions that will make it difficult for Russian banks and the Russian direct investment fund to convert rubles into dollars.
At the same time, the head of the Sberbank, Hermann Gref, is convinced that this is impossible.
From the right thinkers, that's the right comment!

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of the participants refused to withdraw from France.
On December 12th, BFM.TV, a French television channel, reported this.
96.5 percent of the voters opposed independence.
The population of the South Pacific archipelago is 3.51% independent of France.
2.99% of the votes were cancelled.
The voting rate on that day was very low, with about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago coming to the site.
According to experts, the low appearance was due to calls by the separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to defer the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
A referendum on independence was already held in the region in 2018.
Most of the inhabitants supported the location of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 miles from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia to be its domain.
Some 270,000 people live on the archipelago, and the Territory enjoys a special administrative-territorial status.
The 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration provides that the region may organize a vote on its independence twice, with a difference of two years.

WHO presumes that "omicron" is less dangerous than "detta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) presumes that the “omicron” is less dangerous than the delta-stam of the coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of a decline in the efficiency of the vaccines in the new version of COVID-19.
According to information as of 9 December, there are 63 countries registered with the "omicron".
"Preliminary data and a significantly modified anti-geneous protein profile of the "micron" strain suggest that the anti-infection and anti-transmission effects of the vaccine will be reduced.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it ("the severity of the disease" -Red.) may be less severe than in the case of a "detta"" , says a WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of “omicrone” infection in the EU are easily or unsymptomed.
However, the new strain is estimated to spread faster than the delta.
There were two cases of omicron-stamp infection in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," reported the Gamaley Center.
The head of Rostlyznadzor, Anna Popov, stated that there was still no reliable evidence that the new version of the coronavirus was less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine, four scripts were named for the
Vadim Denisenko, the Ex-Deputy of the Verkhovna Rada, listed four options for developments for President Vladimir of Ukraine in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State could remain without Western support and might also compromise on Donbas.
On Sunday, December 12th, Denisenko spoke about this in a publication on the Glossary Portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm," suggests that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development would contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev might face in 2023.
"The price of the key goods that we have traditionally exported is on a par with the decline ...> internal protests and opposition to key FPGs (profit-industry groups)." added an ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario -- "war against everyone."
This prediction will come true in the event of a high degree of turbulence in global politics, in which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, Ukraine's leadership may compromise on Donbass, which may lead to domestic opposition.
At the end of the summer, Greenski's position will be weakened, and the probability of such a situation, according to the former Nardep, is up to 50-55%.
The third option in Ukraine's policy is to challenge disagreeable groups of the population and the President, which makes it possible to take control of the force bloc and carry out “populist initiatives”.
In the course of such a crisis, Greenski will start a "reform of power," added Denisenko.
Another scenario is to turn Greenski into a "Father of the nation."
This may result in an event that will be a great shock to society.
"The event must be large enough to trigger reactions from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," said Denisenko.
Such an option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made disaster or Russian aggressive action, and an ex-deputee considers it possible.
However, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was the Ukrainian authorities, the United States and the United States that have increased military activity along Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, a survey of the Reiting Sociological Group showed that the rating of the Ukrainian President had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest number since his election as Head of State.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the imminent election of the President of Ukraine for Zelenski, only 21.8 per cent would vote, while for the former President of Petr Poroshenko, 14.5 per cent.
However, only 19.3 per cent of all the President's support was expressed.

The other wins were also enjoyed, as they were for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all the then Soviet sportsmen.

He was arrested for an action in Red Square by poets who said, "For the quote of Eutouchenko, 10 days, that's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, a 21-year-old poet, Alexander Volchenkov, was arrested for ten days.
A student of the U.S.A. was arrested in Red Square with a poster on which a hashtag #poets of more poets was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugenius Eutoshenko.
A protocol was drawn up for Alexander on the administrative article on the repeated infringement of the public action.
He was first arrested on 23 January in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to attract attention to poetry in general; now, unfortunately, interest in it has been lost, to the decline of a common culture in Russia, and also a small hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," Alexander explained.
We contacted a young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to explain his message more thoroughly.
How have police officers treated you this time and before?
What did the department ask how your stock was commenting?
This time the officers were more accurate, detention as polite as possible, as funny as it sounded in some context of the word.
At Pushkin, they took the OMONs and took them hard.
Asked standard about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not positive, it was understandable.
Except for the four-sided monkey shop, it was perfectly correct, but I knew what it was going on.
And if after the stock under this hashtag they start writing their poems, at least a few people, I'm going to do that for a reason.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak privately in the Tumba-Yumba language.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of others, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in the mother tongue through an interpreter.
It's protocol and nothing else, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks perfectly Russian and nevertheless uses the assistance of an interpreter.
Also at official events, an old-fashioned spelling is performed, and a stenographer is not required to speak several languages.

Researchers explained how potatoes help to cope with age problems
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that improve blood flow and reduce cholesterol levels.
The roots are those of groups B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, ribophlavin, folic acid and pantootenic acid.
All these elements help the system of the body to function.
Potatoes also help to combat age abuse.
Due to the high cell content, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract and, if used regularly, can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the best use, root is better extinguished or cooked than roasted on oil.
Earlier, The Daily Expression had warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, like other high-glyke products.
These are products containing carbohydrates that quickly split into sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Commercials newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian dining potatoes, noting that their production in private farms had declined and processing capacity had increased.
In the view of the market, the current supply gap will only replace imports.

But some -- Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix -- did survive, including regularly changing their domain name, he added.
For example, in the Lostfilm, which is available in the search for both the Yandex and Google, you can see pirate copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "The tenderness" by the director Anna Melician, the original series of the Russian largest video service, ivi (entered by AIV).
You can see the Encanto animation novel on the film, which is also available in the search engine, but based on the quality of the video, it's a so-called screen (a pirate copy of the film made in a movie theater).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, there's a series called "Universe. 10 Years Later" available on TV TNT (entered in Gazprom Media).
Svetlana M., I'm sorry, of course, but I don't care if my son's upset about mommy or not.
If there's some confusion going on, it's best not to get involved at all, the estimates are on their way.
Well, of course, this rarely happens.

"This Polish idea" -- rather, it would have been said that Poland had just rediscovered the idea of 1776, but it had developed it quite effectively.
In fact, the motto "Order is Not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, in general, doesn't really change the point.
I was watching her interview, and the girl said that the biggest dream of her growing wings is that her dad always pulls her off.
Well, it's as if it's all very doubtful.
So I went to college, and then what?
The light is the wall of Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
The wide circumference of the "molecules" of light provides as uniform and bright a light as possible.
"Atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the nature and nature of each subject, does not lose its validity and makes it possible to place its accents in the interior.
One of the characteristics of such lamps is the impossibility of design.
With thin, almost invisible cables that are adjusted in heights, it makes it feel like the lamp floats in the air.
The metallic gold armor and the matt-and-white miniature phonographs will easily add to any palette, and the gallery and berries presented in the collection will be the ready ensemble for lighting the living room, the bedroom and the hallway.
Well, it tastes like the color that's called.
I really liked "Tarchoon," not the present one, of course.
Very tasty were the saps in the spill from high glass cylinders.
Three pieces of syrup is too much for my taste.
Two were exactly the same.
Dimax Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Micro Ultimate's orthopedic spring mattress.
The model is convenient because it has two softly different surfaces, a high stiffness and a little more than the average.
The product is composed of only high-quality and high-quality fillings, which have proved to be of the best value.
Springs: An independent micropackage spring block is installed in the centre of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals on the bed, which work completely autonomously.
It's their function that provides a unique point-based adjustment.
Micropackage is the highest-frequency of the variety of spring blocks called Dimaxa, so it has a distinct orthopedic effect and is considered primal.
Fillers: combinations of carpet layers and natural latex are installed from top and bottom of springs.
The only difference is the order of the stoves.
If there's latex on one surface, there's coconut coke on the other.
This is a long time ago classically filled-in tandulum because it transfers not only orthopedic but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If the carpet provides the right back support, the latex will adapt the surface to the human body.
Cologne: The model is presented in the protruding tricottic arcade of Aloe Vera.
At the customer's request, it can be made both filmed and fixed.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping space is 170 kg.
Safeguards and security: the guarantee period is three years.
The mattress received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and security in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists are going to look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to find signs of life in the atmosphere, and reported on Sunday to the "Actual Chamber".
The goal of the five-year-old missions is to evaluate the fitness of the clouds of Venus, and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have offered tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
So far, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the nearest planet to Earth, were too acidic to exist there, but probably originally Venus was a planet of the Earth type.
A sample from Venus should arrive during the third mission.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question is whether it's Earth-like or different.
If so, it will be evident that life on earth has not begun.
And if it's different, it's probably more likely that life is born on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Michael Paisal.

The metavolents will change Russian business
The theme of metavolents became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the biggest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
So business in Russia, like the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own metavolents and then monetizing them.
The metavolents should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to create remote interactions in a pandemic environment is because people are tired of divisiveness and limitations.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
Third, they are a logical continuation of the digitalization of the asset, where any rights, security, works of art, and even money are digitized.
Anya, you're right, changing the diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you don't want anything too fat and dangerous anymore.
Of course, we're going to have traditional olyves and herrings under my coat, but nobody makes me eat everything at once.
You can eat a spoon, try it, and that's enough.
For there are ten days ahead, and you can cook any delicious and useful dishes.
And how hard, how long, how much money she needed in training.
And after five fourth jumps, she's gone with no gold.
She also realizes that she will never survive four years until the next olympiade, i.e. she will never be an olympian champion.
And someone who doesn't just sport or can't imagine all the circles of hell that she's gone through, don't lie down.
The British economist was unable to predict 2022
The British economist Jim O'Neal was unable to predict for 2022 because he believed that such attempts would fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert is of the opinion that next year will be full of unpredictability and any tendency may change turn.
The most important factor is the Coronauvirus Pandemic, and the second is inflation, he thinks.
O'Neal also admitted that he did not know whether the price increases for goods were temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, it was clear before the Pandemic that “the world of the infinite generousness of central banks has already outlived itself” and it is time to return to a relationship where inflationary interest rates will correlate with the expected rate of GDP growth.
O'Neal pointed out that, against the background of the epidemic, the continuation of super-soft economic policies might, according to some experts, lead to a new inflation surge.
Attention should also be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as to the rise in poverty and climate change, as summarized by O'Neal.
Earlier, the head of Global Research, Open Investment, Mikhail Schulgin, reported that positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remained, with less potential for growth.
Among the risks to the dollar was the Fed's monetary policy, oil price movements and fears in the context of the Coronauvirus Pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is, when you compare yourself to yourself, there were fewer containers five years ago.
It's better now.
There's progress, only slow.
There's a problem: there's a lot of environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
All sorts of ecotaxes that take waste from the house.
It's a trivial reception point. It's used by the Marginals.
It's rare to bring glass and metal in.

Russians gave about 4.5 percent of the country's GDP to autodealers
After 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 Billion roubles on the purchase of new cars, 28% more than in the same period last year, statistics from the Russian Automobile Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about three billion rubles) was spent by the State on supporting citizens and the economy during the Coronavirus Pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of country of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Poetin said that this amount was compatible with more than 4.5 per cent of the country's 2020 gross domestic product (GNI).
Korea's Chinese brand is leading the Russian market for revenue.
In the 10 months of this year, he managed to sell 325.7 billion roubles, almost 24% more than a year earlier.
Kia's Hyundai family has an even larger growth rate of over 35%, while the income from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In leading positions, this brand and in raising the weighted average car price, Hyundai grew by almost 21% in a year, to 1.94 million roubles, and it only had a stronger movement in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, the sales of Korean brands have increased less significantly: according to statistics from the Auto Manufacturers' Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kya has done 9.4 per cent more cars in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
The three leaders of the Japanese Toyota commercial sales industry have spent 275.5 billion roubles on their cars in 10 months, an increase of 14% over the previous year.
The Japanese follow the Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion roubles (+75 per cent) - the German prize-breed has grown by 37 per cent and the weighted average car price (almost 28 per cent up to 8.2 million roubles).
"Mercedes-Benz simultaneously has a good sales rate and a weighted average price--more, for example, than BMW--from here and a larger financial capacity," explained NAP Director Tatiana Arabaj.--
At the rate of sales growth, fantastic performance is shown by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased financial capacity this year."
Russian Lada shows an average of 28% of the market and 229.4 billion roubles spent on cars in 10 months.
At last year's financial capacity there are companies whose car sales dropped in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
The USF, in the negative, spent 12 billion roubles on SUVs and pickups in 10 months, compared to 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
Against the background of supply problems and production breaks across the world, motor companies continue to continuously adjust prices, the same AutoVaz raised the cost of the Lada models seven times a year, the last journey (by 8 to 10,000 roubles) occurred at the end of November.
Prices are regularly rewritted to their products and to other automakers.
Russia's car market will increase in monetary terms -- apart from the shortage of cars, inflation is contributing to this, as well as the drive of car concerts to win back past losses, experts believe.
Given the shortage of cars, I think that many car concerts have even been able to partially transfer to the consumer the costs of past periods which they have not been able to place at the price of cars before,
Says an analyst at the BTB Capital on Vladimir Bespalov's motorway.
I believe that, financially, automakers are feeling very well right now, maintaining a high marketing margin."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, and the price of new cars is rising faster than inflation, explained by the expert.
In the long run, the market will grow in both quantitative and monetary terms, but mainly because of inflation and the complexity of machine design itself, predicts Bespails.
As supply increases, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, Russian authors will continue to grow next year, even if the cost of cars slows down, motorists will be able to earn their income from the volume, notes Sergei Burgasliev, an independent consultant on the road.
Given the increased demand and undersupply, motorists are now trying to make the greatest profit from each car sold, notes Burgasliyev.
No increase in car production is expected in the next six months, and Russia's anxiety is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the market situation, cars have proved to be a good asset for investment -- a car bought a year ago, even after a mileage, can now be sold more than the original cost, the expert notes.
Biden spoke of a US military transfer to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion
The US leadership had never considered sending the US military to Ukraine in the case of Russia's "disposition."
President Joe Biden of the United States made this statement.
"There was never such a plan," said the White House head, replying to a journalist's question whether the US had given up such an idea.
Biden said that if the situation around Ukraine escalated, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the US and the North Atlantic Organization had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an increase.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using US troops on a one-way basis to defend Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the US would move forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO ( Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic).
"We'll have to send more American and Nazi troops to the east flank, B9 -- all those countries of the North Atlantic Organization in respect of which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, President Dmitry Pescove's press secretary had stressed that Moscow had no intention of invading Ukraine.
However, he pointed out that Moscow saw the problem in the military use of Turkish-led nuclear weapons by Kiev and that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
I'm leaving this interview right away.
If they're trying to get me to listen to screams, to wait for hours, to drink a strange beer and to wash another cup, it's frightful to imagine what's going to happen at work.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, such as a "MVD employee" or other force structure, it's not effective to drop it immediately, and to put it on a blacklist is likely not to be able to make it.
Because in order to prove his lies about his association with security structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to frighten and persuade.
More useful recommendations are needed for the people.
That's ridiculous.
I can't believe it was like that.
They don't know who to blame anymore.
We've got the Queen.
And most importantly, they think it's everyone's fault except the most...
It wouldn't be easier to leave people alone from being forced, of course, if our people care about their people.
