Members of the Welsh Assembly don't want to "go to the mappets"
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is a dissatisfaction with the proposal to accept MWP abbreviations for their names (from the Member of the Welsh Parliament, Welsh Parliamentarian).
The problematic solution is to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One of the Laborists, expressing his party's views, expressed his concern that the new abbreviation was "recycled by Twp and Pwp".
For our readers not from Wales: on the Wallian twp means "bump," and pwp means "cop."
According to a member of the Welsh Party, his organization was generally “disgruntled” and offered other options.
The members of the Conservative Party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in the Welsh language is spoken about as a letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently in the process of drawing up a bill on the change of name, made the following statement: “The final decision on the name of the members of the Assembly will of course remain with them”.
The Welsh Administration Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Committee published a public opinion poll on the options suggested, according to which the Welsh Parliament option instead of the Assembly had found widespread support among the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members option, while the MWP option received the greatest public support.
It seems that the members of the Assembly offer other options, but the President, Elin Jones, will find it difficult to find a solution that suits everyone; let us recall that the draft law on change should be submitted within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly's work process, including new rules on disqualifying members of the Assembly and setting up the Committee's system.
Members of the Assembly will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote to rename the country as the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
A popular vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” presupposes a territorial claim against the Greek province, and has repeatedly objected to the accession of its northern neighbour to the European Union and to NATO.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he was not going to accept the results.
However, the advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, note that changing the name of the country is just the price of joining the EU and the North Atlantic Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Crisis in Harlem parishes: St. Martin's bells are forever silent
"The neighborhood I spoke to used to say that there was a bar at each corner and a church at each corner," Adams says.
"And now there's nothing left."
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
"The format of communication has changed."
"The bar has ceased to be a sort of living-room of the entire district, where they regularly came."
But as for churches, it is a matter of concern that the money received from the sale of the asset will be short enough, no matter how much their leaders hope.
At the church, he added, there would be a multi-family house whose occupants were unlikely to support those who remained in the parish.
“The majority of the customers of these apartments will be white,” Adams says. “This will bring the day when such churches will finally close, because new neighbors will never become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by the White Congregation before Harlem became a black district: the Metropolitan Comunity in 1870 and St. Martin's Church 10 years later.
The first members of the Methodist Church left the parish in the 1930s.
Their building was bought by a black parish located next door.
When St. Martin's church came into the hands of the black community, it was led by the reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, Harlem's main trade artery, where they refused to hire or raise blacks.
In 1939 the fire caused considerable damage to the building, and during the reconstruction work Father Johnsson's parishioners ordered the installation of the carillon.
The reverend David Johnsson, the son of Father Johnsson, who had replaced him at the head of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the Carillon "the colons for the poor."
But the expert who tried the carillon in July called it a different term: "cultural legacy" and "unique historical instrument."
An expert from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also said that it was the Carillon of St. Martin's Church that was the world's first instrument of some sort played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lindh. He was invited 18 years ago to play at the larger Carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's Church has not yet replaced him.
Over the past few months, the Church of St. Martin has experienced a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by secular church leaders and others by the Episcopal Church.
The parish assembly, a parish-governing body composed of secular leaders, addressed the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to transfer the value of the works” to the parochial assembly, although the latter had no bearing on the choice of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the diocese's lack of transparency.
In California, a shark shot a 13-year-old lobster diver.
Official sources reported that on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a 13-year-old diver in California was attacked by a shark and injured.
The attack occurred about 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach Beach Beach Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Humble told in an interview with the KSWB-TV station (San Diego), he dived with friends on Saturday morning and heard a boy shout for help about half an hour later, and he and his friends swam on a boat to the scene of the attack and pulled the teenager out of the water.
According to Hampel, at first he decided that the boy was very excited to catch a lobster, but quickly "recognize that he was shouting, 'I've been bitten!'
I've been bitten!"
A swim to the diver, Humble noticed that "his skin was completely ripped around the collarbone."
"I shouted that everyone should get out of the water, 'Here's a shark,' says Humble.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Redi Children's Hospital in San Diego; his condition is considered critical.
The species of a shark attacking a teenager is unknown.
The rescue officer, Captain Larry Giles, reported during a press briefing that a shark had been spotted a few weeks ago, but had not been classified as a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim of the attack had been injured in the upper body region.
The authorities closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the population.
Giles observed that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seynsbury plans to take over the British perfume-cosmetic market.
Seynsbury is going to install a cosmetics and perfume department in the Butts, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetics counselors, using the suite store model.
The British perfume and cosmetic market is estimated at Pound2.8 billion and continues to expand, while the fashion and goods for the house are falling; in order to capture a large portion of this desirable market as an experiment, 11 stores throughout the country will be presented with large sections of cosmetics and perfume industry, and, if successful next year, they will be expected in many other stores.
Supermarket owners are looking for something to fill the shelf that used to be used for television, microwave stoves, household goods, and investments in the perfume-cosmetic market seem to be a good solution.
According to the representatives of Seinesbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3000 names, including for the first time stamps such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PowPaw.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, at special locations, by the type of product management in the Butts stores.
In addition, a customized line of "Butics-Cosmetics" products will be rebuilt, switching to vegan products to meet the demands of young customers.
The first one already opened in Croydon in South London last week, and the second one is expected to be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet trade and the tendency to buy a small amount of food every day in small shops close to home have led supermarkets to attract customers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President Seinesbury, says that the athletes will gradually become a department store, and his supermarket network is fighting for customers to compete against cheap shops such as Aldy and Leedle, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Seynsbury supermarkets host Argos, and some of them have now found Habitat stores since the network acquired both stamps two years ago, resulting in increased sales of food and revenue from these purchases.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give new life to their cosmetics and medicine department have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Seinesbury and Butes was organized, but there were further differences among participants on the sharing of the income from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Seynsbury Pharmaceutical Business (only 281 stores) to Celecio, the owner of the Lloyds Farmasy network, for £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a broad line of leather suites to La Roche-Posay and Vicky in four stores.
Says Paul Mills-Hix, the business director of Seynsbury: "We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics divisions to create a more favourable environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained counsellors who will always be available to help the counsel.
Our variety of stamps for any taste, pleasant design and convenience of shops will attract many visitors to search for cosmetics and perfumeria, which will be a completely new concept of shopping."
Peter Jones "reacted badly" to Holly Willoughby's exit from the £11 million deal.
Peter Jones, the star of the show "The Dragon's Logs," was "frequently" with Holly Willoughby's release from a £11 million deal she intended to make with Peter's Lifestyle brand, but instead preferred new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their joint home clothes and Truly accessory.
This couple's business was compared to Gwinette Paltrow's Goop label.
The 37-year-old host of this morning's program announced her decision in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their lucrative Lifestyle-Brand to focus on the new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV led to the fury of Peter Jones, the star of the Dragon's Log.
According to our sources, Jones was “infuriated” when a favorite of the viewers at a busy meeting held on Tuesday at his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after having entered into a new contract of up to 1.5 million, she would not have enough time to share their home clothes and Truly accessories.
Their mark was compared to the child's actress, Gwinette Paltrow, with a Goop mark, and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
A 37-year-old host announced her departure from Instagram, while Jones himself left the United Kingdom on a private plane in the direction of one of her villas.
According to one source, "Tooly's Mark was Holly's top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give it a careless existence for the next couple of decades.
Her decision has upset all the parties to the deal.
Everyone was amazed at what happened on Tuesday, as the stamps were about to start for weeks.
A warehouse filled with goods ready for sale remained at Marlowe's headquarter.
The experts believe that the departure of the leading "This morning," one of the most popular stars in the UK, can cost a firm £1 million because of significant investments in goods, from pillows and candles to clothes, as well as the potential delay in launching the line.
It is also a question of breaking up a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby created a brand of Truly with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, Peter Jones, was 52 years old, and he ran the company in March.
Both couples often spend their vacations together, and Jones also owns 40 percent of Dan Baldwin's shares.
Willoughby will be the M&S M&S messenger and replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of the ITV show "I'm a Celebrity".
A source from Jones' close environment said last night, "We can't comment on his business."
Hard talks, "and then we fell in love with each other"
He made a joke about the criticism that the media would have against him because of the "unworthy President" comment and the positive feedback of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump refuse so many claims?
Says Trump, imitating the voice of the news speaker.
"I did not give up anything."
He said that Kim Jong-un was interested in a re-entered meeting, after Trump had called them the first summit held in Singapore in June a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons stocks in North Korea.
But the declaratory talks have reached a dead end.
Three months after the June Singapore summit, North Korean high-level official Lee Young Ho spoke to world leaders at a meeting of the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying that North Korea was still awaiting a “appropriate response” from the US after the initial Democratic People's Republic of Korea's disarmament measures.
Instead, the US, he said, continues to use sanctions as leverage.
During the meeting of his followers, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
"With North Korea things are wonderful," he said.
"We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have a wonderful relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un had borne fruit: rocket testing had ended, hostages had been released and United States soldiers who remained in the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea had also returned to their country.
With regard to his relationship with Kim Jong Eun, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomatic was not strange.
"It's easy to present yourself to the President, but instead of 10,000 people on the street, who are rushing into this completely slain hall, there would be only 200 people here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: fatal destruction recorded, hundreds of casualties
In the early days of the earthquake that struck Lomboc, a foreign NGO said that their assistance was unnecessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lomboca population had lost a roof over its head, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national disaster, which was a requirement for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that there is no need for international support, so it was difficult,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children prepares a team to go to Palau, but we don't know if a foreign group can work on the ground yet.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian leadership was conducting an assessment of the situation in Palau in order to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
Given the persistent seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains horrendously ill-prepared for natural disasters.
While shelter for the tsunami has been built in Aceh, it is rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite the warning of the tsunami threat, there was no alarm in Palau to alert the population, which is likely to have caused so many casualties.
Transport between many Indonesian islands is rather difficult even in good weather.
Natural disasters make it even more difficult to maintain a logistic environment.
A floating hospital, formerly fixed in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake, is headed to Palau, but the road to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo made Indonesia's old infrastructure the mainstay of his campaign and spent enormous resources on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for a new term next year, has become overwhelmed with funding problems.
The President has also been criticized for exacerbating sectarian enmity between the conservative majority of Muslims in Indonesia and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people had been killed and tens of thousands had lost their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed Machetes, bows with arrows and other self-shooting.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score against the Chelsey game naked to the far upper corner of the gate
Daniel Starridge saved the Liverpool from losing for the 89th minute of the Chelsey Prime League match at Stamford Bridge Stadium on Saturday.
Starridge got a pass from Jerdan Shakari about 27 meters from the Chelsey gate when his team was playing with a score of 1-0.
It moved to the left and broke into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and ended up in a distant top corner of the grid.
Golquiper Kepa Arrisabaloga jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Starridge said, "It was all about getting in that position and getting a ball, players like Shak, always playing as much as possible at the attack, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible."
"I saw Kante coming to me, I seized the ball, and I hit the gate for a little while."
At the end of the first half of the match, the Chelsey team held a score of 1-0, scored a goal for 25 minutes by a Belgian man named Eden Azar.
The central Chelsey attacker, passing back to Mateo Kovacic, broke through the middle of the field into half the Liverpool.
In the middle of the field, Kovacich played a game on one touch.
Then he passed the passage to Azar, who went out on the gate.
Azar overcame the protection, and from the left flank struck the doorman of the Liverpool, and struck the far corner of the grid.
Liverpool will meet the Napoleon team at the group stage of the League of Champions, and the match will take place at the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
"Chelsey" will play with the Videoton Club in a UEFA European League match to be held on Thursday in London, also at 3 p.m.
The number of victims of the Indonesian Tsunami increased to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, reported to the National Disaster Management Authority on Sunday morning.
According to reports, under the ruins of buildings destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richer scale, the earthquake occurred on Friday and caused a earthquake of up to six meters high, reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official of the Office during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000 people, was overwhelmed by the rubble of the collapsed houses.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of wounding a woman in death.
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead County, Mercyside, and a murder investigation is under way.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at the Grayson Mews Complex on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are searching for possible witnesses to the murder among the locals.
The police inspector O'Hagen says, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I strongly request everyone who was in John Street in Birkenhead and could observe or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also address everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who might have picked up something on the video recorder, and please contact us with any information that might help the investigation."
A police official confirmed that the victim had lived in Birkenhead and her body had been found in the compound.
This afternoon, alleged acquaintances arrived at the scene to ask their questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is under way and police officers are preparing to report the tragedy of the victim's immediate relatives.
A taxi driver living in the Grayson Mews complex tried to get into his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he learned what had happened, he lost his ability to speak.
The people at home were told that they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One police officer told the occupant that the entire surrounding area was considered a crime scene.
One woman cried.
"What a horror!" she repeated.
At 2 p.m. two police buses arrived at the scene and another remained outside the fence.
A few police officers were placed inside the fence to monitor the apartment complex.
Anyone with any information is requested to send a personal message to @MerPolCC on Twitter, call number 101, or contact Krimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 (case 247 of 30 September).
Kromwell's monument in front of the House of Parliament led to a violent debate about the "census of history"
Cromwell's exile would be a well-deserved revenge for the barbaric destruction of the numerous cultural and religious artifacts of England by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Remembrance Society called Mr. Crick's proposal a "craziness" and an "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Memory Society, said: "In the ongoing debate about the destruction of historical monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell was invariably raised in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconic movement during the English civil wars.
Perhaps Oliver Cromwell suffers for the sins of his ancestors, Thomas, who lived forever before.
Sir William Hamo Tornicroft's magnificent statue of Cromwell's authorship reflects the views of his contemporarys in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still regard as worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case to be a monarchy.
Whether this view is considered to be historicalally accurate remains the subject of professional debate.
But we can say with confidence that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century has affected our country's subsequent development, and Cromwell was a significant historical person representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as a Lord Protector are also highly appreciated and respected.
A Chinese farmer was killed by a murderer pig.
In one of the markets in southwest China, a farmer has become a victim of a pig, reports local media.
The victim's bloody body (the media only mentions his last name, "Yuan") was found with a broken artery near a dump at the market in Lupancheu County, Guizhou, southern China, reported by the Morning Post Sunday.
The pig farm prepares to immunize pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Sinin County, Qinghai Province of China.
Yuan and his cousin came from neighbouring Yunnan Province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin found Yuan's dead body, and the door to the next porkyard was open.
There was a huge cartilage in the pig shop with blood on it.
Forensics found that a 250-pound pig ate the farmer's death.
"My brother's legs were bleeding and maimed," said Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the victim.
The video from the security cameras showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the newspaper Evening News that the pig had been isolated in a separate frame during the investigation, in order to avoid further attacks.
It is reported that the Yuan family is engaged in discussions with the market administration on compensation for the farmer's death.
Swine attacks on people are rare.
In 2016 the pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal nailed a Wallian farmer to a tractor and let go, only frightened by a young wife.
In 2012, a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs, and as a Canadian farmer explained to CBC News, pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood taste can affect their hidden attack as a trigger mechanism.
"Pigs of the game,
They're biting and very curious, but they don't want to hurt you.
You should just instill in your animals a sense of measure and respect,' he explained.
Hurricane Rose will bring the rains to a large part of Southwest America
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to lose power by moving through a colder zone to the north coast of Mexico.
However, over the next few days it will bring rain and flooding to northern Mexico and southwest America.
On Saturday morning, 5 a.m. in New York, the Cyclone reached number 1 with winds up to 1335 km/h, 360 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move eastward to the West coast of the United States, and approaching the coast of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical moisture north of Mexico, to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, more than 25 cm of precipitation is expected in Mexico.
In the coming days, heavy rains are expected in South-West as a result of tropical moisture falling into an emerging low-pressure zone.
The rain from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous flooding, dirt streams and possible landfalls in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern States of Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical air moisture, the precipitation rate may be 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some parts of the Southwest US, mostly in most of Arizona, it is expected to yield up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation.
The risk of sudden rapid flooding due to the unequal distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
With the present risk of tropical rain, walking in the desert has serious consequences.
Livins can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunder can cause violent winds and clouds of dust.
With the emergence of a low-pressure zone, the southern coast of California will rain.
It is possible to fall up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small mud streams and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first precipitation since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
Sunday afternoon and Monday morning in Arizona will be followed by tropical rains that will spread to other areas by Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday the rains will take place in the Four corners and will last until Wednesday evening.
In October, there will be sharp temperature swings across the United States due to low Arctic air temperature at high enough temperature in the tropics.
Sometimes this combination results in severe temperature variations in a small area.
Such sharp temperature swings will be particularly visible in central US on Sunday.
Between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and in Omah, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and DeMoines, Iowa, there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other areas.
In most of the US central and eastern areas, warm weather is expected in early October, and the temperature will be as high as 27 degrees from the South Plains to the North East.
In New York on Tuesday, the temperature can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast is likely to be extremely high on the east coast of the United States by mid-August.
Judge Britta Cavanaugh's senate hearing saw over 20 million spectators
The testimony of Britta Cavanaugh and Kristina Blazy Ford, who accused Cavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, on Thursday attracted over 20 million viewers of six television channels.
The political stand-off over Cavanaugh's confirmation of his candidacy was unexpectedly continued. On Friday, an urgent media report came in that Republican Jeff Flake made a condition that the charges against a lawyer be investigated by the F.B.I. within a week.
As Ford stated at the hearing before the Sentence's Legal Committee, she was “100 percent” confident that Cavanaugh was in a state of intoxication and had tried to undress her at a school party.
Cavanaugh gave an emotional statement saying that he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's research agency, more than 20.4 million viewers watched Friday's debate.
The agency took into account the average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of audiences of other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network are not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen's ratings do not always take into account the viewers watching TV at work.
By comparison, this is an average audience following the American soccer game in playoffs or the Oscar ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Cavanaugh's appointment: the senate hearing, which lasted all day, saw an average of 5.69 million viewers, reported by Nielsen.
The second is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, and MSNBC watched 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, according to Nielsen.
After the hearing, interest in the case was not weakened.
There was a real drama with Jeff Flake on Friday.
After a Senator from Arizona, considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Cavanaugh's candidacy, CNN and CBS were able to capture the camera, as on Friday morning, on his way to a meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake encountered a group of activists in the elevator who had criticized the senator.
The whole world saw him, looking down, getting bullied by angry women live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," one of them said.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“For you the power, while so many women are powerless,” they tried to explain their position.
Locke replied to activists that his office had already prepared a statement and that he would address the issue at the committee meeting, and the elevator doors had closed, concealing the senator from all-inclusive cameras.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Cavanaugh's candidacy for the post of judge and to send her to the Senate for a general vote, all TV channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Flake set one condition: to investigate the F.B.I. on these charges against a candidate by next week, as a democratic minority sought.
Fleke claims to have changed his mind because of the intervention of a friend, a senator from the Democratics of Chris Coons.
He made the final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Flake's decision had had an effect, as it was evident that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
By decree of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May blames his critics for "politic games" about the Brexit situation.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians criticizing her plan to leave the European Union of placing narrow party interests above the public interest.
The British Prime Minister is attending a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published on the same page as May, former head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Brexit Shock Plan, saying that he considered the introduction of British-European Customs duties to be "absolutely ridiculous."
Wayne Sims' death in an exchange of fire: the police arrested Daemon Simpson on suspicion of murdering a forwarder at the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player playing for the University of Louisiana.
As reported by the Baton-Russ police, 20-year-old Daion Simpson was arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges.
The police released a video of a fight with Simms and Simpson, where Simms lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, the CBS Regional Channel, the police found the DNA of Simpson on the glasses found at the crime scene.
During the questioning, he admitted that he had fatally wounded Wade.
According to the Advocate publication, a bond of US$ 350,000 has been set for Simpson.
The Coroner of the Eastern district of Baton Ruja published a pretrial detention on Friday, due to a cross-fired shot in the neck and head.
The Division thanks the criminal investigation department of the Louisiana State police, the State police crime lab, the University of the South police and the local population, who have helped carry out intelligence activities leading to detention.
Joe Alleve, Director of Sport, University of Louisiana, thanked the police for their “good faith in catching a criminal.”
Simms was only 20 years old.
The two-metre forward was a native of Baton-Rose; his father, Wayne, also played for the University of Louisiana team.
In the last season, Sims scored 5.6 points and averaged 2.6 rebounds per match.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying that the tragic death of Wade Simms had caused a "shock" and a "true grief" for all players.
"That's what I've always been afraid of," added the coach.
The vulcan covered Mexico City's ashes
Popocatepetl fell asleep in the ashes of the southern capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Natural Disasters of Mexico recommended that the population stay away from the volcano: its crater had registered activity and generated 183 steam and gas discharges within 24 hours.
The Centre observed that there was a lot of noise and trembling in the vicinity of the volcano.
In some parts of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko, social media users published photos of frontal glass of cars covered with thin ashes.
After an earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which struck central Mexico in September 2017, geophysics detected an increase in vulcanic activity 72 km south-east of the capital.
The Popocatepetl Vulcan (or, for its own, Don Goio) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Confronted police with Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a multi thousandth meeting was held in Barcelona to mark the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which had split the country into two camps; there had been clashes between the advocates of independence and the police, and six participants had been arrested.
The police pushed the protesting independence activists away, while the latter, wearing black masks, threw eggs and powdered paint at the guards, lifting clouds of dark dust in the very middle of Barcelona.
After the police launched a crowd control baton, the riots resumed with new force.
For a few hours, the advocates of independence chanted, "Let's not forget it, let's not forget it!" and their opponents answered with the motto, "Long live Spain!"
According to local press reports, fourteen participants were hospitalized with slight injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was declared illegal by the Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for the separatists, and a year later, tension remained in a region seeking to become a sovereign.
Catalonia, with a huge majority, voted to withdraw from Spain, but the appearance was low because the opponents of the withdrawal largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, during the past year almost 1,000 people were injured in attempts by the police to block the holding of a referendum at the country's polling stations in violent clashes.
On Friday, the Separatists slept on the declared route of a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration took place anyway, but it took another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended a separatist rally in his wife's company, complains that the hope of Catalonia's acquisition of sovereignty is becoming ever more elusive.
“The past year has been one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents weeped with joy when they were allowed to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a state of hang,” he says.
In the recent December elections for local government, the Catalonian parties that stand for secession from Spain won an important victory, albeit with a slight break, but this year their movement loses its followers, as many of the prominent leaders of the movement are either on the run or in detention awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pouch, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a police rally on the phone, said that the conflict was heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
"The spread of tension," he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in regular elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,” he says.
Londonderry: car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry had been tainted with a car several times; the men in it, aged 33, 34 and 39, had been arrested.
The attack took place on Thursday around 7:30 local time in the Ballingard Cresent district.
As a result, the gate and the building itself were damaged, reported by the police inspector Bob Blemmings.
There were reports that an onion shot might have been fired into the car.
Livingstone's victory over Rangers thanks to Mengi's sharp goal
The first goal of Dolly Mengi was a guaranteed victory for the Livingstone team.
Thanks to a hit ball, Livingstone won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the main coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerrard, this is just the second defeat in 18 games.
The exact strike by Dolly Mengi equals Gary Holt's team to the Hibernian Club in a score table where they share second place.
The Gerrard Club was left without winning the premiere season, and is scheduled to meet with the leaders of the Harts group on Sunday, from which the Rangers are eight points behind.
On Thursday, the Rangers will be playing a European League match with the Austrian Rapid Club in Vienna.
The Livingstone Club continues its winning series in the division, winning six games and having received no defeat since Holt replaced Kennie Miller as the team's main coach.
Lost moments for Livingstone in a struggle with pushy guests
Holt's assistants were supposed to keep the score from the beginning, because the Rangers were clearly failing their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of protection, but the goal of his weak attempt failed, and then Alan Litgoe's defender, waving too wide, couldn't prevent the ball from falling into the net.
The host allowed Rangers to play in front of their protection line, relying on dangerous moments when the game resumed.
That's how they missed that big goal.
The Rangers gave way to a free shot, and Livingstone took the opportunity to send Declan Gallagher and Robinson to Menge, who scored from a central position.
By that time the Rangers had the advantage of owning the ball, but the protection of the host team was invincible, so the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was not concerned.
The second half went on in the same way, although Kelly still had to beat off the crack at Alfredo Morelos.
Allan McGregor kicked the ball off of Scott Pittman, and Litgo made a large pitch from the standard position.
Balls were constantly hit by the Livingstone fine, but all the attacks were reflected, and the two penalties, one for provoking Glenn Middleton's backup player and the other for playing the game, were not satisfied.
Livingstone's "Fennomial" game -- analysis
From BBC Scotland - Alasder Lamont, a report from the Tony Macarony Arena Stadium
A fenomeenal game and a great score for the Livingstone team.
Absolutely all the players were brilliant, and they overcame all expectations again, continuing their climb to the soccer olympus.
Their style of play and composition has not changed much since they got up to the top of the rating, and the great merit of coach Holt is that he has mobilised this team from the beginning.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halquet led a great organized defence, and Menga kept consonant with Goldson and Joe Warall.
At the same time, the Rangers were unable to get back to the rhythm.
Although they had a good game with coach Gerrard, they didn't meet our expectations this time.
In the last few minutes of the match, they did not have enough to own the ball, and they only managed to defend the host team once. The Rangers, which fell down the middle of the table, had a lot to think about.
Cold reception of Erdogan during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, there was a beautiful weather, and both top faces were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish a relationship between the two participating countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a visit already associated with some conflicts.
The heads of countries have not been able to understand human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
He then went to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of a huge new shrine.
The largest Turkish Diaspora outside Turkey lives in Cologne.
For security reasons, the police prevented a 25 000th crowd from entering the Moslem, but many of Erdogan's followers settled nearby to see their President.
There were also opponents of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, to fully condemn both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to Germany.
The existence of radically conflicting views at the meeting reflects the ambiguous nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots exalt Erdogan, while others view him as a tyrant.
Deptford Road crash: crashing a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, a car encountered a cyclist who died at the scene.
An accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Eveline Street, a lively junction in the southeast of Depfort, about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the paramedics who arrived at the site tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without regaining consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just a mile and a half from the scene of the incident, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver had escaped.
The London police report that efforts are under way to identify the victim and to notify the next of kin.
In the meantime, roads are blocked and buses are rerouted, so motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Insomnia in Long-Lartin prison: six police officers wounded
According to the Long-Lartin administration, six police officers were injured during riots committed in a men's high-security prison.
In the Long-Lartin-Ustershire men's maximum security prison, riots have continued since Sunday around 9:30 a.m. local time.
In order to suppress the riots involving eight prisoners from one wing, the Tornado Task Force was called up.
The police officers had suffered minor damage to the soft tissue of the person; they had received medical attention on the ground.
According to the prison official, “specially trained officers were employed to resolve the incident at Long-Lartin Correctional Centre.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the culprits will be handed over to the police and their restraining measure may be changed for a longer period of time.
Long-Lartin currently held over 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, there was a media report that the prison manager had been hospitalized and had been attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the prison management was forced to engage special units to calm the raging prisoners who had thrown biljart balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa could flood Phoenix, Las Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which would benefit drylands)
Arizona rarely enters the area of the intense tropical Cyclone, but this time it has been “lucked”: early next week, Hurricane Rosa, after taking the last leap, must pass over the desert of South West and bring with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already warned about the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and pour out a rainy Monday night.
The Phoenix Bureau of the National Weather Service reported on Twitter that “only ten tropical Cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression, within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 65 km from Arizona's border."
According to recent forecasts by the National Weather Service, it will fall from 5 to 10 cm in precipitation, reaching 15 cm in places on the Mogolon-Rome Plateau.
In other desert regions of South West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, possibly falling up to 2.5 to 5 cm in precipitation, the precipitation can be as high as 10 cm.
For areas overwhelmed by the rains, the rain caused by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, for the region has long suffered from a drought.
While flooding may be dangerous, heavy rains can ease the dry season that does not take place in the South West.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, there is at least a severe drought (the second largest) on over 40% of Arizona's soil,” reports the web site Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane with a maximum speed of 137 km/h lies 360 km south of the town of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane found itself in an area with cooler waters on the Pacific coast and thus lost its power.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico it is expected that there will be massive flooding.
"From Lower California to Northwest Sunora may fall up to 7 to 10 cm in precipitation, up to 25 cm in places," reports the web site Weather.com.
Then Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico and early Tuesday morning will reach the border with Arizona in the tropical Cyclone category, from Arizona to South Utah by Tuesday night.
"The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rose and its remnants is the heavy rains in Lower California, Northwest Sunora and the deserted parts of South West America," reports the National Weather Service.
It is expected that the precipitation will result in dangerous flooding, dirt flows in the desert and possible land slides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Northon: four suspects arrested for attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was seriously stabbed and three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton on about 4 a.m. Saturday morning.
After hospitalization, his condition is considered to be “stability.”
On the same night, four suspects were arrested in the Radstock district, aged 17, 18 and 20, reporting to the Avon and Somerset County police.
The police are searching for possible witnesses of a crime who have any video of what happened on their mobile phone.
"On Cavanaugh, all the hatred, all the anger of the democrats"
“The voice for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the democrats,” Trump said at a rally of his companions in Wiling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, during the process of nominating Cavanaugh to a candidate, all the hatred, all the anger of the Democratic Party broke out.
On Thursday, Cavanaugh gave a statement to the U.S. Congress, in his emotional treatment categorically rejecting the accusation of Christina Blazey Ford that he had sexual assaulted her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also gave evidence during her trial.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that "the American people saw Cavanaugh's brilliant mind, class, and courage that day."
“The voice for the statement of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for the approval of one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, with an unconscionable public record,” announced the President to a crowd of his companions in the state of West Virginia.
In his speech, the President had indirectly raised the issue of Cavanaugh's nomination, referring to the importance of the Republicans' being present for elections to the Congress and the House of Representatives.
“The most important elections in our lives are only five weeks away.
I'm not part of them, but I'm part of the race in a different way," he said.
"I wear like a burnt-out and fight for our excellent candidates."
Trump believes that the democrats have set themselves the task of “with their utmost efforts to resist us.”
According to the regulations, the first key vote in the Senate to approve Cavanaugh's candidacy should take place no later than Friday, was announced by the Assistant High-level Spokesman of the Republican Party.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of casualties continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had lost their lives, and many had lost their lives in huge waves that had seized the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which had been hit by an incredible earthquake and a tsunami.
The first victims were hundreds of visitors to a beach festival in the city of Palau, and on Friday, at sundown, the coast struck waves of nearly six meters high, which squashed everything on their way and led to the sudden death of many of those present.
The tunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was issued yesterday, people continued their beach vacation instead of immediately fleeing to shelter and thus lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority during a press conference held in Jakarta.
"Tuns didn't come one, there were cars in the water stream, bricks, whole houses, the elements destroyed everything on their way," explained Nugroho, adding that the ocean had crossed at a speed of 497 km/h and collapsed violently on the coast.
Some of those present climbed the trees, saving their lives.
Some 16 700 locals were evacuated in 24 refuges in Palau.
Aerophobics of the Disaster Management Authority show destroyed houses, shops, broken bridges and a flooded mob.
On Saturday, the coast town was still shaken by an underground tremor.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The statement of the Technology Evaluation Agency of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) stated that the earthquake-induced energy release was about 200 times greater than the explosion of the atomic bomb that had destroyed Hiroshima.
Perhaps the tsunami was stronger than expected because of the geographical location of the city at the end of the long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “large-scale”, adding that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
Under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the bodies of the dead were found; 540 people were injured and 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho added that damage and destruction could be even more significant along the coast to 300 km from Palau, in a location near the epicentre of the earthquake in Dungal.
Communication with Dungal was “totally destroyed, no information was received”.
“There are over 300,000 people living in the Dungal area,” reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its Communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already gone to the disaster zone.
"There has been a tragedy, but it's not the limit," says the report.
On Saturday, the Authority was severely criticized because it did not report the arrival of a tsunami in Palau on time; however, the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
There was a amateur video on social media in which a man on the top floor of the building was shouting about an imminent tsunami, desperately trying to attract the attention of people on the street.
After a few minutes, a wall of water collapses on the shore, carrying entire houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
Earthquake and the Tsunami have caused a major loss of electricity, resulting in the loss of communications in Palau, which has made rescue operations very difficult.
From Jakarta and other cities, military transport aircraft were shipped with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuees still lack food and basic supplies and are reported by government sources.
The airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Vidodo will visit the Palau Evacuation Center on Sunday.
The number of casualties in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity arrived safely from Dungal to Palau, where employees found shelter in tarpaulins that had been smashed in the courtyard of their office building, and said the Sinai Dossa had shown a dreadful picture of total destruction on their way.
"They've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charities have begun to activate humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many have complained that international NCBs have not managed to get to Palau.
Indonesian law only allows for the financing, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations to be engaged after the declaration of a disaster-stricken location as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that this is a local disaster,” reports Auliya Ariani, Spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares a natural disaster to be a national disaster, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but so far the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Pale, friends and relatives of those who are reported to be missing still hope for their wonderful salvation, which will restore people's faith in the best.
On Saturday a little boy was rescued who fell into the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers extracted a woman from the wreckage of the building who had spent two days there, near her mother's inhaled body.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national para-planetry coach, trained two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among the other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
"I'm not the last person in this sport, and it's emotionally difficult to survive," he said.
Gendon remembers that, when he learned of the collapse of Roa's hotel from other paralyzers, he was desperately trying to contact whatsApp with his colleagues in Palau at the beach festival within the next few hours.
However, his messages were shown with one gray tick instead of two blue ones.
“It means that no messages have been delivered,” he considers.
A violent theft of US$ 26,750 while maintaining an ATM in Newport-on-Livi
On Friday morning, the intruders stole 26,750 dollars from Brink's ATM account manager in Newport-on-Livy, as reported in a press release by the Newport police.
The driver of the armoured minibus took the cash from an ATM located in the entertainment complex and was about to fill it with new notes.
At that time, "Brink's employee ran off his back by an intruder" and stole a bag of bills to refill the ATM.
According to witnesses of the incident, several suspects had escaped from the scene of the crime, but the police had not indicated the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information about these persons are requested to contact the Newport police station at number 859 to 292 to 3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Yee
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Yee.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, a 41-year-old, has long worn this pseudonym and even named it as his eighth album, which was released in June.
News of this appeared in anticipation of Kanye's appearance in the Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new album by Yandhi.
Kanye West will act as co-host instead of Ariana, who has cancelled her engagement because of her "emotional experiences," reports the author of the broadcast.
West had previously argued that the pseudonym was not only a shortened version of his name, but also a religious one.
"Ye, the most common word in the Bible, means you, you," West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with Big Boy.
"I mean, I'm you, I'm us.
At first there was Kanye, which means "the only one," and now I'm just Yee, which is the reflection of all the good, bad, incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to understand who we are."
Kanye wasn't the first known rapper to decide to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deady, Pi Diddy or just Diddy, has this year asked to be called Love ("love") or Braza Love ("Bruder Love" or "Bruder Love").
He also changed his name several times with West's rapper, with a defiance and without capital letters or lower letters.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military force against the civilian population
President Andres Manuel López Obrador of Mexico vowed never to resort to military force against the civilian population in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which ended with a bloody collision.
On Saturday in Tlatelloco Square, President López Obrador promised to “never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration, students shot first at the crowd and began a carnage that killed 300 people, a situation which occurred in the context of the growing left student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also pledged support to Mexican youth in the form of a monthly study grant and the opening of more free public universities.
He said that joblessness and lack of educational prospects led young people directly into the criminal world.
US needs to double funding for ISI development
China and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence should not be underestimated: the US should double its investment in its research, as Lee Kaifu, an investor and an ISI developer with experience at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Formerly, several U.S. Departments have made statements on the ISI, although the U.S. generally does not have a clear strategy for the ISI.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in the innovation of the AI by 1930.
“The doubling of the IE research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we expect the next breakthrough in II,” says Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big achievement of the AI will be made in the US, said Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director-general of the Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent ISI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that overcame the highest player in Othello, and then he was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous US government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge agency Defense Advance Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
"Not China absorbs academic leaders, but corporations," Li is convinced.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing university lights in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the US develop artificial intelligence.
"I think Green Cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence," he says.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to develop artificial intelligence for the next generation.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to researchers in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, says Li.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence had set up a United Centre for Artificial Intelligence, in which partners from industry and the scientific community should participate, and the White House had announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in ISI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which sought to establish the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has not taken any action in this direction for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether or not to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for European Union and NATO.
Greece, of which Macedonia is a province, claims that its northern neighbour's name is a claim on its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June both governments concluded an agreement based on a new name, but national opponents argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonians.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the turnout would be at the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a contract with Greece?”
Proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay that price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament had stated that they would abide by the results of the vote in order to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
Changing the name will require a two-thirds majority of members of Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no abuses had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I've come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," says 62-year-old Yosa Tanevski, a voters from the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumitz, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Cavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene, breaking chairs in front of the tents set by those citizens who are about to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to merge with our high-headed, rather than surging the thresholds of the cabinets,” says Kowadarkov.
"Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-esteem.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zayev said that joining NATO would bring about investments in Macedonia, which were so needed by that country, where the rate of unemployment was more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” said Zayev after the vote.
He believes that a positive answer will be a “leave for our prosperous future”.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would take part in the referendum, but that this was below the required appearance.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel found that 57 per cent of the respondents were scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 per cent said they would vote positively.
For a referendum to take place, it must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western Government since it came to power last May.
Look: Sergei Aguiero of the Manchester City runs around Briton's protection to score a goal.
Sergei Aguiero and Raheem Sterling lost their protection to Briton, leading the Manchester City to a victory at 2:0 on Saturday at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguiero scored a goal for the 65th minute, it seemed as if it were no trouble for him.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker got a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between the three Briton advocates before breaking into open space.
Aguiero was surrounded by four rivals in green t-shirts.
He passed one defender and overcame a few more on the edge of the Briton penalty zone.
He then handed Sterling the ball to the left.
The English attacker, while in the penalty zone, put in one touch the Aguero ball, which hit the Briton gatekeeper Matthew Ryan's right corner of the gateway with his right foot.
"Aguero is having some problems with his legs," said a coach to the press, "Monchester City," by Pep Guardiola.
"We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky-Blue an initial advantage in the struggle of the Prime League.
That goal was full for the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero got a ball deep inside Briton.
He gave a great cut-off on the left flank on Leroy Sana.
Sanae made a few references before handing Sterling over to a long-distance trout.
The attacker, the Sky-Blue, shot the ball at the gate just before flying outside the field.
The Manchester City fought with Hoffhenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 on the Rhine-Neqcar-Arene League in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to take the glasses from Colorado Rockies
After the Washington Nationals emerged from the battle for the playoffs, there was no reason to push events.
But the inexorable Sherzer hopes to win the fight against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who are ahead of one Los Angeles Dodgers game in the Western Division, have problems in playoffs.
The 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, the Rockies won at least 7 or 8th place, but they still hope to secure their title in the first division.
"And while we're playing for nothing, at least we can keep our positions, knowing the immense importance of the Denver atmosphere in front of the audience and the other team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?"
The Nationals have not announced the pitcher on Sunday, but the latest evidence suggests that Sherzer is inclined to play this role.
Sherzer, about to go to the 34th game, threw a ball on Thursday at the pitcher's playground, and on Sunday, on his day off, he'll be a pitcher.
Statistics from the Washington Rubber were 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 out of 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
Trump's holding an election race in West Virginia
With regard to the importance of the Republicans appearing at the interim elections, the President had implicitly referred to the situation surrounding Britta Cavanaugh, a candidate submitted by the President to the Supreme Court.
"All that we did was at stake in November.
Five weeks left to one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, though I'm really running around fighting for good candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using all necessary means, and we see vileness and abhorrentness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, which is what they want -- power and control, but we're not going to give them."
The democrats, he claims, were intended to “oppose and prevent”.
"And you've been watching this for the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "villain, vile, vile and false."
He referred to the senate's Juridical Committee, referring to Senator-Democrat Diane Feinstein, which caused loud calls from the hall.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the contents of this document?
Um... uh... what document?
No, no, the body language gave it away, I've never seen the body language so disprove the words."
The labor party is no longer a multi-minded organization.
It does not tolerate those who express their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party offered a vote of mistrust to me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last member of Parliament from a labour party who has not yet been commended for expressing our views.
That's also true of my colleague, Joan Ryan, because she was strongly opposed to anti-Semiticism.
In my case, a vote of distrust has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, and Europe are ironically matters on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham Eastern Labour Assembly notification on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the labor party's Friday evening GC meetings have been like this.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not in line with many meetings, and the promise of a “more human and soft” policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
The fact that there are no differences of opinion in the labour party is becoming more and more evident, and each opinion is evaluated as to whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own began to expect that I would radically change my views and take a position that I would never agree with — whether national security or a single EU market.
Every time I speak in public -- no matter what I say -- social networks have a tirade of insults that call for the revocation of elections that condemn the centre's policy, or that say I shouldn't be a member of the labor party.
And that's not just happening to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments to me still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face daily sexual or racist attacks, but never retreat.
What is most frustrating about this policy is that such a number of insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the labor party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the "broad church," and with every vote of mistrust or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes a party.
Over the past two years, I've received a lot of recommendations that encourage me to sit still and cut my voice, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the labourers 32 years ago, as a student of the school, outraged by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which has literally caused my school class to collapse, I have sought to maintain the highest standard of public services for those who need it most, whether it be the work of a local deputy or a government minister.
I've never concealed my political views, I've never done it in the last election.
No one in Nottingham could misunderstand my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: our country is so hard on the way to Brexit, which will guarantee economic, industrial and public damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and energy on the question of my allegiance to the leader of the labour party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Movement, but my voters, whether or not they are laborers: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that any threats to cancel elections or political expediency will not prevent me from acting as I consider necessary in your interests.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible Er comes first
The two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but the "Er" no doubt earned a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Tentent premiere match.
Now they're leading a table, the only invincible team of tens.
After all, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as their ability to choose the right moment, which gave Peter Merchi's host team and coach the right to be satisfied.
"All this time we've been tested for strength, and we're still invincible, so I don't have any reason to be sad," Peter Merchi remarked.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's good to pay tribute to "Ear," they've done better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fraser Climo led the "Ear" forward, but the yellow card released for the Warriors game by the Scottish player, Roary Hughes, allowed the Melrose to move forward, and Jason Buggott caught up with the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased the "Ear" break from the penalty before, right in the middle of the game, earning a point and then during the break, making a single attempt, making score 17-5 in favour of the "Ear".
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Buggot reduced the break to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the severe strain on Ruarid Knott, who had been stretched, and after re-entry, the "Er" went on with the attempt by Stafford McDowell, executed by Klimo.
Current Captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose forced the opponents to pay another player for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt at the end of a violent period of pressure.
However, the owners returned, and when Strawan Hatchinson got a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the penalty line, MacPherson made a touchdown behind the coming Moul "Ear".
Climo realized an advantage without stopping almost after the very re-entry, after Kyle Rowe got hit by David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's extreme assailant to the fifth attempt by the landlords.
Star Still Game is about to start a new career in the restaurant business.
Star Still Game Ford Kieran is about to start work in the hotel industry, and it has become known that he has been appointed director of a licensing restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he writes to, and is filmed with a long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphyll.
The duo announced that the coming 9th episode would be the last on the show, and it looks like Kirnan is planning a life after Craigslist.
Officially, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the Scottish Sun source hinted that Kirnan was planning to take part in the "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": a sea-free Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
The seamen are pacing the Navy in La Paz.
Blue flags are hung up on public buildings.
The navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked with a motto: "The sea is our right.
It is our duty to return it."
Throughout Bolivia, the coastline, lost in Chile as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century over resources, is still alive; the desire to sail again across the Pacific.
These hopes have perhaps become the most bold in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of an international court on 1 October, which will take place after five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of union, and a mental balance and, of course, a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomatic Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the high screen verdict of the International Court of Justice throughout the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia's statement that, after decades of intense negotiation, Chile has a duty to pursue the negotiation of Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is waging a difficult struggle for re-election next year, is also anxiously awaiting a decision to be made on Monday.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if so, it will change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands had no power to control Chilean territory and had already stated that it would have no effect on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was rendered only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case was “not complicated,” says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And for the past four years the Bolivian case has not progressed, and vice versa it has been delayed all the time.
“The current Bolivian government has used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate says.
She said that Morales' military rhetoric had destroyed the last Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile would at some point continue the talks, but after that it would be extremely difficult to engage in discussions.
These two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduard Rodriguez Velce, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagreed that the court's decision had been delivered too quickly.
Monday will provide Bolivia with an “exceptional opportunity to begin a new era of interaction with Chile” and a chance to “end the 139 years of differences with mutual benefit”, he claims.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the marine problem as a political asset.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he claims.
“The court's decision is an opportunity to make sure once again that we have to go through our past.”
North Korea declares that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho states that his country will never destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called upon the United States to honour the promises made at the Singapore summit between its leaders.
His comments are being received as US secretary Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of resuming stalled nuclear diplomatic activity more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Eun in Singapore.
Ree claims that the dream that the long-term sanctions and US objections to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever put the North on its knees is a utopia.
Washington fears the adoption of this declaration if Pyongyang does not take substantial steps to achieve disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But the scepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the abandoning of the armoury, which the country probably views as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows the latest line of massive headwear that promises to appear in the mass sale, and they'll be worn right next to you.
If you want to add your hats to your collection or completely protect yourself from sunlight, there's no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentinino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusual head-cleanings that form part of their SS19 collection and blinded fashion week visitors in Paris.
This summer, very impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their stunning creatures to the runway.
A distinct executable of Valentino: the head beige jacket, decorated with broad feather-like fields, was painted on model heads.
Other massive accessoires included precious watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples, but all of these hats are not designed to warm their heads in cold weather.
Tom Brown also presented the world with a collection of fancy masks, which had to be very close to the eve of Halloween.
Many of these squirrel masks had their mouth shut, and they looked more like Hannibal's portrait of the lecturer than the couture.
One of them looked like underwater equipment with pipes and sunglasses, while the other looked like melting ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're lucky.
Mode critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of getting into mass sales -- directly to you.
The huge hats follow the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a two-foot wide field, all of which have been worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The Cult label, which released this extremely impractical hat, which gained so much popularity on social media, produced and sent a walk on the runway to another huge accessoire, a straw-bag beach bag, almost as large as the bathing-room model itself carrying this bag.
An orange bag of burned raffia with a white leather handle and a rabbit cap became a bright copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, a celebrity stencilist, says to FEMAIL: "I think big hats and beach bags will appear in a mass sale next summer, as a designer has made such a fuss with his works, it would be very difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessoires."
John Edward: Language skills are of great importance to citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools continue to have a tradition of brilliant education, as confirmed again in 2018: outstanding exams have shown individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other social subjects.
These schools are part of the Scottish Independent Schools Board (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland are trained, and seek to provide the highest level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, career choices and status as citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the design and implementation of the individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you call on his mind.
If you speak to him in his native tongue, you turn to his heart."
It is a strong evidence that we cannot rely only on English if we want to interact with and trust the citizens of other countries.
From the recent exams of this year, we see that languages take the lead in the League tables and have the highest score in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of foreign-language students received a higher score of A.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students had received "A" in Mandarin (in Chinese), while 72 per cent of students in German, 69 per cent of students in French and 63 per cent of students in Spanish had also received "A".
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland foreign languages are certainly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Language subjects now enjoy the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Jobs and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill vacant jobs were due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming more and more the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of profession a student chooses, if he learns a second language, he will in the future have a real advantage by learning another additional skill that he will benefit from throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of YouTube, in which more than 4,000 British adults took part in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak well enough in a foreign language to support conversations, while French was the only language with two digits, with 15 percent of the respondents speaking it.
That's why investment in language education is so relevant now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of countries with emerging economies, would give children a better chance of finding a good job.
There is a wide variety of languages in Scotland's schools that are taught, with each school having a different set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to Britain in the light of the country's future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with teachers, whose members are professionals in those languages.
Independent schools in Scotland seek to create an educational environment that will train children and provide them with the skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of their future.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, providing a variety of opportunities and benefits for young people in Scotland.
Il faunt byen le fire.
John Edwards, Director, Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron debuts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The worrisome expectation of fans to see LeBron James speak for the first time at the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
"Lakers" coach Luke Walton announced that James would play a pre-season Sunday match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still have to figure out how long it's gonna take.
"More than one or less than forty-eight," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a short time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games on the Lakers chart.
"I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the season at this stage of my career," the player replied.
Trump's Pre-election in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of election meetings tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five scheduled meetings of Trump next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the candidacy he had offered for the position of Chief Justice had been postponed, Trump sought support for the upcoming interim elections, since the Republicans risked losing control of the Congress if the vote was held in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wiling, West Virginia, will take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting with West Virginia voters online on live YouTube.
Trump will probably appear at the hearing this week in order to nominate his candidate, Brett Cavanaugh, for the position of Chief Justice; the Trump's offer of this candidacy has led to a lot of negative reactions, as Cavanaugh has been accused of sexual harassment, and the vote to be held in the senate will be postponed for a period of up to a week while the Fed is conducting an investigation.
But the main goal of this action is to help the Republicans who are going to the November elections to accelerate the pace of elections.
So President Trump's campaign is to make sure that these five meetings, which are due to take place next week, help to “energize the activities of volunteers and advocates, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” writes Reuters.
“Control of the Congress is so important to its agenda that the President should visit as many states as possible, since we are entering a tense campaign season,” says the Trump campaign spokesperson, who refused to be called, Reuters.
Planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wiling, the campaign can attract followers from "...Ohio and Pennsylvania, and the media in Pittsburgh," reports West Virginia Metro News.
The West Virginia Trump visit this Saturday is the second visit to the state in the last month, where it gained an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's senator Patrick Morris, who is behind in the polls.
"The fact that in order for Morris to get ahead of the poll competitors is that the president must come -- that's not a good sign for Morris himself," says Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia (citus from Reuters).
Rider Cup 2018: US Team shows readiness and hopes for Sunday's match
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday game was probably exactly what the Rider Cup needed.
The rolling initiative is an extraordinary fancy sporting concept, but it's what players believe in, and it's particularly pronounced in such competitions.
So who's taking the initiative?
"They had an advantage of six points, and now four, so I suppose for us this is a small initiative," said Jordan Spit while he left.
Of course, Europe has a four point advantage, and twelve more are at stake.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel the wind in sails, and they have reason to keep the spirit high, not least because of the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and each one can boast with three out of four points.
Sleeping was constant from you to the green, and it was a personal example.
The winning shouts became louder as his round continued, throwing the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas gave up two by two.
His blow, which gave them a victory in the game on the 15th Hole, was met with a similar shout, one of those that speaks of his belief in a chance for the American team.
"We need to get together and focus only on our own game," remarked Spit.
That's all the players have left.
Walk through 18 holes and become winners.
The only players who have earned more points over the past two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have undoubtedly entered the history of the Rider Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe beat four out of four, and they don't seem to know the mistakes.
Moliwood was the only couple who didn't get a godgie on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided a godga on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.
This series, and the way their energy seems to be circulating between them and violent fans, reinforces the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the horizon of the "Le Golf National" field, there will be no more famous player who anchors Europe's potential victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be great if both were on different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about Europe's glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Sampson quickly ended up with Sergei Garcia, the four-ball morning hero when he was in a match with Alex Norén.
The boggs and the two double boggs on the first nine holes dug a Spanish and a Swedish pit from which they were never able to get out.
So on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
It's so exciting to watch a four-ball game and a four-player game because of the interaction between the pairs, the tips they exchange, and who deliberately keep quiet, and how the strategy can change in a moment.
So far Europe has played better as a team, and it's made a lot of progress on the last day, but this four-man session has also shown that the US team has the strength to fight, in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Rider Cup Europe leads with a score of 10-6
Europe will gain a significant advantage on the final day of the Rider Cup after the completion of the four-ball and four-ball Saturday match with a 10-six over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against the two victories of the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the bill to "Le Golf National" to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to regain the lost trophy in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team's making mistakes in four-ball morning games, winning 3-1.
The US has shown more resistance in the fours, winning two matches, but has not been able to close the gap.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points from the 12 Sunday matches to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European freshman to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, were only the second pair, who won four points in the first four games in the history of the Rider Cup.
By smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into four balls, they then reunited perfectly to defeat the fallen Woods and American newer Bryson Detchmo with even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who had completed two Saturday matches, had a recurring glimpse, but he now lost 19 of the 29 games with four balls and a quarter with seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested before the four-ball morning game, returned to his four-year-old partner Henrik Stanson, defeating Dustin Johnston and Brooks Cup with a score of 2/1, ranked first and third in the world.
For Europe, the game did not become an easy and pleasant walk of refreshing day southwest of Paris.
Made by the three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points became a guide for Americans.
They won a strong 2/1 victory against the Spanish John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory Macilroy with a 4/3 score in fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Rider Cup did the team get out of a four-point gap, coming out alone, considering that Ferrik's team, as masters, needed to play a single game to keep the trophy alive.
However, after two days of holding second place, the counterattack seems to be beyond their capabilities on Sunday.
North Korea says that “kategoryly” will not be disarmed on a one-sided basis without confidence
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs said to the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions increased the mistrust of the United States and that his country would under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Young Ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantled nuclear testing and a commitment not to increase nuclear weapons stocks or develop nuclear technologies.
"But we don't see a symmetrical reaction from the US," he said.
“Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to be the first to take action on disarmament.”
While Ri repeated North Korean complaints about Washington's “stage” approach to deducularization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for incremental steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject a one-sided deunciation without control, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ree referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the US President-in-Office and the North Korean leader, which was held in Singapore on 12 June; Kim then promised to launch a movement towards the “declaration of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States states that Pyongyang must abandon its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls for the relaxation of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that “first deuclarization must take place” and increases pressure through sanctions to force it to achieve its goal and even objects to “the declaration of the end of the war”, says Ree.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is the utopian dream of people who don't know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions increase our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae In over the past five months and added: “If South Korea, rather than the United States, were a party to the issue of deuclarization, the deuclarization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in such a standstill.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was sharply different from that of last year when he said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea's rocket targets on the United States mainland were inevitable after the “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim the “suicide rocket.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who threatened to “destruct completely” North Korea last year, commended Kim for his courage to take action on disarmament, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this process: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, US secretary Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's implementation of sanctions must continue actively and necessarily until we see a complete, final and confirmed declaratoryization."
The Security Council has steadily increased its sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in an effort to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rie in the margins of the UN General Assembly and announced after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second Summit.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea had condemned him for “bang demands”.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the rocket complex as well as the nuclear complex, should the United States take the appropriate measures.
According to Kim, the “appropriate measures” he spoke of were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions designed to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest in special classes
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, has helped all primary students to learn to sleep more and to fight the chauvinist culture of uninterrupted caffeine use in order to stay awake “night-long.”
One of the researchers found that the world's most successful students often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Briggham and Women's Hospital, developed a course which he considered to be the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he was excited to introduce such a course by making a report on the impact of sleep shortage on learning processes.
"At the end of my presentation, a girl came to me and said, 'I'm sorry I only found out now that I'm about to finish my studies.'
She said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which was first offered to students this year, shows how healthy sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, and how it improves overall human health.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University's Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after it had been determined that students had serious sleep problems during the school week.
The hours are one hour, and the students perform a series of interactive tasks.
One section of the classroom provides an image of a room in a dormitory where students, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, simulators and books, learn how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, which causes a lack of sleep — affect sports performance and how important it is to get enough sleep daily.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive computer map encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
"We understand that these classes will not change the behaviour of the students at once.
But we believe that they have a right to know, like any other person has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects their health," added Professor Chesler.
He said that a false sense of pride for being able to “smell all night” is still common, and modern technology, as well as increasing pressure on students, means that sleeplessness is becoming a problem.
He said that enough sleep of good quality is the student's “secret weapon” to deal with stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to deal with overweight, because under-slapping puts the brain into hunger, making it constantly hungry.
So, a 19-year-old Californian researcher in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop a course by attending one of his lessons last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to disseminate this information all over the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to take a similar curriculum before going to a competitive school.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students set up an alarm clock to warn them that they should go to bed and wake up, and that they be aware of the negative effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which disrupt human biometrics and lead to problems of sleep.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: The goal of Menga wins over the Gerrard team
The Rangers experienced another sad retreat, as the goal of Dolly Meng led the unassembled team of Stephen Gerrard to a 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team hoped to win their first victory on their way out after winning a 4:1 win in St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team only defeated Gerrard of 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving an easy victory to the Harts team, the Scottish Prime League leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who had lost their temper, did not seem to intend to equalize the score.
While Rangers has now dropped to number six, Livingstone has risen to number three, and only Hibernian has given way to the ratio of beaten heads.
And Rangers may have additional problems after the linear judge Kalum Spence had to heal his head after some object had been thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight replacements for the team that passed through the "Ear" to the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt went along with Livia's 11 strategy, which increased the gap with the Harts last week, and he would be pleased to see how his well-stressed composition pushed the opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have led the way in the possession of the sword, but Livingstone pressed much more when the ball hits them.
They were supposed to score a goal in just two minutes, when the first transfer of Meng to Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the half defender took the chance.
Keegan Jacobs executed a fine blow against Captain Craig Hullett, but his defence partner, Alan Litgo, was only able to send the ball to the farest trouser.
The Rangers intercepted control, but in the last third there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he should have struck the penalty for forty-five minutes when he and Stephen Lawless collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept the Colombian application.
The Rangers had only hit two in the first half, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about the hit by Lassan Kulibali's head and the weak hit by Ovi Ejaria.
Although Livy's first goal, struck for the 34th minute, may not match the game, no one can deny that they have earned it entirely by their own work.
But again, the Rangers failed to cope with the Jacobs game from a standard position.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who was trying hard to get the ball to Meng for completion.
Gerrard began to act during the break when he changed the Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and this replacement almost immediately yielded the result when the extreme half defender passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to intercept.
But Livingstone continued to drag guests into a game they were planning with Litaud and Halquett, constantly making long shows.
Holt's team was trying to extend the break-out in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Litgoe handed it over from the corner of the field.
The reserve player at the Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a fine blow after he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor
And now our "Sunday Morning" page: September 30, 1882, and that day, a future physicist named Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
As one of the foundations of science, Geiger's meter became also one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s "Colonado Bell" film, with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who seem to be unlike scientists, in the main roles:
Man: "What the hell is this thing?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like Uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms caused by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Here, I can hear you right now!"
The Gans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But its invention, named after its author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" abnormal cells
A new anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" abnormally growing cells and kill them
Part of the cure is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells
The method is to extract the patient's immune cells and change them in laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, cells have the ability to “see” the type of protein that is typical of many types of cancer, and then the cells have to be rediscovered.
Test-vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One patient whose immune system has learned to detect anomalous cells has been receiving ovarian cancer for over 18 months.
The method is to extract the patient's immune cells and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can "see" HER2 proteins that are common to many types of cancer, then the modified cells are re-introduced to the patient.
Professor J. Berzoofski, U.S. National Institute for Research on Cancer, Bethland, Maryland, states: "The results we have received suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
Professor Berzoofski explains: HER2 "stimulates the growth of multiple types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorful cancer.
A similar method was used successfully in the treatment of protein, which consisted of taking immunocells from patients and teaching them how to affect cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in his MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
It went bad.
Kanye West was released to the studio during a Saturday concert at which he spoke in defence of US President Donald Trump, arguing that he would resume his position in 2020.
After performing his third song, "The City Ghost," which he put on his "Make America Great Again" cap, the performer gave a speech against the democrats and supported Trump.
"Very often I talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I'd have left America long ago," the performer said.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Daemon in the main role in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Britta Cavanaugh's testimony to the senate's Trial Committee on claims of sexual harassment by Christina Blacey Ford.
TV did not show how the crowd was outraged by West's speech, but the video was uploaded on social media by a comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make West laugh.
In addition, West complained to the public that his hat had been ridiculed behind the scenes.
"They were making fun of me behind the stage.
They say don't come out in that hat.
They were really messing with me!
Washington Examiner quotes: "They also said that my position is not cool."
West continues, "Do you want to know what's not cool? Put on a superman's coat so nobody can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to develop?
Then you need love."
At least twice his comments attracted audience attention, members of the SNL acting team seemed confused, and one person said to the publisher, "The entire studio is in silence."
Westa was invited at the last moment to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMeeler, had died a few days before.
Many were puzzled by the West's performance of the song "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservatory group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest people: SERVANT TO SUPPORT THE MlNG."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was just "who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I don't want to support anyone (buying his music, clothes, or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my opinion, shares and spreads an ideology that is bad for my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name by saying that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddie's footsteps, also known as Puff Duddy, Puffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Dog, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and another example is of course an artist who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted murder charge due to scissors at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds on Friday in a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
The incident took place in Bullikhacomor, as reported by the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Peace Court on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Keith Harington, the star of the Game of the Thrones, is attacking a poisonous mask.
Keith Harington is known for his role as the swinging sword of John Snow in the cruel medieval HBO Hearts Game.
However, recently a 31-year-old actor critically criticized the stereotype of a hero-macho, saying that such characters often induce young people to think that to be respected, you must be violent.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to solve the problem of poisonous masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Keith, who recently married a fellow film "The Game of thrones", Rose Lesley, a peer, admitted that he was "fully passionate" about the problem.
"I take this question quite seriously, where did we get the wrong perception of courage?" the actor asked.
"What do we teach young people that we have such a problem today?"
Keith thinks that TV can be partly responsible for this swagger of poisonous masculineness because of too muscular characters.
The actor goes on to say, "What's born and what's acquired?
What does that mean on television and on the streets, making young men feel like they should only have one certain aspect of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because there's really something wrong with young people today.
In an interview he also confessed that he would not be involved in any of the spells or sequels of the Game of thrones after the series ended next summer, saying that he had "finalized the battles and the horses."
Since November, Keith will play a major role in the re-entered "The True West" by Sam Shepard, who talks about the film's production and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believed that meeting Rose's wife was the best finale of the Game of thrones for him.
"I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my life," says the actor.
Rose played the Player, the subject of the passion of the character Keith John Snow in a fantasy show, won by Emmy.
The couple celebrated a wedding in June 2018 at the Lesley family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens affected by HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, diseases were transmitted by sex, indicating a change in trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infection.
However, the number of cases of HIV infection in this way was almost zero, and Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
The sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997 but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women because of the country's conservative values.
In many cases, transmission is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denied information about the leak of information about the fault of the Republican Senators, complaining of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday that one of its employees had posted personal information to three U.S. Republican Senators on the Wikipedia of Lawmakers.
The L.A. democracy claims that the claims were forged by ultra-right experts and websites.
"Leave, lies, and even more vile lies," Waters tweets.
It is reported that published information includes home addresses and telephone numbers of US senators.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the hearing of the senate commission on sexual harassment charges against a candidate in the Supreme Court of Britta Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after three senators interviewed Cavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identify the source of the message was connected to Waters' office and published information about Waters' employees, reports Hill.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false,” Waters assures us.
“A member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these frauds, was in no way responsible for the diversion of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a complete lie."
Waters' statement immediately sparked criticism on the Internet, including by former White House Spokesman Ari Fleisher.
"It's an angry denial," writes Fleisher.
“This means that the author has a temper that is not suitable for working in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be angry?
You don't have to excuse yourself either.
And you shouldn't be digging into the motives of the prosecution either.
We must remain calm and cold."
Fleisher seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters' place in the interim elections, also made his point on Twitter.
"If that's true, it's very important," he writes.
In his statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these frauds.
“We will make sure that the criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which may be devastating and dangerous to all of my employees.”
Johnny English strikes again--a weak impression on Rowan Atkinson's spy.
Nowadays, it is a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which Britain appears in one way or another; this is also true of the new "Agent Johnny English" spies, which began production in 2003 and continued in 2011 with "Agent Johnny English: Rebooting".
Will a self-inflicted picture of the "we're all shit" as a new national export attempt?
At any rate, Johnny English, a blind-eyed profan with a rubber face, got his right to chaos for the second time -- his name, most notably, suggests that he is a broadscreen comical creature designed for a non-English film audience.
The hero, of course, is a dull secret agent who, despite his fancy claims for a glamorous smoothie, got a bit of Clouseau, Mr. Bean's features, and a porter of this guy, who put one single note in the Chariots of Fire tune in London 2012 at the opening ceremony.
Originally, this character was formed on the basis of the identity of the traveller and the mysterious international Atkinson, who once played in the forgotten television advertisement Barclaycard, in which the hero left behind a complete chaos.
There's one or two nice moments in this last issue of the JE.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the splashes popped over his hat.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift to physically perform comedy scenes, but humor itself seems rather weak and strangely unnecessary, especially because “serious” movies such as Agent 007 and Mission Impossible are now firmly offering comedy as an element.
It feels like humor is designed for children, not for adults, and for me, Johnny English's bizarre villains are not as inventive and appropriate as Atkinson's jokes in Mr. Beene's movies.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Kiber-hacker broke into a top secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the duty agent, Kevin Eldon, here, unfortunately, had an occasional role to play.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, a pompous and violent figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best for the character Quasi-Terreza-May, but there's nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence counsel told her that since each active spy had been compromised, she would have to remove someone from retirement.
Here comes the clumsy Johnny English himself, who now works as a school teacher in some fancy establishment, but also provides informal lessons on secret operations: there are a few good jokes here, because English offers the skills of the "rock" spy Academy.
English is going back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his former unlucky friend Buff, who is playing by Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man, under the command of a submarine, who plays the role of a jolly hockey club, in which Vicky Pepperdin is lost a little.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because Her Majesty's secret service has made some terrible mistakes, and they're encountering a beautiful, fatal woman named Ophelia Bulletova in the performance of Olga Curilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic technological billionaire, who claims to be able to solve British computer problems -- the ominous Jason Volta, who Jake Lacey plays.
Inglish and Buff are starting their hunch with farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggled themselves on the luxury boat of Volt; and they create a constant anarchy, trying to use the virtual reality garnish to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volt's house.
All these scenes are, of course, a nice and funny story, but there's something very childish about it.
Quite moderate things.
And, like the other movies of Johnny English, I couldn't help thinking, "Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
The laborers deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the working week of the British to four days for five days' wages.
Jeremy Corbin's labor party is about to consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, but pay in five days.
The party is reported to want company leaders to give employees the saving resulting from the revolution in artificial intelligence by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow the staff to enjoy three days off for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea was “incorporated” into the party's economic agenda and would help the population to join the workforce.
The Trade Union Congress had approved a four-day working week to enable workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A high-level source of the labor party said The Sunday Times: It is expected that the policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is our goal, which is in line with the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The labor party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its campaign in 2017.
However, this desire is currently not endorsed by the majority of the labour party.
A member of the labour party said, "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow chancellor John MacDonnel used the labor conference last week to specify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonnel said that he was determined to tear down the power of the “faceless directors” and the “suppliers” of the utilities.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water canal may not get their full share back, as the labour government may make “deducts” on the basis of alleged abuses.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Foundations to transfer 10% of private sector capital to workers who will be able to earn an annual dividend of up to Pound500.
Lyndsey Graham and John JFK say "60 minutes," if the F.B.I. investigation of Cavanaugh can change their mind.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Britta Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the position of Chief Justice for at least a week and raises the question whether the findings of the agency can encourage any of the Republican Senators to support Cavanaugh.
In an interview on Sunday, a 60 Minutes correspondent, Scott Pelley, interviewed the Republican Senators John F.K. and Lyndsey Graham, who were able to find something that would make them change their mind.
JFK seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said JFK.
"When I went to the meeting, I said I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and this information popped up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His answer was decisive, certain and clear."
But Graham's opinion in the vote remained inviolable.
"I've made a firm determination about Britta Cavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments that are equivalent to dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I know for sure is that Britt strongly denied it all," he added, referring to Christina Blacie Ford.
“None of those she called as witnesses were able to confirm these facts either.
It's been 36 years.
And I didn't notice anything new about it."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event in which an exciting starry body, with an equally striking mission, participates: the end of poverty around the world.
For the seventh year of the Festival of World Citizens, as tens of thousands of people are flowing to a large lawn in Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to highlight the real goal of the event: putting an end to extreme poverty by the year 1930.
The World Citizens' Festival, which was opened in 2012, is a follow-up to the global poverty reduction project being carried out by an international group of human rights advocates hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to an event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to volunteer or send an email to the world leader, make a phone call or perform any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the World Citizens' Festival in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people freely to attend a concert really convince fellow citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism," where people believe they're making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen organisers claim that since 2011 more than 19 million "actions" have been registered at the festival by its advocates, who have many different aims.
It is mentioned that, as a result of these actions, world leaders have pledged more than $37 billion, which should affect more than 2.2 billion people by the year 1930.
At the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 promises and advertisements made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds contributed directly to nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most significant responsibilities is The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investment and implementation professionals committed to “helping children realize their full potential” promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help stop undernutrition in the district, which was done after receiving more than 4700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments, and the Global Citizens like you, we can do social injustices to the undernutrition of past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nature Tracy Ulman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the “Food Force” project, which would reach 5 million women and children through activities designed to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival's website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The organisers of the Global Citizen say, "It's going to be a long and difficult journey where we'll trip and fall from time to time.
But, as in the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Jeanelle Monet, are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, with Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman leading the event.
The US can use the Navy for “blocks” to prevent the export of Russian energy:
US Home Minister Ryan Zinke said that Washington could use his navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it works at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy as they are in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he says.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” the Minister says.
Zinke addressed an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that views itself as the "voice of the energy user" in the US.
He then compares Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is the more or less effective use and replacement of fuel,” says the minister, calling Russia a “single trick,” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration had set the goal of increasing the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, which offered a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to get out of the "unappropriate" Northern Flow-2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "nancy" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Northern Flow-2 project, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce resistance to this project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the providers,” said the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Nowak, following a meeting with the US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The US position led to a negative reaction by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry, represented by the German Federation of the German Industry (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the two-way agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes with our energy supply, it creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of the German Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Poetin.
Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, will carefully explore the possibility of running for president in 2020.
A senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, announced on Saturday that he would carefully explore the possibility of running for president after the interim elections.
At a meeting of the City Duma in Holioca, Massachusetts, she confirmed that she would consider participating in the elections.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that's why you need a woman on top," says Warren The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president."
So, the way President Donald Trump was doing during the meeting, he said, "is going to lead this district in the wrong direction."
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
He is an open critic of both Trump and his candidate for the position of Chief Justice Britta Cavanaugh.
On his Twitter Friday, he wrote, "Of course, we need to investigate the F.B.I. before we go to the vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most voters themselves did not think that they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center, fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not run.
By contrast, 32 per cent of the respondents supported her plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supported by former governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in elections and 48 per cent opposed elections.
Other known Democratic names discussed in the 2020 perspective include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden claims to make a formal decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin told me about Trac Palin's post-mortem stress disorder at a meeting with the voters of Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26 years old, joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same thing as other families who have suffered PTSD and have been injured, and our soldiers have returned with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "leave-in-visit" and said of her son and other war-veterans: "They're coming back with other people who're burned, asking if their companions, soldiers, pilots and any other military they've given their country the same respect."
Trak Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with family violence against a woman, having interfered with the situation of violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C., support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and D.C. support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, which bans shelter for victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts submitted an analysis note in Washington on Friday by a court consultant on support for an asylum-seeker challenging policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions claim filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy is not publicized.
The woman claims that her civil husband “and his sons, who are members of a criminal group,” ill-treated her, but on 20 July the U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
State advocates supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, as countries with widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The U.S. new asylum policy overturned a decision taken by the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014 which allowed immigrants who had no documentation to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The D.C. attorney-general Carl Racine stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “needs decades of application of public, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be heard on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban is contrary to this principle,” states the report of the counsellor.
The lawyers also argue that policies against immigrants are damaging the US economy, highlighting that it is this category of citizens that is more likely to become employers and “provide the necessary labour”.
In June, the attorney-general, Jeff Sashnes, ordered the immigration judges no longer to provide shelter to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“The shelter will be provided to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, national or social group or political opinion,” said Sashnes in his statement of 11 June.
This tool was never intended to solve all the problems, even the most serious ones that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palau: the number of deaths doubled in search of survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more difficult.
"It's very difficult now," says a 35-year-old mom named Rhys Kusuma, comforting her sick little boy in the evacuating center of the destroyed city of Palau.
"Emergency is bringing in the wounded every minute.
Clean water is very scarce."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed houses, dig into wet things and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by an earthquake of 7.5 were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Dr. Harris, who had a broken spine and shoulder, were resting near the military hospital in Palau, where patients were treated in the open air because they were forced to leave the premises because of the continued strong push.
He's crying, remembering how a massive earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor he was filming with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I'm stuck in the rubble of the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife shout for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they've escaped and they're all right now."
U.S. ambassador blames China for “attacks” carried out through “propaganda advertisements”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a daily American newspaper highlighting the mutual benefits of US and Chinese trade, the US Chinese ambassador accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to a fee-based supplement by Des Moins Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6th US Congress elections.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US elections is evidence of the fact that US officials have reported to Reuters: a new phase is coming in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to advertise for trade, Beijing and Washington are now in a state of an exacerbation of trade war, as a result of which they equalize their country's import fares.
China's response rate at the beginning of the trade war was to strike exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, were declared by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US's Chinese ambassador and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of farm products to China, claims that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, in an article published in Sunday's Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, writes Branstad, "is now doubling this harassment by placing propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses our deep American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and posting advertisements at Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"However, in the newspaper kiosks here on the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear any dissenting voices and will not see the true variety of views that Chinese might hear about China's worrying economic policy, since the local media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers had “smartly turned away” from the offer to publish the article, although it did not give the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: Cavanaugh's mobs are repulsing women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-level Republicans prefer to stand aside and defend the candidacy of Chief Justice Britta Cavanaugh despite several complaints of sexual violence; analysts warn that there is a negative reaction here, especially from women, which may affect the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding this situation have become extremely acute, and most Republicans have officially declared that they want to continue voting.
You can't go back to such things later, ” writes Grant Rier, professor of political science at Maxwell High School at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that the last minute attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the F.B.I. will be enough to calm the angry voters.
“The women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the Progressive Group MoveOn newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Novam ahead!" in front of the senate, when the Republicans, who control the judicial committee, decided to nominate Cavanaugh, despite Dr. Kristin Blacey Ford's testimony, reported to the Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the bounds," said a non-party politician, Stu Rotenberg, on the news site.
"People say that the situation is already getting bad enough, and it's true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of female voters in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford publicly spoke against a candidate for the position of Chief Justice, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the nomination, this might trigger a reaction.
"It's already a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not only about the vote in the committee or the final vote or whether Cavanaugh is sitting on the bench, but also about how the Republicans deal with it as they do,” says Guy Césil, Director of Prioritys USA, a group that helps to elect the Democratics, the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided about who to believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, and are leaning a little more towards the latter.
A new YouTube poll showed that 41 percent of the respondents believed exactly or most likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Cavanaugh precisely or most likely.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Cavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
At the insistence of Flake, the Fed is currently investigating Ford's charges, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramírez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford, under oath, witnessed before the senate's Legal Committee that Cavanaugh, in a state of intoxication, had attacked her when she was 17.
Ramírez claims that the candidate for the position of Chief Justice showed her her his genetics at a party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lee, it was a joke that the goal of Inupt was to gain "world rule."
"We must do it now," he says about his startup.
"This is a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, files, calendars, music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application is based on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of which can be used in the same browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data repository is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle "personally empowering through data."
According to the director-general of John Bruce's company, the Inrupt idea is that the company has provided resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several state developers contracted to work on the project, and a volunteer programmer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own devolved applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not engaged in talks with Facebook and Google about whether or not his companies should make major changes that would completely change all their business models overnight.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a post on Mediam published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of a new network based on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortia at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee's voice has sounded quite powerfully in the debate about online neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next age of the Internet," says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vanne: Church servant rewarded by the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one warrior clergyman was rewarded with Victoria's cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Rev. Bernard Vann was rewarded with this prize on September 29, 1918 for participating in the attack on Bellenglise and Løkur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military reward.
The monument to this event was solemnly presented by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vanne, said that it was “very symbolic” that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the reward.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vanne held his battalion through St. Canten's Channel "in a very thick fog and under heavy fire of weaponry and machine-guns."
He then rushed into the line of fire and led the group forward with the “greatest courage” and then with one hand threw a military gun, killing three soldiers of the unit.
Lt. Col. Vanne was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vanne, a 72-year-old grandson of a hero, said that "he would hardly have been able to do the same heroicly, but it's all right."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vanne, also laid a wreath at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Young Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Vanne said that "he's a great honour to take part in the parade" and added that "the worthiness of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans hadn't slept all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they showed them Pep's pig.
Imagine you hadn't slept all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you were not allowed to see the main event.
San Jose's table contained 13 battles, including six battles of the main program, which were broadcast all night live on Channel 5 of British TV.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, the British fans were stunned to see Peppa's Pig on screen.
Some fans were not impressed at all because they hadn't slept till morning precisely to watch the fighting.
One of the Twitter fans called this change of broadcast to a children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke."
"The government decree was that at 6 a.m. this content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, Pepp's Pig."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said that they planned to schedule a schedule so that future battles could also be watched by British audiences.
"As for the re-show, I think we can solve this," says Coker.
"But there's Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday, and it's Monday for them.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, there was a lot of text messages, and they were all far from friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, and we thought it was some sort of technical failure.
Turns out, no, it was a matter of public importance.
I promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase that number, but it's overkilled.
Yes, it didn't work well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt inferior because of his sexual orientation
The olympic diver, Tom Daly, says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him the motivation to be successful.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize that "not all are like him" until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first program of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that the winning of the Games was of less concern to him after he had had a baby.
The permanent host of Kirsty Young's multi-year show took a leave of absence for a few months due to illness.
Daily, who was the main guest in Laverne's program, said that he felt "negativer than any of his peers," because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and for girls.
He says, "To date, these feelings of impoverishment and misappropriation have been quite real, but they have given me strength and I have succeeded."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" in order not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexual orientation.
The two-fold bronze olympics journalist became a famous LGBT activist and in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called upon countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he had expressed his opinion because he was lucky to be able to live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
Three times the world champion said that the feelings for the man, the American director Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013 had caught him by surprise.
Last year, Daly married the winner of the trophy, who is 20 years older than he is, but claims that age difference was never a problem.
"If there's so much going on in your life at this young age," he went to his first Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, "it's hard to find a peer who has the same radically opposite experience of life.
The couple became parents in June, and they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daly said that "all his worldview" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about "I need to win a gold coin," says the sportsman.
"But you know what, there are more important things than the gold olympics.
My olympian gold melody is robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer at the age of 40.
Daily said that his father didn't want to accept his death, and one of his recent requests was first-line tickets to the London 2012 competition.
"I couldn't say to him, "Dad, you'll be gone then, and you won't be able to sit there in the front row," says Daily.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he wasn't invincible," says the sportsman.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Games and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life -- diving in front of a crowd of competitors at the Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song, Proud by Heather Small, which helped him prepare for the Games and still liked him so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 in English summer time.
Miquelson, not in uniform, spent this Saturday's Rider Cup on the bench
American Phil Miquelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Rider Cup match, but he'll have to pull up the uniform to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Michaelson, who played a biennal for the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furick to the bench on Saturday for four balls and four.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five-fold big winner shared his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of fixing what was bothering him.
Never with the most direct blow, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old sportsman is not the perfect candidate for the hard track of Le Golf National, where a long raft usually punishes for inaccuracies.
And if the course itself is not quite frightening enough, Miquelson, in the 9th match on Sunday, will meet with the exact champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined with the newest Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If Americans who have lost four points in 12 single games make a big start, the Miquelson match can be decisive.
Ferrick expressed confidence in his partner, although he could say more.
"He fully understood the role he was given to him today, clapped me over the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Feriq.
"He's pretty confident too.
He's a walking Hall of Fame, and he's done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On Sunday, Miquelson will score Nick Foldo for the number of matches in the Rider Cup.
This may mark the end of his career in the Rider Cup, which never matched the height of his personal record.
Miquelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven nobodys, although Feriq said that his presence has been of great use to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to impress people, and he's a great guy who's interested," he explained.
"I think the young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game."
The European team Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows in his experience that significant single-level leadership in the Rider Cup can easily turn into an unwelcome direction.
Dutchine debuted in 1997 in Walderram, where a team led by Northian Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over Americans, but overcame the finish line only a little ahead with the slightest difference, winning 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but just so far," said Bjorn, who was photographed after watching the 2018 class, winning the "Le Golf National" field with a score of 5 to 3 on Friday as well as yesterday, resulting in a score of 10 to 6.
So history will prove to me and the entire team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll be on the full.
Go and do it right.
Nothing is over until the scorecard is set.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I spoke without silently, focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we already know that what we're against is the greatest players in the world."
Bjorn added, "I would never have exceeded myself in this.
We'll have another trial tomorrow.
There's a different thing going on tomorrow, and it's a different thing.
It's always nice to be with your partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you're testing all your skills as a professional golfer.
That's the idea that we need to inculcate in the players, so that we can get to the bottom of it tomorrow.
Now the partner stays behind, and he too must do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Ferrick, believes that individually his players will perform better than with their partners, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Ferik himself had passed this carousel in recent days, becoming part of a winning team in Brooklyn before he finally lost when Europe held "The Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word about it," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the Captain of 1999, joined his players before the last day.
"We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to finish it all quickly, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts great pressure on the middle of the match.
We've properly designed our plan for the game and we've set the kids up as we thought they were right, you know? tomorrow we'll try to do a miracle."
Thomas was asked to try to lead the resistance by meeting with Rory McElroy in the top room with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ayana Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
"I've chosen this kind of group of guys, and in that order, because I think they'll close all possible shortcomings," Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of a new German warship has been rescheduled
The newest frigate of the German Navy was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the cold war, but this will not happen at least next year due to faulty systems and lavinic cost increases, reports the local media.
The launch of the Rainland-Palatinate, the main ship of a completely new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper Die Seet, with a reference to a military representative.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014 but the problems that had emerged since the delivery had complicated the fate of an ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wurttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will have a powerful gun, numerous anti-aircraft and anti-ship rockets, as well as some of the technology of the Steels, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods: it should be possible to install the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant delay in commissioning means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will be obsolete by the time they become armed, notes Die Seet.
The malignant F125 fell into the news headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into operation and returned it to the Blomm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the ship's developer after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “software and hardware faults” that made a military ship useless when used in combat.
The lack of software was particularly critical, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the labour of the old Bremen Frigates.
It also found that the ship was too heavy, reducing its productivity and limiting the ability of the Navy to introduce future innovations.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Besides faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of keeping the latest frigates at anchor are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings of Germany's reduction in maritime power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, had recognized that the Navy was actually ending up with a stock of ships capable of deployment.
The official said that the problem had increased over time because old ships had been decommissioned but had not been provided with ships to replace them.
He visited that none of the Baden-Wurtenberg frigates could ever be armed by the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study carried out in one of the Scottish hills aims to show how bats use the landscape to find food.
It is hoped that the data will provide a new perspective on the behaviour of unique winged mammals and help in further conservation efforts.
A study organized by the National Foundation of Scotland will study common netopys, soprano netopys, and brown long hair bats and Dobanton nights, living in Invewe Gardens, West Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some locations around the site to monitor bats during the entire season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile site surveys using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of shouting as well as the activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A habitat map will then be drawn up and a report prepared to provide a detailed picture of their landscape-wide behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a NTS conservation adviser, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of habitat management, such as grassland formation, and how to maintain forest areas in a state best suited to bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout Britain has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened with extinction due to construction and development work that affects their habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can be dangerous, as well as adhesive fly ribbons, chemical processing of building materials and hunting of home cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They're using sophisticated echo-location techniques to determine exactly the obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for managing more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes the population of bats very seriously.
The organization has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct interviews, field checks and sometimes rescue work.
The organization had even created the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland in the town of Threave in Dumfris and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats lived.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says the property is the perfect place for them.
"Here, in Threave, a great place for bats," he says.
"There are old buildings here, lots of old trees, and all the elements of a good environment.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need to live well."
It draws attention to the importance of testing for bats before performing maintenance within private domains, since the unintentional destruction of one nest may result in the death of up to 400 females and young persons, and perhaps even the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by law, their destruction, harassment or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Footmice Foundation, calls for public help.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many of their species live."
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the charges of rape against him, calling them "feek news," and asserts that people simply "want to propirate" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which has published charges against a football player.
Forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Majorga, who allegedly occurred in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, reported on Friday to the Spiegel.
In an Instagram video where a soccer player had 142 million subscribers, a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information "faith news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've told us today -- that's all the fake news -- the five-time winner of Ballon d'Or claims to be on camera.
"They just want to pry using my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's just part of their work.
I'm a happy man, and I'm doing great," added the sportsman with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are about to sue the Spiegel for the charges they called "inadmissible information about suspicions of privacy," according to Reuters.
The lawyer, Christian Shertz, stated that the player intended to claim compensation for “a moral loss corresponding to the seriousness of the legal breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at the nightclub, he allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed with the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, he fell on her knees and told her that he was "99% good guy, but one percent bad boy."
The papers say that the couple confirmed that they had sex, but that was by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that she was shot at in the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear that she would get revenge" and was afraid of "public humiliation."
A 34-year-old woman said that she was currently trying to change her place of residence because she continued to experience the traumatic feelings caused by the alleged incident.
He was about to join the Real Madrid of the Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved on to the Italian giants of the Juva in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "approves for auto-producers lost forever"
The business and business secretary, Greg Clark, said that the United Kingdom would “repeat it forever” if, after Brexit, it lost its status as a world leader in car production.
He also comments on information that Toyota UK informed BBC that if Britain quits the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the consequences of a delay at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could result in the loss of jobs.
The Bernaston plant produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop," says Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other British car industry has raised concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims to shut down the Mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to auto-producers, if there is no trade in the Brexit supply chain, the risk will be high.
The Toyota production line is launched "at the right time" and the parts for cars manufactured on demand are supplied every 37 minutes by British and EU providers.
If Britain withdraws from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be a breakdown at the border which, according to industry, may result in a delay and shortage of parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store its plant in Derbyshire for more than one day, so production will stop.
Mr. Clarke said that Theresa May's plan, as outlined in Checkers, for future relations with the EU was “created precisely to avoid these border checks.”
"We need a deal. We want to make a better deal that will not only enable us to succeed now, but also take advantage of this opportunity in the future," he said on BBC Radio 4 "Today."
"Not only Toyota, but also other producers argue that we must be absolutely able to continue the successful supply chains."
Toyota could not specify how long the production would stop, but in the longer term warned that extra costs would reduce the plant's competitive performance and eventually reduce jobs.
Peter Tswallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the leader of the factory's union, says that the concern of the organization's members is growing: "In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we won't be able to get them back."
The government representative says, "We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House.
The responsible meeting between Mr. Trump and the deputy prosecutor-general, Rod Rosenstein, may be "rescheduled for another week," as the struggle for the candidacy of Britta Cavanaugh for the position of Chief Justice continues, declared the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein manages the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential obstacles to the President's justice.
Whether Trump would fire the D.A. from his post, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, Washington had for many months led to a lot of speculation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the President by means of the 25th revision.
Rosenstein denied this information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York.
Trump said that he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed in order to avoid a conflict with the senate's trial committee, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blacie Ford, gave evidence.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the F.B.I. complaints against Cavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the senate.
Trump's Spokesman, Sarah Sanders, spoke at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of this meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other events taking place in the Supreme Court."
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists challenge this claim: Sanders has not held any White House briefings since 10 September.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that the absence of the briefing is not due to the “discretion of the community” of television reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they play public.”
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President holds more meetings to answer questions from journalists than any other president before him,” she added, without, however, exact numbers: “We have these numbers.”
Sanders said that the briefings would still take place, but "if the press has the ability to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it's much better than talking to me."
We're trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the past few weeks, and if you can speak directly with the President of the United States, it's a worthy substitute for press-brifing."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conference with dignitaries.
It is rare for a conference to be press-only.
The free, and sometimes strange, behavior of the president before the gathered journalists this week in New York may be the answer to why.
The Minister of Health writes to the EU employees in Scotland about their fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health has asked the EU officials working in the Scottish GHS to express their gratitude to the entire country and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, MSP, wrote this letter to employees less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to defraying the costs of filing status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “In the course of the summer, the talks between the United Kingdom and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued, and the expected decision is due this fall.
However, the British government is also stepping up preparations for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, it is now that I wish to stress once again how much I value the contributions of every staff member, regardless of his or her ethnic background.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that enhance and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Umercrombie has suffered an emergency head injury.
Michael Organe of Tennessee reported that a half-protector of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, had suffered an emergency operation on Saturday after having lost 31–27 in a match with the Vanderbilt Commodores.
The Chief Trainer of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injuries had occurred shortly before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reid said.
The coach and the medical staff gave Umercrombie a sideline of oxygen before putting it on a stretcher and taking it to a medical examination.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that an operation had been made at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are available on the type/step of the injury" and in Tennessee they are trying to find out when the injury occurred.
It was the first season of the Tennessee State, after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign customers will pay a higher stamp fee when they buy real estate in the UK.
In line with Tori's new plans, foreign customers will be charged a higher stamp fee for buying real estate in the UK, and the extra money generated will be used to help homeless people.
This will negate Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
An increased stamp fee will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The treasury expected it to raise up to £120 million a year in favour of the homeless.
The foreign customers will be charged with a higher stamp charge when they buy real estate in the UK, and the extra money that they get will be used to help the homeless, something that Theresa May will announce today.
This will negate Corbin's attempts to attract young voters, who promise to make shelter more accessible and improve citizens' incomes.
An increase in the stamp fee would be charged to non-tax individuals and companies in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus secured should stimulate the Government's efforts to help homeless citizens.
The supplement to existing stamp collections, including an increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary and rental dwellings, may be up to three per cent.
The Treasurer expected this step to yield up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London properties are not bought by British citizens, resulting in higher prices and making it difficult for purchasers to improve their living conditions afterwards.
Many of the country's elite areas, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the large number of foreign customers who, having bought a dwelling here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp collection to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of ripping up property prices by buying land, but not actually using it, and urged Mrs. May to give up the quota for accessible housing in order to correct the “famous situation with regard to construction” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include monitoring rents and halting arbitrary expulsions.
It also wants to give local governments more power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "I said last year that I had dedicated my premiere to the realization of the British dream, that life would become better with every new generation.
This means, among other things, solving problems in our residential market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is not fair that for people who are not British citizens, as well as for foreign companies, the purchase of real estate is as accessible as the hard-working British.
For too many people, the dream of buying their own home has become too distant, and the threat to some people to be outdoors is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland."
The boss of the Sunderland Club, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is to become a Scottish manager at some point.
A 42-year-old Scotser enjoys resuming the North East Club, which is currently ranked third in the first league, separating it from the top three points.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren back to the Scottish Prime League last season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a hat B, and that's it," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland with my father as a child in Hampden, and it always attracted me back.
However, this is only possible if I can become a successful manager of the club."
Ross's predecessors, the Sunderland managers, were also Dicka Avokat, David Moyes, Sam Allardides, Martin O'Neal, Roy Keen, Gus Poyette and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic said that he was not frightened by such authoritative names in such large clubs, having previously declined Barnsley and Ipswich Down.
"For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can get this club back to the premiere.
By its structure and capabilities, this club certainly belongs to the premier league," says the coach.
"It's not easy to get him out there, but I'll think I've done my job only if I can get the club back."
Ross only served as manager for three years, first as assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa rise from level three and in the next season led St Mirren down to win the championship.
Ross claims that he is more comfortable today than ever during his career in Clide, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"Perhaps it was a real crossroads," he remembers his responsible work at Alloa.
"I sincerely believed that management fits me more than a game.
That sounds strange, because I've done everything well, I've earned a good fortune in this job, and I've made some progress.
But playing is harder.
There's a lot of things to do weekly.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good at managing.
I've always wanted to lead, and now, by doing this, I feel most comfortable as a fish in the water for the rest of my adult life."
You can listen to a full interview at SportsOUND on Sunday, September 30, on Scotland's radio from 12:00 to 13:00 in English summer time.
According to the poll, 5:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer.
The heat of the summer has led to an increase in the sale of British pubs, but has lowered sales in restaurant networks.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July and restaurants dropped by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, who received this statistic, says: "Longer solar activity, and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8 percent and restaurants, on the contrary, declined significantly."
The 1.8 per cent decline in income from restaurant trade in June also continued in July.
Pubs and drink bars have shown much better results in restaurants.
Pubs selling only food have also suffered from the heat of the sun, though not as much as restaurants.
It just feels like people want to jump outside just to get a drink.
The sale of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent in a month and the sale of food by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the leisure and hotel industry, says, "These results have continued the tendency that we have seen since late April.
The weather and influence of large social or sporting events remain critical when it comes to sales on the non-profit market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially since a 4.8 per cent annual sales fall will be particularly painful due to continued price pressures.
A long hot summer has turned out to be more than ever impossible for food operators, and it is not yet a fact that August, by bringing more temperate temperature, will provide much needed rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened restaurants, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slower decline in the number of brands.
Monitoring the commercial sales of the Comper Peach Tracker for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses data on the productivity of 47 networks with a cumulative circulation of more than Pound9 billion and is a recognized industry standard.
One out of every five kids has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children — some of them only 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the pages of the "feek-inst"
This news has increased concerns about sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account that parents knew about.
However, one out of every five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake “insta” accounts, i.e. the Instagram, a photograph sharing site.
This news has raised concerns about sexual content publications.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a primary, clean account that their parents had access to, but also secret accounts.
One mother, who had accidentally gained access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, ran into a teenager who had urged others to "rape him."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Managers (HMC) found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social media profiles, half of whom have admitted that one of them is usually secret.
HMC head Mike Bukenen says, "Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not accessible to their parents and teachers, and that's a disturbing fact."
Aileed Doyle will be the "voice of sportsmen" of Scottish light athletics
At the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors, Aileed Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Light Athletics as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most renowned athletic athletic player, and President Ian Beatty says that this is an excellent opportunity for sports managers to benefit from the extensive experience of sportsmen at the international level over the past decade.
“Aylid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global light athletic communities, and we are confident that her participation will be of great value to athletics in Scotland,” says Beatty.
Doyle says, "I want to be the voice of sportsmen, and I hope I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has a total of four gold olympics and now works as a private commentator for BBC, and after a stroke he lost his ability to walk.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will tell me if I'm going to get better, and if so, to what extent.
It was a exhausting job, but I've completely recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing exercise!
Thank you so much for your support!"
The advertisement of the milk sucker, in which nursing mothers were compared to cows, shared the views of Internet users
The milk-sucking company has raised debate on the Internet by publishing advertisements comparing nursing mothers with milk cows.
In a market release, Elvie, the world's first silent breast-sucker, published a commercial music video showing the freedom that the new milk-sucker gives to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in full hay under a music track, where they say, "Yes, I feed my own milk, but you won't see my tail," and "If you haven't noticed it's not squirrel, it's my breast."
And then the chorus is, "Heal, we heal, we feed our babies with breast milk, we heal, we heal."
This commercial, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has caused a debate on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video received a mixed response from the audience, with many saying it sheds light on the “tortures” of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are taken away from them within days of birth," writes one user.
Elvie's milk pump is dressed directly under special bra (Elvie/Mother)
And another comment is, "It's obvious that it's equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk suckers for mothers who keep their children?"
Another user adds: "A advertisement disconnected from reality."
Others, on the contrary, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was "just great."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was feeding the baby, I would have bought one.
Breast feeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a bit crazy, but that's how it feels.
A brilliant product," wrote one user.
And another comment: "The fun advertisement is for moms who breast-feed (often they do it directly at their jobs or in the toilets) and who actually feel a little like cows."
This advertisement is not intended to commend or insult our dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with these invisible milk suckers hidden under their brass.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk sucker is completely inexperienced, has no wires or pipes, is freely placed in a breast-feeding bra, and is invisible, enabling women to move, keep their babies and even go outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood specialist in Mother, comments: "Elvie's milk pump is such a revolution that it deserves a bold and promiscuous advertisement.
By comparing women and milk cows, we wanted to focus on breastfeeding and all its problems, showing in a funny and cheerful way the incredible freedom that the new milk sucker gives us.
This isn't the first time Elvie's milk sucker gets in the headlines.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage of the designer Martha Yakubowski, using this product for its intended purpose.
Hundreds of children moved freely to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained children had increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossinges had remained relatively constant, partly because the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration had made it difficult for children to be placed on bail.
The majority of the sponsors themselves are non-documented immigrants and are afraid to compromise their stay on behalf of a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential trustees and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be handed over to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior member of the Migration and Customs Department, witnessed at the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested bail from minors without care.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been previously convicted.
“Around 80 per cent of persons who are either sponsoring or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are foreign persons who have committed a crime.
So we're going on chasing these people," said Albens.
According to the shelter workers, in an effort to speed up the process of children's registration, officials had introduced new rules under which some of them should be tried within a month of detention rather than 60 days, as before.
In order to declare their legal status to the immigration judge, many are present by video link rather than by person.
Those considered not eligible for assistance would be rapidly deported.
According to shelter workers and the information that has emerged in the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which may lead to violence or escape attempts.
The lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions such as Tornillo, where signs of child difficulty are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare for it or to say good-bye to their friends may worsen the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria commands the US, France and Turkey's "Occupy forces" to withdraw immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mu'alem also called upon Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country had been in war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would be “considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions,” he said to the assembly.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been banished from their homes, the war on terror is almost over.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territory” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 soldiers in a war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Mu'alem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “proliferating irrational fears” that had prompted the refugees to remain outside the country.
“We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he says.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian matter”.
The United States and the European Union caution that Syria will not be assisted in its reconstruction until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. scholars say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major siege of the rebels Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Mu'alem stressed that the agreement had a “determined time frame” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including those from the al-Qa'idah front of Nusra, who would be “destroyed”.
UN Messenger Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee, composed of government and opposition representatives, will soon be convened to elaborate a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in this committee, stating that the work of the commission should be confined to “considering articles of the current constitution” and cautioned against interference.
Why Trump wins a second term
In keeping with this logic, Mr. Trump will win his re-election in 2020 if the impeachment and scandal do not pre-emptively complete his presidency, which is likely to be the hope of many of the liberal audiences.
And this will no doubt be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency in history!"
There's no sign of fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014 the prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million per CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Madow Show" has exceeded cable ratings, gathering 3.5 million viewers at night during the main news show.
"It's a fire that people are drawing to because it's beyond our comprehension," says Neil Beer, director of the ABC "Designed Survivor" drama, about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol has been destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Scowell, a long-public comedy writer and author of "Just funny: a few unpleasant truths about the Hollywood Boys' Infiltration Club" suggests a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi to Boston once before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he's funny!" she said.
In all this chaos, there's something valuable -- it's fun.
Of course, because unlike the rest of the content broadcast on television, Washington storylines can determine the future of Row vs. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrants' families and the health of the world economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged audience can afford.
And yet, when you've been watching a group of experts for six hours in a row talk about Bob Woodward's use of the "deep background" for his book, or about Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket -- clothes warmed with pride, as the Washington Post writes -- or about the sharp description of Stormy Daniels, say, Mr. Trump's anatomy -- it's already outside of the ordinary awareness.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again with the same eyes.
"Personally, his job is to make us feel that the reality show is that he feeds you every night," said Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of the "Pawn Stars" about the changing performance of the Trump show and the daily turns of the story (a N.F.L. fight, commendation by Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleis this week, on the north coast of Kauai there were 27 degrees warmth, the sun was bright, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC during CNN recording.
He couldn't get away from the screen, at least not exactly when they show how Britt Cavanaugh appeared before the senate's Legal Committee and decided the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we were doing all this crazy show, people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," says Mr. Fleis.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money is invested in the fiercest intermediate elections held by the White House
Not surprisingly, the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a cash flow because of the change in districts in the Congress where two officials compete for the same place.
This suburb of Pittsburgh, whose geography has recently been changed, supports a democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district at the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another active official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly intersecting with the new 17th.
The cards were renegotiated after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had ruled in January that, as a result of election frauds, the old districts had been attributed to the Republicans in breach of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a hot debate about funding campaigns between the main party's financial forces, the DCCC and the National Committee of the Republican campaign.
The name Lamb came to be known in Pennsylvania after winning a small difference in the March special elections to the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give democrats a small advantage.
The US punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreated
The academics pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, which had caused a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela; he also owned Panama until his partners evicted the Trump management team.
The Department of State decided to withdraw the United States heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “the recent decisions to deny Taiwan's recognition”, which was announced earlier this month by the spokesperson for the department of Heather Nauert.
However, it was only for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for that country of Central America, with its high rate of unemployment and murder.
Against the background of regular internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held to take stock of a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
However, by mid-September, high-level officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and had effectively stopped considering the issue of El Salvador's punishment.
According to the diplomatic community, the conference is scheduled to take place in mid-October and will be addressed by Vice-President Mike Pence as a sign that the Administration is really attaching importance to this meeting.
The three American diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
Mr. Bolton, the White House representative, refused to comment on the details of the debate that had been reported by three United States officials, including two diplomatic officers, who had agreed to discuss internal matters subject to anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by a foreign analyst who is part of the administration, but who also spoke anonymously.

The next step would be to report to Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Trump's justice, about which there is now very substantial evidence in public reports.
Mr. Mueller is also reported to be beginning to investigate the existence of a collusion between Trump and Russia and its attacks during the past elections.
If the Congress replaces the host, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in this body, just as he prepares to speak again to the voters, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there are many ifs; I don't mean to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it the fall of its equivalents in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to launch a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we have not done so and have missed the opportunity to avoid further years of bloodbath.
The course of history unfolds at such points, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or delays.
The Americans are experiencing some of these critical moments now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the D.A. Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to this newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records of the President's activities and reasoned that he was unsuitable for office.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that The Times data is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recently requested investigation by the F.B.I. into Britta Cavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is finally confirmed as a supreme judge, despite credible charges of sexual harassment and false testimony?
Above all, will we, in the medium term, vote for the Congress that will hold Mr. Trump responsible?
If we do not pass these trials properly, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we'll be able to get through them properly because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jewish woman exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied a Polish house where I lived years later.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about a collision with a soccer club called the "Rapid" in Vienna.
The Rangers accept the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressionable tie in Spain over the Villarreal earlier this month, will enable them to take a strong position in the League of Europe's G-group.
The knee injury prevented the semi-protector of Graham Dorrans from performing for the first time in the season, with a score of 2:2 against the Villarreal, but he believed that Rangers could use the result as a springboard to achieve greater results.
"It was a good time for us because "Villiarreal" is a good team," said a 31-year-old football player.
"We entered the game, believing that we could get something, and we left with somebody else.
Perhaps after all, we were able to handle it, but in general, no one was likely to have a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success was at the second half, where we showed ourselves better.
This Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a hard game, because they've shown good results in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we can make progress and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, given everything that's been going on with my injuries, and the replacements at the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is beautifully chosen, and the kids are really enjoying it; they've been trained for the cheers.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind last season and succeed."
Women are losing sleep because of fear of their retirement.
Although the interviewees had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people involved in the national study said that they had discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
However, only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they don't want to talk to them about this," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of National Life Insurance.
And that's how you start.
Talk to your mate and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not advance your wishes.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and how you will receive medical attention, as this may be an important cost factor.
Consult with your financial consultant; he will help you develop a plan to pay these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own property, provided that you have money.
Sort out your legal documents: save yourself from legal battles.
Make sure you have a health care trust and assign a trusted person who will monitor your health care and make sure that the professionals do what you want if you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that consideration be given to the possibility of creating a financial trust.
A trusted person should be selected to help you make financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your bills if you are incompetent.
Remember the small things: Imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you then be able to provide information on what his medications are and on what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on paper so that you can prepare properly in case.
Martin adds: "It's not only the existence of finance, it's also the choice of doctors."
"What sort of drugs do you take?
Who will take care of your dog?

In Ifracombe, a man fired a pneumatic rifle several times
A man shot a number of times with a pneumatic rifle, returning home from a party.
The victim, whose chest, stomach and arm were hit by bullets, 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove district of Ilfrakombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 in English summer time, as an “accident”.
The victim did not see the attacker.
The wounds are not life-threatening, and the police are currently searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people have died as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the breakdown of communications, rescue workers are unable to get any information from Donggal, a district north of Pale, which is near the epicentre of an earthquake with a force of 7.5.
In Palau more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Donggal on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the Province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow cove on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the earthquake erupted.
Dongala is a county stretching along 300 miles (180 miles) of the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, a district smaller than the Province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi, and in particular of the Donggal coast.
Nickel production is also important for the economy of the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morival, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Authority, in the past 100 years a series of earthquakes have destroyed Palau and Donggal.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed in Donggal.
Tsunamis also occurred in western Donggal in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is on a Pacific flame ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A sequence of violent earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 struck south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with an earthquake of a magnitude of 7.7 occurred in Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 points occurred on one of the Mantawai Islands in Sumatra, causing a 10 meters-long tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the district of Pidi Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake of 2004 and the earthquake.
This time there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.

The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily remained in ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-candidate for President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old Palin from Wasillah, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfered with the situation of domestic violence and for resisting arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State police.
According to the police report, when a friend of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su and will be released on bail at $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “contested innocence”.
Palin faces three class A minor crimes, which means that he may be imprisoned for up to one year and fined 250,000 dollars.
He is also charged with a class B crime punishable by up to one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting an alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of Veterans in 2016 after explaining her son's cruel behaviour with a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are incidental videos on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu, when a tsunami struck shore.
The D.A. wants to hand over a rare death sentence to a suspect in a New York terror attack.
The New York State Public Prosecutor's Office seeks the death penalty for Syfullo Saipov, who is suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York City, resulting in the death of eight people, a rare penalty for a federal crime that has not been committed in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, aged 30, allegedly rented a home Depot truck to attack a bicycle road on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saïves has “intentionally” killed eight people and has “intentionally” caused serious injuries, according to a notice of intent to execute in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges are likely to be subject to the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the grand jury read out a conviction against Saïp with 22 counts of murder, which included eight counts of murder for the purpose of racketeering, commonly used by the federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and the destruction of cars.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “silently planned and premeditated”, the Saïps carried out it as described “in an abhorrent, violent and criminal manner”.
"Sifullo Habibullahevich Saïp injured, damaged and lost the families and friends of Diego Henrique Angelini, Nicholas Cléves, Anne-Lore Decadotte, Darren Drac, Ariel Erlia, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko," states in the notification of intent.
Five of those killed were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the prosecutor in the South District of New York demanded the death penalty for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, the accused, Khalid Burns, was convicted for the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for collusion with the purpose of spying in favour of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed using an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov's judicial documents, an Uzbek national showed no repentance after his attack.
According to the police, he had told the investigators that he was glad that he had done so.
According to the Indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by a video of ISIL on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room, and reported to the police.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of the Indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal public defenders, said that they were “apparently disappointed” by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that a decision to use the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only increase the pain of these events for all those involved,” said Patton.
The defence of Saipov had previously requested the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tori MP says that NYJEL FARAGE should not be held responsible for the Brexit talks.
Today, during a protest at the Tori conference, Mr. Richard Faraj vowed to “mobilize the people's army”.
Former Ukip leader said that politicians should feel the pressure of Euroskeptics, as one of the members of Parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for the talks with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a meeting in Birmingham that the UK would have "greater" if Mr. Farage were the secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Mrs. May in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks was compounded by the fact that members of the Tory party, who were opposed to leaving the EU, joined a separate protest against Brexit, which was taking place in the city.
The premier is struggling to maintain his compromise plan, as expressed in Checkers in the midst of the attacks by Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insist that it continue to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and thus force Europeans and labourers to choose between its package and the Chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihall that he wanted to play Checkers.
He suggested that Mr. Faraj be levelled and held responsible for the talks with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would have gone out,” he said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I will continue to stand for Brexit, but we need to beat Checkers."
In his opposition to the EU, he said, "We have not fought in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay was completely untrue."
Brexit's party's supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, saying to the journalists, "I say Prime Minister, just listen to people."
“Checkers is not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan; he is also not popular among members of our party and our activists, who actually storm the streets and choose us first.
Please put it aside and listen to what you're told."
She added in her sharp address to Mrs. May: "The Prime Ministers remain in their jobs if they remain true to their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that if politicians were to betray the 2016 referendum decision, they should be forced to feel a “fuzzy.”
"It's now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he says.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you get away with it."
Turning to the excited crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit's betrayal, to feel at once.
“We will mobilise the nation's people's army, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit's opponents took a demonstration on Birmingham, and then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved "Tori vs. Brexit" this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, a member of the Laborist Party, criticized the conservators because of security problems in their party's mobile attachment.
"And these people claim to be able to set up Canada's IT systems and technologies, to work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's one complete farce.
Good Brexit doesn't exist in principle," he claims.
Warren plans to explore the possibility of participating in the president's race carefully
U.S. Member of Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, says that after the November elections, she will "suddenly explore the possibility of running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that a democracy from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Deel, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There's talk that she's got a chance of taking over as Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon she held another meeting with the voters in Holioca; since Trump took office it was her 36th meeting with the voters in the town hall.
One of the participants asked her if she intended to run for President.
Warren replied that the time had come for "the women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and for that to happen, there must be a woman upstairs."
As a result of Sims' murder, an LSU player was arrested
Baton-Rose police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of an LSU basketball player, Wade Simms, had been arrested on Friday.
At 11:00 p.m., at a press conference, the Baton-Rose police announced the arrest of Dayton Sampson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department published a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify the person who was able to be filmed.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot at South University on Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head and died on Saturday," reported police chief Murph J. Paul to the press.
Wade stood up for his friend, and he was shot by a simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having participated in the incident, had a gun on him and shot at Wade Simms.
When he was arrested, he refused to resist and was taken into custody at the East Baton County police department.
He grew up in Baton-Rose, he played 32 games with 10 games in the last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
George Hamilton is approaching the title of world champion after command tactics gave him the victory over Sebastian Fettel.
From the moment that Walderry Bottas completed his training on Saturday, he overcame Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the "Mercedes" team tactics would play a major role in the race.
Already with the Pole-Position Bottas had a good start and practically hung on Hamilton when he defended his position at the first two corners, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go to a pit stop, leaving Hamilton to spit in the tail of the entire group, a choice that became decisive.
The Merdez went off to a pit-stop one round later, and then came back behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel struggle, broke out ahead, leaving the Ferrari driver reluctant to leave the internal space free, risking getting caught after a double movement to protect at the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstoppen began from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
Then he ran most of the race, holding on to his own wheels, with the aim of quickly finishing, moving Kimi Riken to fourth place.
As a result, he went to a pit stop in the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight circles, as Rikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a difficult day, because Walderry did a fantastic job this weekend and showed real honour by sharing it with me.
The team did such an extraordinary job to have a couple of tricks in reserve," said Hamilton.
Traitorial sign language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Financial at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for saying that she had not published a letter from Christina Blacie Ford, accusing Britta Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of Chief Justice, of sexual harassment.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention directly the evidence given by Ford to the Senator's Legal Committee, saying that what was happening in the Senate had shown that the participants in those events were “villain, vile, and lying people”.
"The only possible reaction to all this, and what's happening in the last few days in the senate -- that's beautiful, that's anger, anger, abhorrent, and lies," he said.
"You see all these leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Financial did you "leave" information?
Do you remember her answer... did you "leave" the information of the document?--"what, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.
Yeah, stop.
We've been "silent"?...No, we didn't,' he added, with the Senator's intonation.
In July, a letter detailing the charges against Cavanaugh was sent to Feinstein, and in early September it was declared illegal, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, but I didn't leak her information," Feinstein said to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the manner in which she denied the leaking charges seemed to dislike the President, who had comments on it during the Saturday rally, saying, "I'll tell you what, the body language really failed her.
She may not have been "silent," but the body language was the worst I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend his candidate for the position of Chief Justice, whom three women had accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that the Democratics use these charges for their own purposes.
“They are certainly trying to regain their power in all possible ways.
We see vileness, abhorrentness, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're going through to get power and control,” quotes Mediaite.
British elite hockey league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwayne scored two goals, for the Giants in a game against Dundee.
In the Elite League game, Dundee Stars paid for a Friday defeat against the Belfast Giants, winning a return match on Saturday with a score of 5 to 3 in favour of the Dundee.
The Giants gained an early two-gauge advantage thanks to the strikes by Patrick Dwayne and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the level of the home team before Dwayne led the Giants.
Francis Bouchard compared the score to "Dundey" before the two voices of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen confirmed their victory.
For the people of Adam Keef who won the Dundee at 2:1 in Belfast on Friday night, this was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
This was the fourth meeting between the parties in the season, when the Giants won the three previous games.
Dwayne's first goal was at 3:35 p.m. after Kendall McFall's ball pass, supported by David Rutherford, after which Boviller doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the start-up period, Sullivan returned the owners to the game at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Markwardt helped Coney settle the account at 3:16 p.m.
Dwayne verified that the Giants intercepted the initiative during the first break when he scored a second goal at the end of the first period.
The owners regrouped, and Bouchard rebalanced the score, scored a goal at 27:37 p.m.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nilsen give "Dundey" the opportunity to gain leadership for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured the victory by holding the opponents in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, are going to Milton Keynes for the next match, which will take place on Friday.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on board could avoid the earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was given the title of hero postmortem after he deliberately died in order to enable a plane with hundreds of passengers to fly safely.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives as a result of a severe earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, which triggered a tsunami.
Strong suburbs continue to demolish the area, and many of the inhabitants of the city of Palau are trapped under the rubble of buildings.
Despite the fact that his colleagues were fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the horrendously rocking tower of Mutiar airport, Sis Al-Jufry, Palu City.
He remained in his position to make sure that the Batik Air Light 6321 aircraft, which was then on the runway, was able to take off safely.
Then, when he thought the tower was crashing, he jumped off it.
He later died in the hospital.
An Indonesian aeronautical representative, Johannes Sirait, said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, the controller died before the helicopter could land in Palau.
"We are very sorry for this loss," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that thousands of people will be killed as a result of the earthquake, since, according to the disaster management agency, access to the towns of Donggal, Sigi and Butong is restricted.
“The number of casualties is probably rising, as a large number of people are still under the rubble and many have not been able to get out of there,” says a representative of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated the city of Palau, where a mass grave will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Rhysa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says Sky News: "Emergency comes every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets are all over the place."
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, says to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
The tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but it can be much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palau on Sunday and spoke to the armed forces of the country, saying, inter alia, "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the evacuations.
Are you ready?' says CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered from an earthquake in Lomboca that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one person has disappeared after a plane crash in a lagoon.
The flight company that had crashed in the Pacific Lagune in Micronesia now reported that one person had disappeared, while it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew had left the sinking plane safely.
The Air Niugini report says that on Saturday afternoon she has no information about one male passenger.
The company stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and the police to try to find this person.
The company was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and a crew of aircraft after they fell on the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The company also reported that six passengers had been hospitalized on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The reasons for the crash and the exact sequence of events remain uncertain.
The U.S. Air Company and Navy claim that the plane landed in a lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was unable to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes says the plane has begun to get on the runway too low.
"And it's very good," Janes adds.
Janes said that he and other passengers had managed to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane because the water level was about the belt.
He also said that the stewardess were panicking and shouting on board and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that seafarers who repaired the nearby dock also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat on which they were bringing people to shore before the plane was loaded by about 30 meters (100 feet).
Air Security Network data show that over the past two decades, 111 people have died in plane crashes with companies registered with PNG, but none of these crashes have anything to do with Air Niugini.
The intelligence analyst managed to prove that the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution opened a trial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rollett, gave hours' testimony as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the department how he used his cell phone records to summarize the actions of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rollett said that he had received data on the location of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, Tellis spent time with Chambers that night, contrary to his previous testimony, reports The Clary Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information received, his cell phone was close to Chambers; when this became apparent, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his statement, Sanford said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford whether Tellis was telling the truth, arguing that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that "it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
The other difference was that Tellis said he had met the Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, the telephone records showed that they had only been called within one week.
Rollett also showed that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, she had removed her text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," says Hale.
The defence must proceed with its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is "conscious hip-hop?"
Trio hip-hoppers are going to fight negative attitudes towards this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that the hip-hop content has changed from the original political and social problems.
The group wants to go back to its roots and make the "conscious" hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugues and the Common recently witnessed a renaissance in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
The New York nanny sued the married couple for a racist text.
The New York Nanny sued a married couple for discriminating after having received a report from a woman complaining that the nanny had turned out to be another black one, which the woman had erroneously sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
Spouses deny that they are racist, arguing that they are sued for “the purpose of extorting”.
Lyncy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of the two children, expressed her concern that the new nanny offered by the childcare service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family on her first working day in 2016.
"No, it's not, it's not, it's one black one," Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote to her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she sent it twice wrongly to Miss Morris.
In recognition of her mistake, Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, saying in the service that the nanny, who turned out to be African-American, had not done her job properly, and that they expected the Philippines rather than the African-American woman, reports the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work, and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now sues for a married couple and seeks compensation for dismissal of $350 a day in six months, under the terms of an initial verbal agreement, which, however, was not established by any contract.
"I want them to understand that such things are not allowed," she said, "Post" on Friday, adding, "and I know it's discrimination."
The couple disagreed with the charge of racism and argued that the dismissal of Maurice could be considered a reasonable step, since by insulting her they would no longer be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her in a message that she didn't really mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joe Plasco, the Post.
"But would you trust your children with someone you were rude to, even if you were rude without wanting to?
Would you trust your baby?
Come on!'
Calling the suit a "gainfall," Plasco said that his wife had had a baby just two months ago and had found herself in a "very difficult situation."
"And are you prepared to pursue a man who has found himself in this situation?
Not very nice of you," added a banker specializing in investment.
The trial is still under way, but public opinion has already handed down its sentence on social media, accusing the couple of inappropriate behaviour and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the progress with the talking bear, says a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, said this about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of the first reader before it was published.
It's very funny to know that Paddington has a huge success."
She also said that her father, before he had decided to write a children's book about a bear, had worked as an operator for BBC and would have treated the publication with an optimistic rejection, and added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication of his books had been “and joyful and bitter” since their author had died last year.
As for Paddington's bear itself, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family,” and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually became known.
"He was a quiet and humble man," his daughter said.
"Because Paddington was so real to him, and for the father it was almost as if his own child had made progress: he was proud of him, though he did not really consider that success to be his own merit.
I think that's how he treated Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always gave credit to the bear itself."
I had to say good-bye to my dying daughter on the phone.
Following the landing of the plane, her daughter was taken to the hospital in Nice, Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried vainly to save her life.
"Norda called regularly and said that it was really bad that something went wrong," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa.
"Then he called again and said that she would be dead within the next two minutes and that we should say good-bye.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that doctors had given her in order to make her heart work gradually ceased to work while leaving her body.
She died before expected.
I should have just sat there and waited, knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or shout or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself tight."
After all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa, grieving for her daughter's loss, boarded the plane with other passengers, hurried with the enormous loss she had just had to endure.
"No one around knew what had happened," she says.
"My head died, and I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this all-encompassing feeling of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her."
Women survivors prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Aaron Davis and Kelly humphrey postcards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and telephone numbers where people can apply for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he began to get depressed, and at the age of 18, he killed himself.
"I don't want other parents to experience what I experience every day," she says.
A 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Leedney, says her son was a great cook and had a hell of a pretty smile.
"Everyone liked his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiles, the room is like a light.
But before he died, he quit his job because he was going through a really terrible time."
This happened in 2014 and Tyler was found dead by his brother, who was 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, "I never cease to be afraid of a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis invented these cards “to make people know that there's someone to talk to and talk to, even if it's your friend.
You can't sit there and keep quiet, you have to talk to people."
Mrs. Hamfries, who had been friends with Mrs. Davis for years, had lost Mark, her husband, who had lived with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt upset, upset or anything," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas he became particularly ill; he did not even look at the children when they opened their presents."
She says that his death was a huge wound to them, but they have to go through it, and this event has shaken our family.
It ripped it apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Britta Cavanaugh is on the verge of an investigation by the F.B.I.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for -- an investigation of limited time and scope, we could bring at least a little unanimity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would break up against a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican followers want the F.B.I. to investigate?
Time is the reason they hesitate.
The interim elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as expected, it will go badly for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to obtain the person they want and to elect him as the supreme judge of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators to lobby for Mr. Cavanaugh's support, who had since worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, had met his future wife, Ashleigh, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the F.B.I. publishes its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democratics.
It was still not clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh would be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the sitting of the Senate, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of equality of votes and to confirm his candidacy for the office of Chief Justice.
The number of North Korean defectors decreased under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has declined, said the South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byung Seug, referring to the data from the South Ministry, said that compared to 2,706 escapes recorded in 2011, this figure had fallen to 1,127 in the previous year.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates charged by smugglers.
Pyongyang does not offer any public comment.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953 more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most people run through China, with the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China viewed defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forced them to repatriate them.
North-South relations, which are still in a state of war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the stalled nuclear-disarmament talks.
This took place after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they reached common arrangements to demolish the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yoon Ho accused the US of preventing progress on the matter by sanctions.
“If we do not have at least the slightest confidence in the US, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to launch disarmament on a one-sided basis,” said Mr. Ri in his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Britta Cavanaugh "historical," and claims he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nance Pelosi, called Britta Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of Chief Justice, "historical" and said that he was, because of her temper, unable to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at a Texas Tribune Festival event in Austin, Texas.
“I can't help thinking that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave like that, she would immediately be called "the hysterical woman," says Pelosi about her reaction to Cavanaugh's statement to the Senator's Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh was emotionally rejecting Dr. Kristin Blacie Ford's accusation of sexual harassment, which allegedly occurred when they were both teenagers.
Cavanaugh spoke quite emotionally, sometimes even suffocated and suffocated about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee's democrats, calling the charges against him a “grate and well-planned murder of the actor” organized by the liberals, angry at the fact that Hillary had lost the 2016 Presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Cavanaugh had merely confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased against the democrats.
"I think he'll disqualify himself with his claims, as well as the way he attacks the Clintons and the Democratics," she says.
Pelosi was angry when asked if she would try to bring Cavanaugh to justice if his guilt proved and if the democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the F.B.I., he's not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the trial he's at," said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal of D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions concerning the Affordable Medical Services Act or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a representative of the Conservative Court.
At the hearing of his candidacy, Cavanaugh ignored the question whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time to let a hysterical and biased person take up the position of supreme judge and say, 'How wonderful!'," says Pelosi.
And women have to own it.
It's just anger, months and years of fury; she can't go through it without tears.
"When we're angry, we're crying," said Miss Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think it is?"
She went on to say, "I've had a lot of help from a woman who's been working somewhere in the office, and she told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique by which she explained to her companion, "You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really angry."
And then she just kept talking.
I am very impressed with this approach."
Tears are allowed as an exit to anger, partly because they are fundamentally mishandled.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in an office dominated by men: one day I cried out furiously, but I was seized by the chin of an elderly woman, a soulless manager, whom I was always afraid of, and dragged to the staircase.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know that you're crying out of anger.
They think you're upset, and they're happy to think you've finally upset you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, was working with Gary Hart during his Presidential election.
In 1987 Mr. Hart was caught in some casual affair and left the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she could not stand for president.
“This decision was not properly thought out,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called the case Snow White and Seven Dwarves."
The campaign was already nearing its end, and it was very slow in raising funds, so it swore that it would not take part in the race unless it raised $2 million.
It seemed like a completely lost option.
She found that some of her advocates, who gave 1,000 dollars to men, offered her only 250 dollars.
"What am I to them, precious goods or something?" she wondered.
When she spoke, she declared that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions of the people who supported her, by the disappointment of the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access voters, and by the anger of gender-based discrimination that she suffocated.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recounted the press' reaction to her.
"It might have been thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still wondering, what would they write on my monument?
"She cried all the time?"
How a trade war with America can be useful for Beijing
The experts believe that the first bursts of the US-China trade war have been stunning, and, while the battle is far from over, the division between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The largest increase occurred this week, when new prices affected goods worth 200 billion pounds (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has every time struck an even-return, recently imposing $60 billion worth of taxes on American goods at between five and ten percent.
China has promised that the US response will be equal every time, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to experience at least the slightest difficulty soon.
Making Washington retreat means giving up demands, but publicly giving up the US would be too shameful for Xi Jingping, the President of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can properly play cards, the US trade war pressure can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependency of the two economies.
“The fact that a prompt political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to economic corking in any one of these countries is actually far more dangerous than previously recognized by observers,” says Abigil Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, which specializes in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “prepared” for the return of refugees
Syria stated that it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and was seeking assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that had lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mu'alem reported that conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and secure because of the successes in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terror so that people can live there peacefully.
At present, all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country which they have had to leave because of terrorist attacks and the unilateral economic measures which have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for helping to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept any conditionality or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe holds the victory at the Rider Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider Cup, winning the United States team with a total of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US has been losing six consecutive times on European soil, and the European Rider Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe returned the crown to itself thanks to the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Miquelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, struck his first long-distance blow into the water on the 16th hole of steam-3 by taking over his match by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds, becoming 1-4 players who had ever played 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit lost a 5:4 player with the lowest rating in the European team, Turbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
One of the world's best players, Dustin Johnston, gave up 2:1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have been in the Rider Cup for the last time.
The Spanishman, Sergei Garcia, a Veteran of the eight Rider Cups, became the winner of the tournament in Europe's history with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It was a difficult year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," says emotional Garcia after a European victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who had won the American golf legend by Tiger Woods on Sunday with a score of 2:1 in a single game.
"I am extremely proud of this victory -- I grew up watching Tiger Woods play," says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These scores are rather odd for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought throughout the weekend, trying vainly to succeed, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who displayed high-class golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furic of the United States said after his team's discomfort, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we managed to beat Europe a little.
It didn't work.
Take off our hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played perfectly.
We'll regroup, I'll work with America's PGA and our Rider Cup Committee, and we'll move on with our success.
I love all 12 kids, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to lose.
We lost."
Red Tide: The news has reduced the concentration of micro-organisms in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reflects a general decrease in the concentration of red tides in parts of the Bay of Tampa.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier there are reports of extensive blooming, indicating a decrease in the concentration of micro-organisms.
The Red Tide stretches about 130 miles of shoreline from the northern Pinell to the southern districts of Lee.
Eyes can be observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboro County, but the number has fallen significantly since last week.
The red tide is also observed in Pascoe County.
Last week, the average concentration was reported in and around the district of Pinellas, from low to high concentration in the Hillsboro coast, high concentration in Manati and Sarasota and the coast, average concentration in Charlotte County, high concentration on the coast of Lee County, and low concentration in Collier County.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier there is still a risk that the airway will be irritated.
In Northwest Florida, this probability was not reported last week.
