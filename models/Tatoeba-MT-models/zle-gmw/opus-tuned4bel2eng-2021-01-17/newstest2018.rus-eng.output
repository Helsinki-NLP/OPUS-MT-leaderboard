Russian President Vladimir Poetin has signed a law imposing administrative responsibility for the infringement of the time and manner of payment of goods (work, services) in the conduct of public and municipal purchases.
The Act is intended to address the very acute problem of failure of employers to perform their duties in public and municipal purchases.
Two years ago, the situation where employers were unable to obtain payment under already executed State and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the Russian President had instructed the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Russian Federation to take over the problem for special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous employers who had entered into unfinished contracts, tried to avoid their payment and included illegal terms in the contract.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of employers to be paid on public orders, the prosecutor ' s office has submitted  9.7 thousand complaints, resulting in disciplinary proceedings against 4,500 officials and administrative 533 officials, and 75 cases have been submitted to the investigating bodies for the purpose of conducting inquiries, 46 of which have led to criminal proceedings.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles of business debt were paid.
These huge sums have not been accumulated as a result of the failure to pay multi-billion dollars.
Many, systematic delays in the payment of services to employers for much more modest amounts have led to huge debt.
Here's a case.
The manager of a small company won a competition for social transport services for several million roubles.
The man had invested all his working capital, fully complied with his obligation, but had not received the money on time.
The result is an increasing financial coma of wages, taxes, credit that would have led to a bankrupt business if the businessman hadn't requested help from the prosecutor's office.
The problem has now been maximized in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of the year of 2017, the total amount of debt on State and municipal contracts, as determined by the prosecutors of the entities of the Russian Federation, was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor's office is operating under the manual crisis management regime.
The Attorney-General personally holds retreats with the local authorities, at which all prosecutorial failures and measures to address them immediately are examined.
Such operational meetings have already taken place this year in Jaroslavla and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ on the introduction of changes to the Code of administrative offences in order to establish the administrative responsibility of the employer's officials for breaching the time and manner of payment of goods (work, services) in the conduct of public and municipal purchases, signed last week by the President of the Russian Federation.
The draft law was drawn up by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences with an article which provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for breaching the employer's time and manner of payment of goods, jobs and services in public and municipal purchases.
If an official had already been administratively punished for a similar offence, he would be disqualified for a period of between one and two years.
All prosecutors of entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure that these legal innovations are applied in practice.
Civil Rights Unit has issued a travel warning to Missouri.
The National Association for the Progress of Colored People has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri because of State-based discrimination and racist attacks.
The group's statement is as follows: “Prevention for travellers of the National Association for the Progress of Colored People, valid until 28 August 2017, encourages African American travellers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly attentive and careful in travelling around the state in connection with a number of suspicious racist incidents that have recently occurred all over the state and which have been brought here.
According to the National Association for the Progress of Colored People, the recent Missouri law had prompted the group to announce a movement warning, making it more difficult for people to win discrimination claims, and for State law enforcement agencies to target minorities disproportionately.
"You have people subject to human rights abuses.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin colour, beaten and killed,” said the newspaper Kansas City Star, Rod Chapel, President of the National Association for the Progress of the Colored People of Missouri.
"We hear complaints often as never before."
This is the first warning of this kind declared by an organization to the state of the United States.
The Group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students based on race at Missouri University and the death of twenty-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had run out of fuel on a state trip, and the Missouri State police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report from the Missouri State Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which 75 per cent more likely to be stopped on the road for black drivers than for white drivers.
"The purpose of the warning is to keep people informed of the situation and to alert their relatives and friends and colleagues to what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be trained in one way or another whether they will take the bail money with them or tell their relatives that they are travelling around the state."
According to the latest data from the F.B.I. hate crimes report, there were 100 hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, making the state the 16th State in terms of the number of such crimes.
A movement warning is also a response to the new Missouri State Act, which will make it more difficult to prosecute a legal person for discrimination in the workplace or in the workplace.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued warnings to travellers in Texas and Arizona after these states had enacted new immigration control laws, under which local law enforcement agencies were ordered to arrest people for breaking immigration laws, which ACLU believed should have increased the number of checks based on race.
Moving warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Two people died as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown people fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reporting to the Reuters, referring to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the exchange of fire, two people, including one policeman, died and three were injured.
All wounded have been taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on the security guards.
One of the intruders was arrested and the other managed to escape.
Rostourism supports the law abolishing free baggage for non-returnable airfares
The head of Rosturgy, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview with the RBC television channel that it was “positive” to adopt a law abolishing the free movement of luggage on unrecoverable airfares.
"There is a need to create conditions under which a person without luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one with baggage," he stressed (the TAS quote).
Mr. Saphonov said, however, that, despite citizens' fears, it would not be necessary to pay for the carriage of clothes and a mobile phone in a hand-clothes.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and announce it, say it's for top clothes, for umbrellas, for mobile phones, for iPads or even for some computer," said the head of Rostourism.
Formerly, Russian President Vladimir Poetin had signed a law providing for the right of air companies to rule out the free carriage of baggage on a non-returnable flight.
This means that air companies can themselves determine the number and weight of baggage included in the non-return rate.
Vladimir Poetin has asked to remove the pollution of the Bikala
Russian President Vladimir Poetin reported at a meeting on the protection of the Bikala that over the past few years considerable areas of the lake had been severely polluted.
It requested that sources of funding, plans and implementers be identified to address the pollution.
Mr. Poetin has also ordered a full reclamation of the polluted areas.
"There is a need to deal with the objects that continue to work here, most of them have worn out," quotes the President's RlA News.
He added that the Russian General Prosecutor's Office should conduct a check to detect ecologically dangerous activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area due to the emergence of natural dumps and a number of environmental disturbances by the resters.
"I want to stress this: not everyone has to check; here too, the measure needs to be known, but it is illegal and ecologically dangerous activities and to take appropriate action," he stressed.
The Office of the Public Prosecutor had previously reported a decrease in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had suggested an increase in the number of sites subject to environmental surveillance.
On 15 June, Vladimir Poetin, in a direct line, stated that there was a need to change the law to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural areas of a special protection regime.
He was informed by the inhabitants of the island of Olhon, which belongs to the Natural Territory of Bikhal.
The Head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donski, immediately suggested that the problem be resolved by specifying the limits of the Bikala water protection zone, but in the Buratiy government it was recalled that such a change was not enough, since the restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Earlier in the Ministry of Economics, it was suggested that the problem be resolved by modifying the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A new temple will appear in South
In the village of Sosová, members of the community from the small indigenous peoples of the North, the Rahtina, together with the inhabitants of the Berezov district, are participating in the construction of the Orthodox Temple in honour of the saint Nikolai the Miracle.
Its location is the shore of the river, the Temple will be well seen from afar, so it will serve as a beacon for fishermen.
According to the community, construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now installed and church bells are available.
The Igrem Navy's REB provided a transport escort.
The Temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderful, since it is regarded by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
Fishing, on the other hand, gives the settlers jobs and feeds them.
The locals are waiting for the Temple to open their doors, and the children even write about it in school writings as local sights.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do Singapore follow laws?
I'm talking to local businessman Chang sitting in a diner in the open air.
When Chang comments on the situation in Singapore, he smokes one cigarette after the other, and carefully puts cigarettes into an iron box he borrowed from his office.
After this conversation, a businessman goes to the nearest urn -- 100 meters to it -- and throws bulls there.
A fine for garbage in a public place of $500 local, reports Chang.
You know, I've had a reflex since I was a kid, and you can't throw a candy fan on the bridge, you'll be fined right away.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed, Singapore's pavements in the middle of town are clean, like a museum.
Chang says three months ago, an 18-year-old son of his neighbour painted a graffiti wall of an old colony building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to whipping.
What?!
Imagine.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of physical punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standards of living and the most severe laws, it was addressed locally by the AIF columnist.
Nobody here is thinking of abolishing the death penalty," explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long given up both the European Union and the US on this matter.
If a person transports or trades a large quantity of drugs, he will have a hanging.
In 2002 a 22-year-old Australian citizen was arrested at Changi airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
It was defended by the Australian premiere, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even the Pope.
However, the guy was eventually hung.
After that, the drug couriers of our country are carefully moving around.
The point is, Singapore requires that laws be observed by everyone in a row, not just by the modest and the poor.
It doesn't matter if you're a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
One option is, if you get a pound of cocaine, you'll be hung.
When you walk around Singapore and you meet a bunch of warning signs all over the place, it's amazing how many bans there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies and can be bought strictly by a doctor.
No gum will be taken from a tourist when he arrives, but if you put a rubber in the subway, you'll be fined $1,000.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on their neck, "I was trashing."
For leaving the urea of cigarettes in addition to fines, they are often sentenced to "shooting to the jaws": cleaning parks and beaches for a week.
6,000 roubles is paid by an “offender” who forgets to wash his water in a public toilet, and when an effort is made to fix a slight need in the elevator of a house, a special detector works, locks the doors and sends a signal to the police.
Exotic laws include bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public singing of songs, and even excessive flooding of room plant(s): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they are fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
Anyway, the idea is, no matter how hard you try, you're going to break something.
It's not like that, but it's trying to expose me to Muhammad Cubir-Kajaria, the owner of a local travel agency.
Special fantastic laws exist only on paper, and over the past 20 years I haven't seen anyone be attracted to for breaking them.
Why do they stay?
So citizens don't relax.
The implementation of the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let's say, if you sell a cigarette to a teenager, you'll get a chain of punishment: the owner of the store will pay a huge sum, the intruder himself will be hit with sticks on the back, and the salesman will also be beaten and jailed.
It is because of such severe law that crimes are very rare in Singapore.
Is this justified?
As early as the 1970s, we had a chaotic situation on the roads -- motorists ignored the traffic lights, drove as they wanted, got drunk driving.
After a year's fine, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having had a drink of whisky, knows that if they stop, the policeman will not let go for bribes, pay a fine for the price of the apartment, and be sent to jail for years.
For many aliens, the city-state in South-East Asia seems to be a form of concentration camp.
In 1993 the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Death Island," a visitor from the United States of America that terrorized the general wealth of the inhabitants, "a frighteningly clean airport" and "cultural nature".
Descendants, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and they shouldn't be.
The first days in Singapore, and you're really scared to throw your paper on the pavement, you get caught in the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the Little India neighborhood, and all of a sudden, a pattern breakup, and the bus stops with plastic cups.
"What do you mean?" you wonder.
And like that, the Singaporeans smile.
Things happen.
Not every crime like that gets caught on the spot, but you need to know, if you get found, you won't get cleaned up, because you broke the law.
Most often it's enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
At the Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh, I moved very cautiously; motorcyclists often extract smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
There's a lot of dirty homeless people and beggars in the middle of Paris.
Not everyone in our streets is trying to throw trash into the trash.
Singapore, however, thanks to a series of draconian fines and ruthless (until the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on earth.
You'll think about it.
That's the human nature: remember, and in Russia no one was attached to driving until they started fines.
Although Singapore is not about fines, it is about voluntarily enforcing laws.
And you have to think that we in Russia too would enjoy the clean streets, the absence of garbage in the subway and the arrest of those who mix the elevator with the public toilet.
Here's the physical punishment. Thank you. Don't.
Singapore's laws, however, are at least worth looking at.
Nothing holy?
Now the White House of Trump has targeted the Statue of Freedom.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when it starts to fight the statues.
The Americans understand this as well as everyone else -- hence the deliberate theatrical demolishing of the statue of Saddam Hussain at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump's key ideologists, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought the symbolic axe over the Statue of Freedom during a violent dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the President's proposals to sharply reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't attempt the statue itself.
The regiments of pleasure boats and artists representing the Statue of Freedom would lynch it if he tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially of what was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller groaned at Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you're talking about was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller put the facts right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
It's about the current resounding words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state does not invite any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming of breathing freely / the miserable waste of your vast shores."
Never before have "unlucky trash" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature -- he made it clear that in America Trump didn't expect these people.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus -- and her friends who struggled to put her words in the middle of the statues after her death -- were very well aware that they were doing a completely political act.
It was intended to indicate the link between the French and the American republics by means of a banal classic figure, a woman's image of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, a woman's figure is no longer abstract; she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of poems and images was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right ones did change it back.
Public Rush Limbo, a sort of John the Baptizer who announced the arrival of Trump in 2010, argued that freedom did not invite anyone, rather she was an early neoconservative carrying the flames of America lying in the darkness of the world: "Freedom goes on.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch isn't needed to light the way to the US."
Against the use of Limbo here, it really hit the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus' great creative achievement was to see her as she would be seen by exhausted, unhappy but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a better life.
Its statue answers them with the words of hope and hospitality they dream of hearing.
And, of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.
Their torch is not needed to light the path, but to stir up hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Cup of 2017: Neil Blake highly values the Scottish members of the UK.
Aileed Doyle remembers a time when there were only two Scots in the UK.
Neil Blake, director of the United Kingdom Light Athletics Federation, said that a 16-member Scottish team at the World Cup would make a "significant contribution to the team's game."
A record number of Scottish lightweights was selected for the London Cup of 2016, which began on Friday.
Blake believes that Scotland's "born something special" and the United Kingdom's Light Athletics Federation should take that into account.
"We know it and we're trying to understand it and we're going to keep it as long as they have potential," said Blake.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they think it has to do with what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics thinks that what they've done has to work.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: with what they've done, we have to work.
And people on the street think the same thing.
I don't know why this is happening, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some of the Scottish lightweights claim to be medailles, including Laura Muir and Andrew Buchert, who will compete with Sir Moe Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres; and Aileed Doyle has chosen the team to be his captain.
"Aileed is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," says Blake.
"Many light-flyers, whether Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, left this room, feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and the honest feelings that Aylid had put into it were wonderful."
The winner of the silver coin of the Commonwealth championship, who at her fifth World Cup would run 400 meters away with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British team is "unimaginable."
The previous record for the world championship was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, who specializes in the middle-range race, scored five British and two European records last year.
She'll run 1500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who's going to be playing the 1500 meters race, is another Scot who needs attention: behind his back, he's had a successful season in which he won the British championships and the Annual Games.
Doyle remembers his first world championship, when Lee McConnell was the only Scotch in the team.
The team captain says she's "incredibly proud" that so many of her countrymen not only joined the team, but in some cases they'll claim a coin and fight to get into the finals.
"The captain of the team chooses the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that your comrades voted for you and chose you--it's quite a special thing to me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
This shows how much we've achieved.
And they're all successful light-flyers who'll try to get on a pedestal of honour.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I just noticed that we're very lucky to have the World Cup at home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we're going to be at the stadium again.
I've got another chance to go to his place and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere there will be great."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't run for public office unless you're ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't prevent them from criticizing him for anything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism certainly irritated him.
But he didn't shut his critics up.
Because as early as 1783 Washington said, "It's possible to take away the freedom of speech and we deaf and dumb will be led as sheep to the slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who gave their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Rights Union sued him for it.
The governor's employees called the suit trivial, and the Internet comment was written in the "so and what" style.
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people would say.
But it's important too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
He's ranked second among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He showed a firm hand in managing the state and his principles.
He also uses Facebook as a primary means of communicating with his voters and shows his bald head with jokes on his page after chemo.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's page -- which is declared to be a public official forum and run by government officials for tax money -- is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, the Spokesman, Emilia Ches, defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments was just a modification.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers, and haters who are angry on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are the real people, not the trolls, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who turn to their chosen leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan to be a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Ramana, from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed at his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the section of the comment to an article in the Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, some people immediately say it's a so-called trick instead of admitting they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's officers call "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "active living position."
In the Facebook era, it is easy to manipulate your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before, when it was necessary to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical frontlines, or arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, only in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not listening to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banished on his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this subject was made this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge of Alexander James C. Kesheris, the President of the Watching Board of the County of Laudon broke the First Correction by beating the elector in her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, the Republican governor Matt Bevin filed a claim against the American Civil Liberties Union for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's era of accessible postal spending, it was about the same as the Internet today.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers had quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters had seriously compromised its credibility.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the aliases of Juricola, Valerius, Belizarius and Porcius wrote letters to newspapers that ridiculed Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington's online project, his office was overwhelmed by petitions criticizing his position under the Treaty of Amity, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very heart of our State.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to be comfortable at the Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lotian hosts the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older sportsmen.
A native of Northern Ireland, who was a neighbouring leader at the Archerfield Links Club, and was moving towards the final round last year, until he lost to Paul Ilse, was attached to the new site and served as a member of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Club, Gerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club build, and we've seen it succeed with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this field at its best moment, it is in a wonderful state.
Gerry did a great job setting up this place.
He's a strong supporter of this game and proud of his achievements here.
It's a great demonstration for this field."
The Englishman Ilse looks forward to being able to defend the championship for the first time, despite the fact that he won both the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career and the European Challenge Tour.
"It's a really special feeling," said a Southport player.
"I couldn't try to win "Extremadura Open" again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
It's magic to go back to this corner of the world.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
Last year's memories came back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it."
Returns to the battle in Gary Orr's native country, who joined the European tournament for older sportsmen after he turned 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2012 "Aberden Asset Management Scotty Open" tournament.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said the resident of Helensborough Orr.
"You want to speak well, but you feel it's an extra burden."
I played with great pleasure again, and I showed a pretty good golf.
I'm satisfied with the way things work out so far."
This trio will be joined by the former winner of the Masters tournament, Ian Woosham, and the senior champions, Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James, and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Captain of the Reder Cup, Sam Torrance, two of the six Scots in the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair, and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free, and the parking lot is 5 pounds an hour if there's one person in the car and 10 pounds if there's two or more people in the car.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb negative emissions
The kind of tunnel above the highways, which can absorb carbon monoxide emitted by cars, is already being tested on British roads.
The country's transport agency, according to Autocar, reported positive results of testing a 100-metre tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north.
A six-metre-high tunnel is built with some recent polymeric material that can absorb the dangerous substances contained in the car exhaust.
However, creating an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the massive measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric cars, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, increase the use of commercial electric transport and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
Official statistics show that a quarter of all air pollution is related to transport, while poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the penalty for disabled Mammaev to a fine
Mosgorsud changed the sentence to a fine of 200,000 roubles for a disabled man named Anton Mamatev, who had been sentenced to four and a half years in a colony.
The TASS reports this.
The prosecutor's office had previously requested the court to change the sentence to a conditional one, explaining its request to the effect that the mother's condition “is preventing him from being in prison”.
The 28-year-old Anton Mamiev was sentenced to four and a half years' imprisonment in a general-regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former Special Forces combatant.
On 19 July, the court released the man from detention at a visiting hearing in SIZO.
poverty and death in Indonesian gold land
Bardin Degey doesn't use a stove to prepare dinner.
She doesn't even use pots very often.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniay County, in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just puts the sweet potatoes here called the "note," directly into the hearth.
After half an hour, the coated tuber gets out and eats with impatient, unwashed hands.
The Degees are sitting on the ground floor -- she doesn't have any furniture -- and that's where she does her homework, like washing her clothes with vague water from a nearby moor.
The bathroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
Life is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many of the men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk around the village after five o'clock," she says.
It is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was joined by Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote, raising their hands in public to the occupying forces.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands had quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintained strict control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the Province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarothali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; it includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapur, the administrative center of the province, to Nabier, and then a five-hour shake on a hired car.
There's no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in various red shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners, have come here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the pope had worshipped a god called Ugo Tameo.
There have been other changes.
"It was unusual for us to wear these clothes," says Deguei, pointing to his bright, hand-cold turban, dark skirt, and bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, 28 percent of its population lives below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The largest and most lucrative gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Pania, a high-rise province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015, Freeport recovered about $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast forest reserves valued at $78 billion.
This wealth, however, results in one misfortune for the Popes, guaranteeing that the strong Indonesian armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation into The New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly 20 million dollars to local troops and units, including up to 150,000 dollars to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the popes threaten the existence of this gold mine and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 popuas have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in the native highlands of Papua in the 1970s could be considered as genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Diocese contains evidence of the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture – especially, as stated in another report, rape and electrocution – and violent suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to calculate the number of casualties because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harrison, researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
Guillaumes have been protracted, as Papua's resources have attracted an inflow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The country's 3.5 million inhabitants are 83 percent Christian, but their demographics change as Muslims come from densely settled Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Yavan shops, the "warungi" sell fried chicken and a blend of gado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to resist competition.
“Migrants have begun selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets cheaper than natives of Papua,” explains Abeth Yo, a 25-year-old Poniai, who moved to Jayapur, the capital of the Province, for work.
"That's why the natives of Papua, mother-mother (female) of Papua, lost their market."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, known as the Jokowi people, vowed to address inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 Presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter secured support from 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including the Paniai.
But there's hardly any change in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to meet our hopes for justice," says Yow.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokoki Paniai experienced a tragedy.
On December 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas songs at a fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a bike broke out of the darkness.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and soon returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and witnesses, soldiers who were drunk were chasing children and beating them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, Julianus Emo 16 years old, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to a government building near the election commission, and the next day the situation got worse.
About a thousand pope men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed the White, the pope's pago dance, running round and playing bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation broke out, soldiers on internal radio were ordered: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," it sounded as it was in an official document that was seen by the TV magazine's correspondents, but which was not published in the local media.
The 50 - year - old Jeremias Cajame, head of the Kogo Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calmness, asking the crowd to move away from their homes.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, a bullet suddenly struck my left wrist," he told the magazine "TIME," standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kaime still doesn't know who shot him, but he says the bullet came from the shreening of the soldiers gathered.
"There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots," he added.
A local resident of Alfius Jowa was shot three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, said.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Johns, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Jotge Mende, Chief Inspector of the Papua police, told reporters that his officers were merely "protecting" their base because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the police officer of Papua Pujo Sulistio in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more wounded.
The news of the murders only got to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapur, expressing his sympathy to the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately, that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Viranto, said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights abuses.
But almost immediately the excuses came.
“Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some occurred in the 1990s or at the beginning of zero.
The fact is, we certainly want to address these abuses, but there are procedures that need to be followed," he said.
Then Viranto declined to speak to the magazine TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said that he had no plans to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be decided through the courts."
Viranto, whom the United Nations had accused of “offences against humanity” in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the 1999 bloody East Timor independence vote, said that 11 human rights abuses in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims from Pania had encountered such statements with grave distrust.
“In the past three years I have been asked four times, but there has been no change at all,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he's still living in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the view that the inhabitants of Pania were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"The soldiers came after me after we buried the bodies," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the nearby Pania district of Deiya.
During a conflict between the villagers and the construction manager, who refused to help bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were wounded, including children.
A 25-year-old man, Ravianos Dove, who drowned while catching fish in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's construction site office.
According to the police, villagers threw stones at officers who responded with warning shots.
But locals claim that a mobile team (Indonesian SWAT) began shooting at the crowd and killed one man.
"We've been in such a panic, we're afraid of revenge," reported the twenty-year-old Domingue of Badia, who lives near the hospital and has seen the quick delivery of the wounded.
"I've been in my house for two days."
The Parliament of Dayia demanded that officers involved in the incident be called to account and that the mobile police team be withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development has caused discontent among the Mea, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes spread across the green central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the "Movement for a Free Papua" (OPM), an insurgency army that claims to defend the rights of the Pope by launching sporadic attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Pania, including Thadius Yogi and Daniel Judus Komia.
As a response, in recent years thousands of people have been arrested in Pania and detained unjustly by the military under the pretext of “protecting national independence”.
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniai, it is considered “a sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases discontent.
A small piece of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the local population.
The bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat, mostly a note, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold locally.
Ten tubers worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, there has been an increase in the economic inequality between indigenous Papuans and new immigrants, who have arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabir airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually held by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Popes rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribe council.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of the international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basil Lonshan had been removed from Papua for “insufficient alignment with the organizations concerned” despite having received rare permissions to film.
According to Felim Keene, Vice-Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jokovi campaign to lift media restrictions in order to contribute to transparency and development have not been met.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from rebel Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mostly confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands – requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diverse and widespread abuses” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have in the past supported OPM.
The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arramanat Nassir, rejected the group's statement, telling journalists in Jakarta that "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights abuses."
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Netherlands human rights ambassador, Kiis Van Bahar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, the local population broke down their silence by praying, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but the Popes say they're unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Joki is a man with good intentions, but he's surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, chairman of the tribe council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, apart from living in the shadow of a threat from the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in a miserable state.
Gobay says that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the rest of the populace, consider their voice for Jokowi to be the debt that he should pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and harassment, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience, burying the body of one of the victims on the ground just opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never be done, they will at least prevent the guilty from forgetting their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Jacobus without raising his head.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
Fire for the second time covers the Tube skyscraper "Fackel"
The fire engulfed one of the world's highest skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of people to leave the seventy-nine-story structure 337 meters high.
It's the second fire in a high-rise building -- which is by coincidence called the "Fackel" -- in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and people shouting.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters to a skyscraper called George.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, fire brigades extinguished the fire at about 4 a.m. local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide shelter to victims.
The event can bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in high-rise exterrestrials around the world.
In the course of the investigation by the Fackel administration after the fire there in 2015, it was found that the most affected was the crying, the external panels used to decorate and insulate.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the crying panels of the Grenfel Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the June fire that had caused the death of some 80 people.
The increase in the tourist flow to Ida Viruma in June was minimal
As can be seen from the data received by the RUS.err.ee porter from the Statistics Department, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists took advantage of hotel services in June 2017, representing an increase of 125 or 0.6 per cent over the same period a year earlier.
Meanwhile, the number of local tourists has decreased and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
In June, for example, the foreign tourist flow increased by 7.3% (544) to 7,994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12.944 to 12.525.
The region has seen the largest increase in the number of Russian tourists, by 8.9 per cent or 318 since June 2016.
A total of 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at the Ida-Viruma Hotels in June 2017.
Andrey Malakhov made known to his fans who were responsible for his departure
Andrey Malakhov hinted to his fans at Instagram who was responsible for leaving Channel One.
So far, he had no comment on the rumours, but today he posted a piece of an article in the August 1st newspaper.
Photo Malakhov signed a "boss milk sucker" tag.
Article on how to prevent an employee from burning out and to pay attention to the employee's condition.
When you recall the numerous reports that the host was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived Producer, who was trying to reformat "Let's Talk," it becomes clear what he had insinuated so transparently, writes "CP".
It was reported that Andrew Malakhov, a television director, was currently on vacation and had not signed an application to be dismissed from Channel 1.
The dismissal situation may be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five military soldiers died in a car explosion
At least five soldiers died in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, reporting to RIA News.
According to the police, a mined car exploded the night before the military roadblock in Girishk County.
We've heard of 20 dead.
A new emergency occurred in Giriska on Friday morning.
The armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the assailants and the security forces continues.
Daver shot a video of a shark that bit his camera.
The daver and researcher Greg Scomal captured a video shark that bit his GoPro action camera.
Rollick posted a branch of the United States Marine Fishery Authority in Massachusetts, an employee of which Scomal is a member, on Facebook.
The incident took place on 2 August off the coast of the Cape Code peninsula in the north-east of the United States, describing the Necn Portal.
The man tried to take the shark off the camera he was holding on a special stick during the submarine voyage.
After observing the man, an animal more than three meters long floated up to him.
The shark began to bite the camera without attempting to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the hunter did the same to determine whether the gadget was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also observed that such a sea animal behaviour had turned out to be a new one for scientists.
The cause of the massive fight in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military Region came to the Yelan training centre, where a mass fight took place to investigate the incident.
Some details of this assault have already become known.
According to Mash, which appeared on the Vkontact page, contractaries of U.S. military unit number 31612 fought violently because of an unfilled bed.
The beginning was that a private named Saiyan demonstrated that he had ignored the officer's order to refill the sheet.
The officers were joined by soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
Within half an hour, 140 young men were smashed into beds and shells in the barn, and glass was smashed.
More than ten people were injured in a mass fight.
The CED denied information about scissors.
The study found that at least one fifth of the passengers in the United States carried prohibited objects into a plane.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited objects into their luggage on board the aircraft through the United States Transport Security Authority's inspection points, including at least 6 per cent on board, without being seen with illegal knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later found that they had accidentally possessed firearms, ammunition or explosive substances.
A study carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covering over 1,000 people also showed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of those who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something that the ATB prohibited, 19.7 percent were millennia compared to less than 15 percent of the X generation.
The most deliberately passing the ATB is food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had deliberately carried sharp objects through the search, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men responded that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the plane.
The company stated that it had been studying passengers across the country to find out how many of them had accidentally been smuggled through airport searches and how many had deliberately done so.
It is quite expected that most often, knowingly or unconsciously, smuggles through searches by those who fly most.
According to the company, the ATB rules are rather complex and complicated.
People often don't know exactly what kind of fluid they can transport and how much they can transport.
So it's not surprising that most of what the ATB takes are illegal fluids.
Some time ago, people thought the ATB might consider it illegal to transport a book.
The fluids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Prewitt refuses to defer the implementation of the Obama emission reduction rules
The day after the 15-state claim, the head of the Environment Protection Authority cancelled his decision to defer the implementation of the Obama rules to reduce emissions of air-polluting and generation-producing substances.
Prüette explained his decision by saying that his agency now listens more to the needs of state environmental administrators than to previous administrations.
He did not mention the claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute took place around the date of 1 October, by which States should meet the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Prüitt announced that he would defer their implementation for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid "incompatibility with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Prewitt, who was the state prosecutor-general of Oklahoma before President Trump was appointed to his current position, was long known as a consistent adversary to the tightening of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, D.C., Puritt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of rules that were opposed by the chemical or gas oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is yet another legal failure of the course that Peter took to return to his old standards.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his power by attempting to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the loss of methane.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Prüitt suggested that, by radically changing the course for the standards for ozone, he simply complied with the obligation of the EPA to work with the states in the integrated process of the timely implementation of the new standards.
"In previous EPA administrations, it was often impossible to meet the target date, then waited for claims from activists' groups and others and discussed the time frame during the settlement of the case," said Prüette, who had filed more than a dozen claims against EPA in his previous position.
"We don't believe in justice through trials, and we take the time limits seriously.
We also take seriously our statutes and the power that it gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that Prewitt may at some point again use his "deferral powers and other powers given by the law" to make sure that the "jcyjdfys" rules are clear and available.
Republicans in the Congress are insisting on a broader revision of the rules on ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, aims to defer at least eight years of implementation of the 2015 rules.
The Senate has not yet voted on this matter.
The New York attorney-general, Eric Schneiderman, who was the head of the state association that filed the EPA suit this week, said that the group intended to continue the legal pressure.
"The evolution of the EPA course -- after our claims -- is an important victory in the struggle for health and security for 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who have been directly affected by their cities," said Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C.
The ground-level ocean occurs when normal pollution from machines, power plants, oil processing and chemical plants and other sources reacts in the atmosphere with sunlight.
This can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of early deaths a year.
Health advocates and environmental advocates welcomed the unexpected change in the course of Prewitt's course.
"It's hard to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from a man who's supposed to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Bird of the Centre for Biodiversity.
"We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
Congress IAAF extended the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The International Association of Light Athletic Federations (IAAF) had voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics (VFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF WFL Restoration Board, which issued a Monday report in which it recommended that the stay be maintained.
There were 166 people voting for the extension of the suspension, vs. 21, handing over the TASS.
The IAAF Board report stated that the WFLA had made considerable progress in reaching the conditions set by the Re-membership Board, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the VFL's disqualification at the London World Cup, Russian athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team consisted of 19 people admitted to IAAF.
The VFL was permanently disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
At that time, Dick Pound, an independent expert from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), published a report describing numerous violations of the Wada regulations by Russian officials and sportsmen.
For more information on the latest report of the IAAF board, see "IAAF has extended the sanctions against VFL".
An obscene defeat
In the third round of the Fonbeth-First Russian FFL team, the newoscopic "Himik" played a retreat against the FC "Koolog".
A little over 10 days ago, the competition played in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was quite different.
The Chemist did not give in to the opponent, but the second-hand relaxation at the end of the match led to an insulting goal and a fiasco.
After a recent defeat from the Calujans with a score of 0.3, many predicted a simple victory for the masters.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the new Ukrainians have forced themselves to be considered and acted against the defence, but from a position of force.
In one inch, the colucians built more and had the advantage of owning the ball.
Another very good match was held by Alexei Syrotin, who repeatedly repelled dangerous blows and gave his partners confidence.
Unfortunately, there was a lack of effort and luck in the Chemic attack to stalled the Kalugi's defence and hit the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to run in counter-curricula.
The New Moscows have been playing more violently in the attack.
The alarming calls for our team were defence errors that allowed the Calucians to create a series of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, the Chemic intercepted a geographical advantage and carried out a number of dangerous attacks.
But Calais' experience has played a role -- they've done the end in a more literal and cold-blooded way, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the Chemic moved the ball to the corner, the pitch of which the owner of the field, without resistance, was moved to the gate.
The goal was written by Yuri Dubrovin.
At the reporting meeting, Chemick demonstrated a pretty good game, but suffered an insulting defeat.
Our team is awaiting another departure: on 11 August, at 19 o'clock, in Moscow, in the "Torpedo" Stadium of Edward Stroeltsov, the new Soviets will fight with the Favorite of the "Centre" FC "Ararat", composed of Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come support the Cheerios!
The location and time of the meeting are 6.30 p.m. outside the Magnolia store (East, D.C., Corp.
Chemica: Syrotin, Manohin (k), Romanchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogya (Oreskin), Doudaiti, Rizov, Saintov, Belarusian (Adojevts), Andreychenko (Ligin)
The Press Service of the Chimik Club
According to published decryptions of telephone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico about payment of the border wall.
The Washington Post published decryptions of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with the President of Mexico, Henrique Peña Niete Trump insisted that he stop publicly saying that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The U.S. President was talking to him about his public speech against the wall, and according to the report, he was saying, "You can't talk to the press."
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern US border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
In a published decryption of his first telephone conversation with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, there was also a hot break.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should accept refugees on their way to Australia was “a funny, repulsive,” and “tupoo” and insisted that because of the agreement made by the Obama administration it would look like an idiot because it intended to stop moving refugees to the US.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation of all day."
The bodies of the tourists who died in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane belonging to Russia, carrying the bodies of the Russians who died in Abkhazia, flew at 8:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, and handed over the TASS.
At the end of the flight, the officers of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's town hall, will meet on board, and the Vice-Minister for Resorts and Touring of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba, will tell the journalists.
Previously, the MES representatives of the Republic stated that all costs associated with the transport of the bodies back to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to compensate the families of the victims in the amount of 500 000 roubles.
According to Ahba, the leadership of Abkhazia had expressed its willingness to pay the relatives of the victims of the bombings for their flights and stays in the Republic, but the relatives had only sent to the Republic authorizations to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On 2 August, at about 4:20 p.m. Moscow time, two explosions broke out in the village of the Goodout district of the Ministry of Defence in a storage area of rocket-artillery weapons, followed by the detonation of large-calibre shells and other rounds.
As a result, the storage room was set on fire, causing uncontrollable explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency, two Russian citizens, Helena Polakov, born in 1970, and Helena Timofeyev, born in 1962, were killed on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were wounded with varying degrees of severity in the health-care institutions of the Republic.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, and the rest are released.
A grand jury will study the Russian influence on American elections
Special prosecutor for Russia, Robert Mueller, convened a grand jury in Washington to study Russia's influence on the US President's election in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to examine witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to be charged.
Calling a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect evidence.
One of the topics of the jury investigation, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of the then President's candidate, Donald Trump, with Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitsky.
Mueller himself had previously promised to check the details of this meeting in June 2016.
They've already been examined by the F.B.I.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had increased the number of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. had previously told me that he had been waiting for a compromise on a candidate's office from the Hillary Clinton Depot, but no documents had been presented, and the conversation was about adoption.
At the beginning of August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.'s statement of meeting with Veselnitsky was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House said that the president had not dictated anything, but merely used his authority, which any father would have done.
Vice-Penza was arrested at work.
The deputy head of the Penza administration, Irina Shirchina, has been detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at its place of work, reports to RIA News.
No official reports have been received from the law enforcement agencies on this matter, but the UK Press Service has assured that they will soon follow.
There's no comment on what's going on at the Penza City Hall.
Irina Shirchina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been in charge of urban planning and land relations since April 2015.
Before that she had been working for a long time as the head of the Department of the State for the Pensen Region.
Irina Shirzyna raised three underage children, and it was remarkable that once again as a mother a year ago, she had given up her maternity leave and had returned to work.
Of course, Mexico does not have a launch vehicle or a launch vehicle.
But there is a space agency set up in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bench is a tribute to the first person who's ever been in space.
Unlike Soviet monuments, which are being demolished in some countries, Gagarin's monuments are, on the contrary, "walking around the planet."
In 2012, a monument was erected in the United States of America in the vicinity of NASA's former head office.
In London, a monument was erected on the Royal Observatory to mark the 50th anniversary of the first flight to space.
There's a monument to Gagarin in Germany in Erfut, where our cosmonaut was in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Warach, Czech Republic, escaped the destruction in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city centre to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin's 70th birthday, a monument to Yuriis Gagarinsu appeared in Riga.
That's the name and name of the first spaceman in Latvian, and he looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: activists lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice
The Ford Mercury of 1948 passed by a crowd in the village of Munro, Georgia, and rushed roaringly to a small Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver was approaching the bridge, a group of white men with rifles prevented it from going.
The boss, a middle-aged man wearing a suit of thin stripes, pulled a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The insiders trembled with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!" the man exclaimed.
"Get him out of the car!"
The piercing screams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene that took place on July 22 is just a mockery.
But when they put a loop around Roger's neck, almost all the audience actually kept their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night in which the dolls lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothea Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey, in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that no one has been arrested in all these years -- though we see them next to us; though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the performance.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brussels is a former member of Georgia's Congress, who's been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monrovia that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want an investigation, we want a conclusion, we want a cure, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we've got justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the lynch victims at the Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the F.B.I.N. News, over 50 people in Monrovia and neighbouring counties were suspected of engaging in lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
While suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights advocates say that in the city they have always been familiar with two linked motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court's decision allowed for the first time black citizens to vote on the premiere which was due to take place that summer.
About the same election, according to the F.B.I., black user Roger Malcolm struck in a fight with a knife from Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman.
Brooklyn says that according to rumours in town, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorota's wife, and that the baby she was supposed to have wasn't from her husband.
According to the F.B.I., on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landlord, paid $600 in bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothea and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove from prison and drove up to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and directed Harrison's murders," that's the conclusion in one of the F.B.I. reports.
"It is also evident that there was a collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies, who not only took part in the murders but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identities of the witnesses."
Well, that's what the Brooklyns call a shorter one.
"It was an attempt at voting rights," he said.
"They were all killed to send a signal to the blacks in town: if you register and vote, you'll be the same."
For nearly ten years, Cassandra Greene runs an annual show that reproduces that lynch at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is observable, he captures the audience, and he talks about the deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America.
It's hard to see and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks that's what matters.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's trials because they show us our own uglyness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
The rehearsal of this year began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 players -- dozens of whites, the rest of blacks -- gathered in the room and listened to the years-old review of the play.
Wade Marbo was a director with Greene.
He's been the main member of the clan for years, but he says it's never been easier.
"I think I'm dirty because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at the time."
In the room, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Ruscon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife, and shouts and pushes him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
He's shouting back to Ruscon.
It's blowing.
And at the same moment, everybody (at least all black actors) is fascinated with a laugh.
Green laughs louder than anybody else.
"What is it," asks Ascona.
He's concerned and embarrassed.
Am I overplaying?
"No," says Greene through the laughter.
"I just don't think the white people were saying nigga."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You must say hard 'r'."
And the energy in the room is changing, and discomfort is changing by the sense of companionship.
Everyone has to do the right thing, not just for the play, but for the memory of the four killed.
The scene starts over.
This time, when Ruscona speaks the word "n," it turns out to be clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and sings a sad song by Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
A hundred yards away, half a dozen spectators are wiped out of their eyes with tears and sweat.
There's almost the same number of blacks and whites among the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to watch the show; many live very close.
They all endured Georgia's heavy perfume for almost eight hours while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to Malcolm's and Dorsey's graves.
So far, the murder has remained history, but now that they're standing at the same place as the people lynched, it seems like their ghosts are in the air right now.
When the last note of the song fades, Greene invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children bow to their heads, touch the blood paint, and the motionless bodies, and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy whispers, as if to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience, and all of a sudden it's over.
Actors throw ropes off their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, the man in the costume who played the main clown.
Nick Ruscone embraces two other actors and suddenly, weeping, falls into their arms: the emotional strain of the performance finally hit him.
"All right," whispers one of the women.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had your reasons for that."
Later, the audience sits down for dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta lively discusses the performance with a black couple they just met.
Denisa Daplinski hardly finds words to describe how she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, dreadful words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"Next I think lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now is it called the police shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembered his work as a human rights defender for food, had received general attention.
He says he's already started planning next year's presentation.
"The plot encourages us, because it not only describes the horror of what we've been through, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined Navany for breaches on the "Administrative Saturday"
The Simone Court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 roubles for disturbing the organization of the rally.
The opponent was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20.2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, “Recurrence of the organization of the rally”.
Earlier, the judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Hizir Moussakaev, had completed the administrative proceedings against Leonid Volkov, the head of the staff of the opposition, Alexei Navalny, who had been tried under the same article as Navalny.
The wolf was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Moussakaev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the "agitation Saturday" which the advocates of Navany held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
After seeing the agitated material, the officers following the Saturday night saw that the organisers deliberately concealed its true nature, a public action (which requires a prior request for permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volgov and his lawyers Ivan Jodnov and Alexander Anointev requested that the administrative proceedings be terminated due to the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had made some mistakes in the preparation of the report.
On the most "agitative Saturday" of the week, Volkov was not apprehended, but he received a summons to appear at the police station to report on an event which he had held with his active participation.
The same summons were received by Navany and another fellow oppositionist, Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordovia, the bride and three wedding guests were arrested.
The court in Mordovia arrested a local citizen who had shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported to the National Bureau of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29th.
During the fighting, a 42-year-old resident of Saranska shot several times at guests who had come to the village pond to bathe.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been brought under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code, article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraph 2, (a), (e), (and) (an attempt to kill two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner for hooligan reasons).
According to Interfax, the local media reported that a man had opened fire because the guests of the wedding had decided to bathe and had passed through his district to the pond.
Minergo will tighten supply requirements for turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for the supply of information by providers of critical equipment such as turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, hydroelectric turbines, oil transfer facilities and oil production are launched, equipment providers will be required to share data on access with Minenergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
A draft government decree has already been prepared and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect the "critically important energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
The document identified potential threats such as access to information and management by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and entities, bad partners and hackers.
The European Union has increased anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
On August 4th, the EU Press Service announced that the anti-Russian sanctions had been extended due to the Simens Turbines scandal in Crimea.
This was previously reported by the Week's Architectures.
The EU Council Press Service stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been increased due to the Simens Turbines scandal, which had allegedly been brought to Crimea in order to circumvent the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and suggestions from member countries to extend anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously reported that the final decision would be made before the end of the day, and the decision was made; the sanctions against Russia were extended.
Pearson reduces an additional 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, a British education group, Pearson, announced that it would reduce an additional 3,000 jobs and reduce the advance dividend by 72 per cent as a result of the launching of a new re-engineering programme to address the problems that their business faces.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fallon's head of company, will mostly take place in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs that were shortened during the previous reconfiguration.
Pearson announced that it was planning to cut the cost by another 300 million pounds (US$ 394 million) in May during a third cost reduction programme to try to revive the business that had hit the fast transition to digital learning methods.
The company, which had agreed last month to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner, the Bertelsmann firm, said that its projections for the year had remained unchanged after it had announced an increase of 1 percent in the first half of the year in the sales of the main product to £2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: a soldier named Nato died in a suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber had attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, as reported by the North Atlantic Organization (ONUCA).
According to untrusted local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the town of Karabagh.
This explosion is the last one that struck Afghanistan this month with the bloodbath: on Tuesday, more than 30 people died in the bombing in Herat's Moslem.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to a report by the United States of America, a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a man-portable IED.
All wounded are reported to be in stable condition and to be treated at the United States military hospital at Bagram airport.
The correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabagh is the main source of concern for the NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to UN reports, there were at least 1662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017, about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bombing in a car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had launched the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people, the most serious human casualties in the country since the United States-led military withdrew the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence has highlighted the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump estimates whether there is a need to increase the number of U.S. military forces that are assisting the military and police forces in the country.
According to correspondents, the attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its course of behaviour, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Authority, after legal action, revokes the decision to defer the adoption of the air pollution law
The United States Environmental Protection Agency overturned the decision to defer the adoption of the Obama-era law, which requires states to limit air-polluting emissions one day after 15 states have sued the agency because of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "Ozone Measurements - 2015," highlighting that this step showed the agency's willingness to work with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and responsiveness with our partners in the states," said the head of the Environment Protection Agency, Scott Prüitt.
In June, Prüitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to defer the measurement of the existing air pollution in different parts of the country to determine where to reduce it to meet the stricter air purity standards by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, along with the D.C., filed a complaint alleging that this intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is attempting to reverse the wide range of environmental protection regulations introduced by the previous President, Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme focused, according to Trump, on brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has led to resistance on the part of the democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environment Protection Agency website says that the use of air containing the ocean "can worsen lung function and increase respirator symptoms," such as as asthma.
European Business Association has spoken out against new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures can seriously reduce production and employment.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, so free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon the heads of State and Government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
MPs ask the police to restrict traffic on the shore in Pskov
The Pskov People ' s Choices sent a message to the head of the UVD on the town of Sergei Surin concerning the problem of movement along the shoreline of the Great River.
Parliamentarians Constantine Bolotin, Gregory of the Party, and Valery of the Foresters believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
They felt that driving control would help to make the area more secure and secure.
The problem is that the intruders ignore the signs of the footpath and drive freely along the coast.
It turns out that major repairs and improvements have been carried out in vain.
The sports and children's playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, the main coastline is followed up by officers from the PPP motorboat and the maids in the evening.
They reduce the number of driving cars, but do not completely stop.
Poetin ordered the investigation authorities not to remove hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Poetin suggested that the investigation authorities should not be allowed to remove servers and hard drives from the company's computer.
This was announced by the Head of State at the meeting on investment programmes in the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary to “delete the investigation of measures leading to the shutdown of businesses, including the removal of hard drives from desktops and servers”.
Poetin pointed out that if the investigators had such a need, “it is sufficient to remove the copies, assure them and use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that it is not possible to “create conditions that prevent the continuation of the business until tax is impossible”.
Olga Bouzova told me how much she wanted to call her ex-husband.
Olga Bouzova, a TV announcer, admitted that she really wanted to call Dmitri Tarasov's former husband.
Nowadays, a celebrity is located in the U.S., where it deals with work.
Just the previous day, Olga went to Las Vegas and then decided to publish a post on the Instagram social network.
She reported that she had not married, had not made any new tattoos, nor had she called her ex-husband to say that he had ruined her life, although she was eager to do so.
Busov said she'd remember this trip forever because she had a great fun.
British actor Robert Hardy died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Cornelius Fadge's Minister of Magic in filming a series of Harry Potter novels, died in 1992.
This was reported by the Independent newspaper on Thursday.
The actor's death was reported by his relatives.
They said he had lived "a huge life of success in film, theatre and television for 70 years of his career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in Cheltenham, England.
He played with Lawrence Olivier on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in "The Coriolan Tragedy".
Hardy was also remembered by the repeated performance of Prime Minister Winston Churchill's role, including in one of the screenshots of Agatha Christie's works about Miss Marple.
For his role as Churchill in the BBC "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981), he received the British Academy of Film and Television (BAFTA) prize.
Robert Hardy also had to act as President of the United States on several occasions.
Something went down in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with her crowning wife, Queen Margrethe.
It's a golden wedding this year, but on the agenda of the couple, it's not about preparations for the celebrations, it's about a win-win argument.
His highness refused to be a prince-consort, and he made a sin at the Queen that she had never received a king-consort title.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains the official wife of the Queen.
MlD Russia called on Washington to stop whispering Moscow
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, the Russian Federation responded to the statements made by Mike Pens, who accused Moscow of attempting to destabilise the Baltics.
The relevant statement by the foreign policy department was distributed some time ago.
In its comments, the MFA indicated that the United States is increasingly using cold-war strains, which are not appropriate to the present-day reality.
In addition, Russian diplomatic officials called on the United States authorities to stop moaning the Russian Federation.
As the "Arguments of the Week" wrote the previous day, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of attempting to destabilise the Western Atlantic and to organize a failed government in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomatchenko are dating for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive match.
Basili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be steadily moving towards the most exciting boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the ESPN office in Los Angeles, until Garcia, a hardweight World Boxing Council champion, walked through the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, a World Boxing Organization champion in the second half of the weight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the four-weight world champion, Erian Broner, on Saturday, on Showtime, both boxers are included in the top five boxers, regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Michael Marriga on Saturday at seven o'clock in the ESPN channel.
When the boxers were posing for the picture, the manager of Lomachenko Egis Clemas noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be exactly the right thing to do.
"I used to be half lightweight," reminded Garcia.
"I'm up for the Brokener's sake [up to £140], but I'm not that big.
I'm a little small for 140.
I want to get down to half an easy one.
And he needs to get up to half a mile [to £135], and then we'll have a fight.
That's what fans want.
Let's do them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boks needs this fight."
Climas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of the strategy he maintains for Lomachenko to hold his debut match at a weight of 135 later this year to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0,30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting with the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the world champion in lightweight at the Forum on September 23, 2005.
"The fight may be at the PPV because all the fans have asked for it," said Garcia, expressing later a willingness to fight the channel that would offer the best financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other names will be of such interest.
As soon as they're ready...'
Garcia said he considered Lomachenko to be a "baby boxer" and might attend his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko did not immediately give Garcia a compliment and said that he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on showing the force of the blow and then boxing.
They both said they felt the strain growing before their own battle.
"This fight must take place.
No other fight is so much of an interest and conversation.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
On several central streets Moscow will shut down for the weekend
On this weekend, 5 and 6 August, the movement will be restricted in the capital, on the section of Tver Street, from the Nastasian alley to the Triumph Square, as well as on the 1st Tver-Yama Street.
In addition, the road will be closed on Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tver-Yama Street.
At all sites the overlap will operate on both strips, as reported by the Transport Department information centre in Moscow.
The streets will be closed from midnight on 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August, due to improvements.
Also during the weekend, traffic will be closed on a section of the Moscow Coast.
There's still construction of the charge park.
Poetin asked the prosecutor's office to check on the Baykale.
Russian President Vladimir Poetin has instructed the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Russian Federation to conduct an investigation into the area of Baycala for illegal and ecologically dangerous activities.
"Request the Office of the Director of Public Information to check the facts of illegal and ecologically dangerous activities in the Bay of Wales," said Vladimir Poetin at a meeting devoted to the environmental development of the region.
Moreover, the Russian leader requested that action be taken if the facts of the violations were found.
New test results published to estimate the age of asylum-seeker in Sweden
Recent tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden, who had been subjected to a new method of medical age evaluation, showed that over 80 per cent of the tests had been evaluated as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trusted the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age estimate in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the real age of some refugees who declared that they were minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensics Department has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent of the tests were evaluated as persons aged 18 or over, while in 25 more cases the Forensics Bureau estimated that the test was "probably 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was probably under 18.
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of a person is doubtful.
According to Johan Guernsson of the Forensics Bureau, the results are consistent with those of the past months.
"We don't see much difference in statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite the same," he said to the "The Local" portal.
The high percentage of cases in which persons had been evaluated as having reached the age of 18 did not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers had lied about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases it was "most likely to be 18 years old or older."
However, after examining 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases a person had openly declared that 18 were being implemented this year.
The method used to carry out a medical age assessment, which is to x-ray the teeth of wisdom and tomography of knee joints and to give them to dentists and radiologists, has also led to criticism in some instances.
One of the sceptics is endocrinologist from the University of Carolina, Claude Marcus, whose work is to evaluate people's biological maturity in order to determine whether they have experienced puberty before or later.
"I've had reasons to think about it, and I don't think I should use the methods of measurement that are currently in use.
The biological age is thus very imprecise.
If we can't define it with confidence, we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to the newspaper “Metro.
However, Geransen, from the Forensic Medicine agency, said in favour of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, one can say that the risk of taking a child wrongly as an adult is small.
We face the greatest risk when we're about 18 years old, in which case it's about 10 percent."
I'll see if I can run for president.
During his work trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Poetin announced that he would like to consider whether to run for President of Russia for elections in 2018, he would like to send Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request made by the inhabitants of the village of the Buryatsk region.
During a video conference on the destruction of the Fire in Buritia and Irkutsk oblast, the interviewer asked Poetin to say, "Vladimir Vladimirowitsch, we have a request to you: when the next election of the President comes, we all ask you to run for office again."
"All right, I'll think about it, thank you," the President replied.
On 28 July, the Russian President's Spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, remarked to some media outlets that Vladimir Poetin's election office would be headed by President Anton Wyno, President's Chief of Administration.
Sandov called these assumptions "nothing based on hypothetical reasoning."
"As long as there is no head office, until the establishment of the head office is far, to the campaign is far away," said Sandov.
"Until it's on the agenda," said Sandov.
The governor of West Virginia said he was going to another party.
The governor of West Virginia, Jim Justiz of the Democratic Party, announced on Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he was moving into another party.
"Do you like it or not, the democrats have moved away from me," said the governor of Justice.
"Today I speak to you with many prayers and reflections... today I tell you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of any use to you as a democratic governor."
The meeting exploded with applause.
"So tomorrow I'll change my registration to a Republican," added Justice.
"As a coach, I would tell you that the time to play is different."
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with a 42 percent win, and Justice did not support the Democratic party's candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that "The transition of governor Justice to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which prevents rather than works to make our country great again."
“Taking into account only 15 governors and controlling the smallest number of state governments in history, the statement of the governor of Justice is just another renunciation of a party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” reported CBS News, a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronn Macdeniel.
Cat heavyweight by the name of Mr. Beauty found the house thanks to social media.
A pet in Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat named Mr. Belle, who weighs over 14 kilograms, after he became famous on the Internet.
This is reported by Massable.
At the end of June, a photograph of a cat was published on Facebook, asking him to find his owner, because "it's obviously someone who used to feed him."
In comments, users suggested that animal face expression might become a new meme.
The publication has attracted more than 32,000 liquor and 15,000 comments.
In comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to shelter Mr. Belle.
As a result, it was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take over her weight.
In an interview with WNCN, an American woman said that she had had a similar experience: she took home a cat of about 10 kilograms, and now she weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with extremely long paws.
The animal photograph post collected over 68,000 views.
The commentators said that she could have made a career in the model business.
Cove lauded Russia's “really” apology for the doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, an international athletic athletic specialist on Thursday, commended what he called the Russians' honest apology for the doping scandal, but repeated that now was not the time to allow the country to take part again in sporting events.
The Russian representative of the Light Athletics Federation, Dmitri Schlachtin, reported at the International Association of Light Athletics, which had been held on the eve of the world championship in light athletics, that the removal of his country from sports was fair and that he was determined to combat doping.
He apologized to "all the sportsmen who had stolen gold and silver coins at the competition."
Despite his comments, the International Association of Athletic Federations had voted to retain the suspension that had been introduced in November 2015, after the World Anti-Doping Authority (WADA) had published a report on the evidence of State-funded use of doping.
“I felt that today's answer, today's report was very frank,” said the President of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations Cove to the reporters.
"All the council and all the convention enjoyed... that the Russian Federation itself acknowledges that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the reconfiguration of the Federation."
Coe said that he also “liked” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reconstruction.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which now is not the time to reinstate Russia,” said Coe.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean sportsmen from the stainted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian sportsmen, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will take part under a neutral flag in the World Athletics Championship, which will start on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met for Russia's reconstruction.
As he reported to reporters in London, following a presentation on the board of the International Association of Athletic Federations, drug testing is still not done enough, and suspended coaches are still doing their job quietly.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of public adultery.
The arrested Ukrainian Security Service (ISU) journalist Basili Muravitski has been arrested for two months and has handed over to the VSA.
A member of the Gitomir Journal of the Internet is suspected of having committed adultery by posting his publications on Russian websites and attacking Ukraine's territorial integrity.
At the same time, Russia does not support the Ukrainian authorities' measures against a journalist, considering it a “barbar policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to make a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
Commandant Borsini's ship entered Libya's territorial waters in order to, together with the Navy of that country, stop the flow of illegal immigrants.
The decision to launch the operation was made by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome had agreed with the international Government of Libya, which, however, did not control most of the country's territory.
The opposing cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobrook accused Italy of breaking Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subjects to resist Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they declared that they did not believe those threats and intended to send another military vessel to the Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks between the Italian premier, Paulo Gentoli, and the head of the recognized European cabinet of Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were published in July on the number of illegals coming from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government had stated that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
Scalable crash occurred in Skype
A global failure in Skype's service was detected today in several countries around the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began to send complaints to the program's developers.
Microsoft stressed that professionals were already actively working to address the problems faced by Europeans and North Americans, and explained the RIA News.
Remember that this June Skype also crashed.
Users have been unable to receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of Ukraine's light athletic team were suspended from participating in the CM
Olga Grounder and Olesha Posch, specializing in short distances, have been excluded from the Ukrainian team for the World Cup in London.
This is reported on the national Athletics Federation's (FLAU) website.
This decision was made by the organization in connection with the establishment by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings against light-age children.
Trainer Sergei Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspected athletes of using doping.
The oyster is the 2012 World Cup and the 2012 World Cup, and the 2010 European champion at the 4 to 100 meters relay, and the 2012 European premiere winner at the 4 to 400 meters relay.
The London World Athletics Championship will take place from August 4 to August 13.
How the financial rules of football will affect Naymar's move to Paris
Rules designed to prevent unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world record-breaker of Naymar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris St. Germain.
For the UEFA's Paris Saint-Germain, a European football-control authority whose power prevents teams from participating in the prestigious championship league.
From the Financial Fairplay rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, it is clear that the SWF will eventually have to show that Naymar's transfer was financed without significant loss.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) just to get the Brazilian out of the contract, and Naymar will get a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Naymar's move to France.
The SVU can exactly pay off to hire Naymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team from the rich power of Qatar's ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums of money on the purchase of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to achieve a threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
A former French football player believed that clubs that had fallen into huge debt in their quest for success had essentially cheated and risked ruin if banks or owners had stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on the debt of the clubs and instead shifted to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change in the business model originally used by Roman Abramowicz in Chile in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential and then to spend heavily on improving the team and creating a global brand – it became a difficult plan.
For the current three-year period, an estimate of 2018 may cost 30 million euros.
And, despite Platini's shameful dismissal from the presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to restrain excessive spending.
"FFP is probably alive, and we'll move forward and tighten the rules," said Andrea Traverso last week to the Associated Press agency, which controls the FFP in UEFA.
Even though SWF will pay the buy-in of Neumar's contract one time, he may, for reporting purposes, distribute this amount for the entire duration of his contract.
Naymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer value can be shown in annual accounting as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were applied to SWF, as well as to the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
A fine of 60 million euros (at that rate of US$82 million) was introduced by SWF, which was later reduced to €20 million, and was ordered to limit the composition of its team in the championship league during the 2014–1015 season to 21 players instead of normal 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may attempt to outsmart its financial inspection by blowing up their revenue from companies associated with the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company could have offered SWF, if funding were considered to be above the standard market price, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the sum of funding for SWF from the Qatar Tourist Authority had been increased.
It was reported that some of Naymar's income from the SWF could have been paid by the 2022 World Cup Organization Committee in Qatar.
But SWF and Qatar-2022 deny that Naymar will be the world championship's ambassador, and such a manoeuvre could easily be discovered by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions on SWF mean that UEFA will be more closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, people familiar with the situation reported that UEFA did not engage in a pre-discussion with SVU about the Naimar transfer.
They spoke to Associated Press on an anonymous basis because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of SVU.
According to the latest published report, SWF earned more than 10 million Euros in the period from 2015 to 1016 with a return of 542.4 million euros.
The accounting for the last financial year has not yet been published.
SPM expected that the arrival of Naymar would provide a good basis for sponsoring, selling attributes and T-shirts with a team logo.
At the club, it is assumed that trade will grow by at least 30 percent as a result of the employment of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry at the departure of one of the best soccer players, the Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Naymar by saying that the SVU would violate the financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of financial doping, with the club and with the state,” said the Spanish newspaper AS, President La League Javier Tebas, in view of the fact that Qatar is the ultimate owner of the SWF.
Arsen Wenger, who owns an American sports magnate, shares La League's doubts about government funding for the club.
"It's all the consequences of sharing, and it's completely changed the landscape of football over the past 15 years," said Hungarian on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It's getting very difficult to follow a financial fair play because a country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The President will decide the order and place of the oath.
Where and as new Russian citizens would swear their allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President would decide - such changes to the second reading of the relevant law had drawn up a State Duma committee on legislation and Statehood.
A week ago, the MPs planned to determine directly the procedure for swearing in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as disabled children, as follows from the amended text of the changes to the Russian Citizens' Bill (available in the “Ivestiya” list), which the committee will consider on 11 July before the second reading at its meeting.
The idea of swearing an oath upon becoming a Russian national instead of formal signing documents was supported by President Vladimir Poetin on 6 June during a meeting with the Speaker of State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
This idea was presented by the MPs in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the revocation of the decision to grant citizenship to those who have subsequently been convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public incitement to terrorism or its public excuse in the media or on the Internet (art. 2052, para. 2, of the Criminal Code), as well as for the theft of a plane, train or water transport, but only if the act is connected with terrorism (art. 4 of the Code).
According to the bill, his logic was as follows: by issuing citizenship documents, a person is bound by a promise to abide by Russian law - by stepping on the path of extremistism, and by breaking that promise.
The bill in April was submitted to the State Duma by the leaders of the Douma faction, Vladimir Vasiliev (the only Russia), Genady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovski (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (the fair Russia) and the Speaker of the GD Viacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the MPs accepted it on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State and Law approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but it has now been renegotiated.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will set the order of the oath.
Parliamentarians had previously intended to describe the procedure directly in the Russian Citizens' Act, specifying that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the State flag and the Russian flag in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event was to take place - a list of places where a Russian flag could be located was governed by the relevant federal Constitution.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of State of entities, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal government, etc.
It could probably also be the register.
The swearing of a solemn oath to obtain Russian citizenship will take place after the officials have checked their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be obtained after the oath comes from the completed text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text suggests that Russia's oaths will be from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
The rule under which incompetent or restricted persons, as well as those unable to pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath themselves, will be excused from swearing in has been maintained.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to be excused from this procedure and from “other persons”,
The updated bill also provides for a special procedure for the admission of Ukrainian citizens who are considered to be Russian speakers.
They will have to officially abandon Ukrainian citizenship by applying to the authorized body of Ukraine for that purpose.
A notarized copy of the application will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
Revocation of “alien” nationality, as it is, will not be required if this is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the control of the person”.
A group of members, including the First Vice-Speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Clonskaya, Pavel Krachennikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all “One Russia”), had proposed a corresponding amendment to the law.
I think many of you know that it's impossible to get a certificate from Ukraine, that's impossible.
Thus, a great deal of people are waiting to decide their fate with regard to the Russian Federation's citizenship, explained the previous day by the head of the German State and Law Committee, Pavel Krachennikov (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the employment of certain foreign posts would not apply to those who had given up their “other” citizenship in writing and had handed over their previous passport to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but had not ceased to be a foreign national “for reasons beyond their control”.
It is now prohibited for aliens to hold positions in the municipal service, to be employed in facilities and organizations whose activities relate to Russia's security.
Also, a person with dual nationality or a residence permit in another country may not become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
The law was scheduled to enter into force on 1 September 2017 and the necessary by-laws should be ready by that time.
Nostalgia becomes low in "The Hot American Fly" and "The Detective's Companion."
The present iteration of history nostalgically resembles simultaneously the glorious days of the characters in the 1980s; the period of the grunge in the 1990s (sometimes at a time when the distinguished masters David Wayne and Michael Schovalter made a comedy of "State" for MTV); and themselves, that is, themselves, before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and Paul Rudd, went on to more serious things.
As a cultural fact, it is both the elevation and the embodiment of our era, with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not just because of absurd humor (including the original story of a talking jar of vegetables, which was spoken by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached their age; thus, being unable to return to the joke becomes part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have been playing adult games, have less profound emotional roots, and its parody is more systematic and includes rifs from the 1990s' Stalking Films like "Hands swinging the cradle."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four wheel roller skates, and "a lot of other things since 1991."
Many stories are the same.
Soft Coop (Showalter), now a writer, has still not won any reciprocity from Cathy (Marguerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there's a crazy and vile plot in which he's involved, as well as the showalter, which George W. Bush Sr. is now inciting. (A test parody by Michael Ian Blake's execution.)
As always, the best part of the fraternity is to retreat from it.
It's particularly funny to see forever young Rudd sing a song by Matt Dillon from "The Lonesome," a character of which, Andy's old man, is now an old man.
It would be a success of random madness in a sort of recursive series called Seven Up, until it reaches what I think would be a logical conclusion to it: "A hot American summer: twenty years later," where in the last scene the entire company would go to the premiere of the film "A hot American summer."
The "Detective Companion" in the Amazon addresses another type of nostalgia: the memory of the Cold War of the Americans, the "Explorable Blonde," or even the "Glossae" with its images of the East-West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Reese Thomas, is a television film: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The main roles of Gregor and the idealist Joseph are played by Florin Pierresick, Jr., and Cornelius Ulicus, and their dialogues in English by Channing Tatum (also Executive Producer) and Joseph Gordon-Lewitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (a policeman spends time watching a game of chess as Americans can watch football).
A team of famous voices per frame -- including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and chloe Sevigny -- makes it fun to play "puzzle the voice."
But "Comrade Detective" is holding on to the plausible clumsy propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in the mask of Ronald Regan -- which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are prolonged, and funny isn't very often.
If it were shortened, the Companion Detective could better handle his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the United States Embassies, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby, swallowing a bunch of hamburgers.
An imaginary comunistic viewer, this image tells us that Western culture is capable of doing anything to obesity.
The fictional Romanian writers of the film are not so wrong: we do that with our own recent history, and with them too.
The Russian Super Bowl Football Trust between Spartak and the Locomotive will be about 30 million roubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Prime League (RFPL), Sergei Prukin, at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He added that by now there were almost no tickets left for the match.
The Spartak-Locomotive match will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 9:30 p.m.
As the TASS points out, Spartak is an active Russian champion, and the Locomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young officers cleaned the furniture for 200,000 rubles.
Recently, a 37-year-old Ufiman with a furniture firm contacted the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the factory, causing serious damage to its production.
The hunter's tools were a total of nearly 200,000 rubles, two cooking machines, a perforator, a hydraulic, a swan.
The guards of the police began to hunt down criminals and soon came upon the inhabitants of Bashcortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, accomplices broke into the company's premises, broke into the front door and removed the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service they found.
A case of theft had already been brought against them, and law enforcers had managed to return only part of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
State Department comments Medvedev's comments on Russian-US relations
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department, Heather Nauert, in response to the remarks made by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, on the relationship of the two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government had declared that, by imposing new anti-Russian sanctions, the US had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a complete trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert recognized that Russian-American relations are on a "lower level," but said that there was a need to look for "areas of interaction".
"Look at the peace in the southwest of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the US and Russia," quotes the RlA News.
However, a foreign government official refused to comment on the Russian premier's statement that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was signed by US President Donald Trump last Wednesday.
In doing so, he recognized that the document had failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "grown" roses of amethysts and quartz
The jewellery division of the French fancy house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - added to the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collection.
They had five new rings and three rings on velvet tapes.
In the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line, two new rings and a ring of amethysts, pink quartz, and diamonds were produced in glyptics (hand-clicking on a stone) and respect for the 70th anniversary of the home.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Vittoire de Castellan was inspired by roses growing in his estate in Granville by the designer Christian Dior, and by the gardens of Bagathel and Pre-Catelan in Paris.
Trump found the culprits of the decline in relations with Russia
The U.S. President, Donald Trump, criticized the members of the Congress sharply.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a decline in relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank the convention, these same people can't even give us medicine," wrote the president on Twitter.
The previous day, he had signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
These will affect Russian banks and energy companies in particular.
Subsequently, the White House issued a statement by the President, in which he indicated that the law would prevent the US from entering into lucrative transactions and would bring the Russian Federation, China, and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian businessman refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
A Belarusian businessman, Victor Prokopeny, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of a Sberbank subdivision.
The businessman explained to RBC his intention to “concentrate on our other planned investments and projects on which we are working”.
According to Mr. Prokopeni, this would be a "best investment of time," despite the investment attraction of buying the Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenia became the main purchaser of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortia Gregory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guteriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Peter Poroshenko had introduced sanctions against their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization, apart from the TSA and the External Bank, became Sberbank.
Novok gave the reason for the blackout in Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy, the Russian Federation has named the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
Alexander Nowak, the head of the department, explained the matter.
He said that the peninsula was powerless due to an accident in the Krasnodar region.
The truck crashed into the power lines, resulting in the shutdown of Cuban and related criminal networks.
Electricity failures in large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The experts corrected the problem within a few hours.
Initially it was reported that blackout could be caused by an anomalous heat.
Bank of England will keep interest rate at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weaker economic growth and weaker inflation have caused rumours of possible increases to subside.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain slow, and left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family income.
The bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) voted with a score of 6 to 2 for keeping the rate at 0.25 per cent, with a smaller number of members voting this month for an increase because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, and warned that pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the fall.
However, the bank warned that an increase in interest rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation caused by the crisis, and said that it was likely that loan costs would have to be raised more than expected in the financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the huge package of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of the crisis.
Starting next February, the bank will close an emergency financing plan for which it provides banks with cheap credit, although it has reported that it now has to provide an additional 15 billion pounds, up to 115 billion pounds, under the plan.
In the interest-rate protocol, the bank said: "According to the MPC's main projections, the growth of gross domestic product (GNI) remains slow in the near future, while pressures on real family income continue to affect consumption."
On the issue of rates, he repeated that in order to halt inflation, there would be a need for “several tightening of financial policies” at a “slightly larger” level than expected by the markets.
Now markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all promotions would be “progressive” and “limited.”
The bank's projections for this and the following year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The bank had kept its projections constant by 1.8 percent in 2018.
After that news, the sterling fell in relation to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent discouraging growth rate weakened the increased expectation of an increase; GDP then rose by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest report on inflation gave little reason to rejoice at the households affected by high inflation and very slight wage increases: the bank said that pressure would increase before it dropped.
The bank added that financial policies “can't prevent” a fortune in the next few years, but expected wages to be restored “significantly” by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also determined to grow as a result of the growing demand for British goods due to the low rate of the pound, which compensates for part of the reduced consumption costs.
The decision was made a year after last August's rate was reduced to 0.25 percent after the shocking results of the EU exit referendum, which led to a fall in the pound.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision on the rate, there was a growing noise around the anticipated rate increases, as inflation was straining heavily pressured households, with three committee professionals asking for an increase to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation dropped to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that it was expected and recovered again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate than the 2% projected is entirely due to the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco's Mortgage Brokers, said: "If you take into account the recent fall in Swap, it seems that the market will become even more competitive again, as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end of the year.
The market is particularly favourable for those who are approaching the end of their existing compacts, as re-financing of credit, often with the possibility of a lack of commission, as well as a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.
The Public Health Service will provide a disputed HIV drug for 10,000 people
Beginning in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for the prevention of HIV after a battle in the High Court for funding the drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-exposure prevention of HIV (PREP), a pre-sex pill that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year trial period by about 10,000 people.
It agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal had approved a High Court decision last year, which argued that the National Health Service had the possibility to pay for the PPE, despite its claims that it should be financed by the local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was described as "the most important innovation" by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National Authority for the Control of the Spread of AIDS (NAT) called it "the turning point."
Before the full launch of the program across England, by April 2018, VSs in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and more doctors will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a pre-sex drug course to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that PPE significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When you take pre-sex education into your body, there are enough certain drugs to prevent infection with HIV.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
The patients eligible for medication include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender persons and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Disponents will select suitable participants who have accepted to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender persons and persons whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is restricted by anti-retroviral therapy.
People who live and are assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest STD who participates in the program.
The program will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England has signed a drug contract this week after an international tender for purchase.
The study is designed to evaluate all the capabilities of the PEPOs by collecting clinical data on who the target audience of the drug is, on its absorptiveness and on its large scale.
“This critical innovation must complement and reinforce the widespread and ever-successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of the NAT, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PEPO, if properly targeted at people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at risk of HIV, through a study carried out in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new opportunity tool that can be controlled by a person without having to discuss it with a partner, which will improve many or many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Ian Greene, the president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The first thing to do is to make sure that the test quickly rolls around the country and that no one at risk of HIV is forgotten.
Now that we've been provided with an experimental PPE drug, we're going to protect over 10,000 people at risk for HIV."
The Shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgson, said: "We very much welcome the beginning of the PEPO test, which was very late because of months of delay and delay on the part of the government."
Data shows how revolutionous this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing and halting the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the advantages of PEAP.
It is now important that the test be rolled around the country as soon as possible to protect those at risk of HIV and to move us one step further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
The World Tatar Congress adopted a resolution on support for the Tatarstan-Russia compact
The sixth meeting of the World Tatar Congress (CPT) adopted a resolution in which it highlighted the importance of maintaining the office of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positive form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic and representing the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
The meeting also underlined in the resolution the importance of a power-sharing agreement between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he had “a positive role in the ethnocultural, social, economic and social and political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
Recall that the Moscow-Kazania agreement was concluded for a period of 10 years since 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, members of the State Council of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to keep the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only entity in the Federation that has a deal with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called the President.
In Russia, it was difficult to get an international driver's license.
The HIELD subdivisions suffer from a shortage of international driving permits (IDPs).
In order to obtain such rights, it takes a few weeks to wait, which has become a real problem for vacationers who wish to take a vacation abroad with their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains contradictory.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written on the national certificate, as it was explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights were set out in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights were recognized in countries that had ratified the Vienna Convention.
In fact, however, everything depended on a specific police office or rental office: some required an IDP and some had sufficient national rights.
To be sure, drivers of international rights do get, but it should be borne in mind that in non-ratifying countries (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IDPs.
Currently, there is a problem with the forms in almost all parts of GIELD, reports the Committee, having carried out a study in a number of regions.
For example, in Moscow, the OCHADD units have simply not issued a ticket, and the forms have been missing for four months.
You can make an appointment on the public service website, but that's where the queue has spread to mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get the IDP "for technical reasons" without getting into the details, and in the Samara region it is honestly said that there are no forms, a similar situation is taking place in other cities.
Many Moscows have already encountered the problem, and social media are becoming more and more aware of this:
Irina Burmitrova said, "Wait, why can't you get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because all of the HIELD offices have run out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question to people who know!"
We need to get international rights very quickly.
Moscow is always far ahead, and the stamps don't give up at all (buttons do not, but can't).
It seems like a public service porter shows that the Time Break is free to shit.
Have you ever tried to get in another town?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for international driving permits have changed, so new forms are being supplied to the State Office.
This may be the result of a shortage, but it is not clear what changes are involved, nor has it been previously reported.
The forms purchase the Special Road Safety Centre (SOC) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supply them to the HIELD units.
In recent years, all the contracts have been concluded with the Goznák AO: in 2014 - 2015, nearly 200,000 IDP forms were manufactured; in 2016, 15,000 forms were bought; in 2017, 90,000, but the last contract was concluded with the First Printing Court GLO on 18 July for the production of 70,000 forms.
There's a theory that the NPR just didn't make the tender in time, and that's why there's a shortage.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people have begun to drive to cheaper Asian countries rather than Europe, China, Thailand, and so on.
What rights are accepted there is not entirely clear, so people are overprotected, so there's a huge demand for international crusts.
It has recently become apparent that professional drivers will have to take an examination to prove their skills.
Mintrans made this suggestion.
The new international driving licence (IDP) has been in effect since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Ukrainian Minister of Justice, Paul Petrenko, said that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4th, he spoke about it in an interview with the Spectator Portal.
No international company that respects itself will even put a bolt or a hooker there because it risks losing its business on EU, US, and Japan, in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
"That is, in my profound conviction, there is actually no prospects for this project," said Petrenko.
He added that he considered Russia unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot properly build smaller objects.
I know that since the Sochi Games, whole stadiums have begun to collapse.
"So I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have proven to be shortsighted enough to join this project," said the official.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of a car arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerchen shore, a large-scale assembly of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed: the bridge is closed at a height of 45 metres from the base of the design.
"One-time bridge builders have prepared a railway arch to be installed on fairway supports," reported the project information centre.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Poetin that the construction of the site was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula to the Krasnodar coast.
In Spain, an official who had not been to work for 10 years was fired
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the head of Spanish official Carlos Recio have?
The permanent hibernate lasted 10 years.
However, Mr. Recio was still dismissed.
But not by his immediate boss.
Things that don't happen in the bureaucratic world.
The lodgers seem to have been accustomed to all sorts of "people's services."
However, officials are constantly able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, a staff member from the archival office of Valencia Carles Resio managed to stay away from work for ten years.
However, he was regularly paid.
And the whole thing is 50,000 euros a year.
And then Mr. Recio's "magic times" ended.
He was dismissed by a decision of the Valencia Parliament.
In the investigation, it was found that an angry walker came to the office every working morning at 07:00 to report to the electronics system.
And then he went home.
He appeared again at 4 p.m. to report back to the system that he had left.
That's 10 years.
It was also reported that all the free time the walker spent drawing comic books at home.
The members of the Valentine Parliament are now thinking about how to punish Mr. Recio's immediate superior, who could not help but know how to work actively in his place of work.
Judges Offer protection from Presidents
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (CPDH), on behalf of Vladimir Poetin, has drawn up proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch of government.
The HRW suggests that the powers of the presidents of the courts be restricted and that they be elected.
For the Courts of Appeal and Cassation, the HRW wishes to introduce special districts which will not be attached to the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its Presidential proposals.
The HRW has completed the development of proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Poetin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the council.
At a meeting with the Council on 8 December 2016, some cases of arbitrary trial were discussed, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see the "OJ" of 9 December).
The work of the HRW has resulted in 25 suggestions, which relate both to the independence of judges and the detection of miscarriage of justice, as well as to the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights advocates was to restrict the powers of the presidents of the courts in order to improve the independence of the rest of the judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge had successfully passed the competition and had received the support of the judicial community, the President of the Court, in the opinion of the Human Rights Council, should submit him for appointment without having the right to refuse, as the law currently permitted.
It is also suggested that the President should not be allowed to assign cases to the judges.
Doing this, experts admit, can be a specially written computer program.
The Human Rights Council also considers that the President is not entitled to “predetermine the results of the judge's qualification, initiate disciplinary proceedings against him or her, or decide on the establishment of additional financial payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to proceed with the “election of the Presidents of the Courts by the judges themselves” and to “enter their powers for a relatively short period of time with a binding rotation”.
All presidents of the courts (from Republican to District) are now appointed by the President for six years on the proposal of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect the judges from the pressure of the Regional Administrations, the HRW suggests that the appeal and appeal be re-organised before the ordinary courts.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRW states that “there is a need to ensure that individual courts of appeal and appeal are organized not at the level of the Regional Courts in the Russian Federation but in the Districts”.
The experts take as their basis the practice of the arbitral courts.
They have “judiciary districts” which do not match administrative division in the Russian Federation, but which thus guarantee greater independence from the regional officials who have difficulty using the “telephone” right.
The SRV peace judges suggest that they be reinforced by the people's jury to deal with some of the “civil and administrative categories” with them.
For example, the denial of parent ' s rights, the restoration of employment, the protection of honour and dignity, the denial of driver ' s license, etc.
"These are just our suggestions," explained the "OK" member of the SRL, the retired judge of the Constitutional Court of Tamara Morsjakov.
She also recalled that the President ' s appointment concerned not only the HRC but also the Supreme Court (JC) which had not yet made its suggestions.
There is still time to carry out the task with the military (including the prosecutor-general and the human rights commissioner in the Russian Federation).
To inform Vladimir Poetin of the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the Russian Federation, the President of the armed forces, Vyacheslav Lebedev, is expected to do so by 1 September.
Living a high life: half floors and clever designs have turned this little apartment in Earls Court into a spacious dwelling.
Joan Lee, a former banker interested in real estate repairs, moved from a large house in Nightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a pretty model house like Queen Anne, and in favour of the new design says that Joan didn't pack her stuff and moved away again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger square," says Joan.
"I was looking for something compatible with my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were also high ceilings here.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price the same day."
Since the first view, an apartment of 1,000 square feet has been completely rebuilt.
Originally, it was an apartment with one bedroom of complex planning – to get into the bedroom, to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and half floors to extract the maximum benefit from the generous height of the ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my demand,' she said.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill Architecture Designer studio "Duck & Shed" to use the ceilings 12.5 feet high and to create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project but would fit Joan to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-storey where you could stand completely.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the breeze.
"Working with steel designs is very difficult," he explains.
"We had to place the premises so that they were one over the other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to bend the design so that it would be at the right height and allow the spaces to be used from the top and bottom."
This decision enabled Erfan to set up two full-sized rooms one above the other in the space reserved, and a lot more interesting.
From half floor through the vintage copper light window, the Retrouvius opens a view of the luxurious living room below.
Mirror furniture with gold finishes, silver accents, and vintage lighting devices from Serge Muya set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding sight, space and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protection panel seems to be a window to the other room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinets are used to store all of Joan's dishes.
To create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the growing kitchen.
The unique thing about this kitchen is that it's a sliding door up, like in the garage.
"The engineering was involved here," Erfan said about the reinforced steel of a wooden fibrous shield door.
"It is fitted with a counterweight, so when you push a door up, it slips very easily."
Thanks to the prudent use of storage space and space, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom, and improved planning.
"In the end, the floor area is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your property is estimated to be," Erfan says.
"Seriously speaking, the real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the sex square."
Here they have been able to increase the floor area using quality materials that give space a shade of luxury.
"Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the house," Erfan says.
"No one falls in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't touch the strings of our hearts."
This suggests that a good design and an extended metre can turn the apartment from something normal into something amazing.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a cultural policy commission
The Russian Government had approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The decree is published on the government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to cultural policy implementation.
The commission will also draft a cultural policy strategy, specify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
The Head of the Commission was the Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
In 2016 the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, approved a plan for the implementation of the State cultural policy strategy until 1930.
The plan includes 193 activities and provides for measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries and to preserve the common cultural space and cultural heritage, and will help to create conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries decreased to a minimum of eight years
The Wall Street Journal, referring to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), reports that the rise in consumer prices in the G20 countries has fallen to the minimum in the last eight years.
OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2%, with lower inflation in October 2009, when the price index was 1.7%.
Rossstat previously reported a drop of 0.1% in the Russian consumer price index.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The rate of inflation in Russia is calculated by the Ministry of Finance at 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economics estimates, however, that the target value has already been reached -- according to this agency's version, it is 4%.
Poetin warned against the illegal logging of the BiCal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Poetin warned during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural bikeland against the illegal destruction of forests.
In the course of the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donski, indicated that a bill had previously been prepared.
It allows logging during fire destruction, and the government plans to take it in the fall.
The President, in turn, said that the project should be kept under review so that the process of shutting down “not everything shut down in a row”.
Donski remarked that the bill involved monitoring by the MES and the monitoring agencies.
Media: CSU soldiers secretly agree with Donbassa's militia
A regular telephone service has been set up in the Donbassa armed conflict line.
Fighters of the warring parties are constantly communicating with each other on their mobile phones, and this conversation is not known at the head office.
The U.S. military and Donbassa militia have set up communications on their cell phones secretly from their high command.
This is reported by the State party on 4 August, referring to the military operation in Donbassa.
According to the publication, unit leaders are familiar with the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
Communication is not domestic: commands are trying to reach some "tactical arrangements."
Often the result of such conversations is a truce on a certain front.
Journalists learned of cases in which a member of the police received a birthday greeting from his official enemy because of the front line.
The PSD and the NPD and LPD have been sitting in trenches on the boundary line since spring 2014 when Ukraine began a military operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has resented the blocking of U.N.S. statements about attacks on the Russian Federation's Embassador.
In the Russian foreign policy department, the actions of certain Western diplomatic agents are outraged by the blocking press statements of the United Nations Council condemning the terrorist bombings of the Russian Federation's Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Department was reminded that the Russian Embassy in Damascus, for the third time in a month, had been bombarded by Hiat Tahrir Al-Sham (former Jabhat Al-Nusra, prohibited in the Russian Federation) and Falak Al-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community is united in the characterization of Nusra as a terrorist organization and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council call for opposition to this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation stated that “it would seem to be clear that Nusra attacks should be universally condemned and that there should be no ambiguities in the evaluation of attacks against diplomatic missions”.
However, as the Department stressed, “for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council, on the contrary, distorting the tone of objections, concealing the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft Security Council press statement condemning the terrorist attacks on Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital”.
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us should be left to those delegations.
“The most outrageous thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to engage in further acts of incitement and terror, and makes them feel a sense of impunity,” said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and added that “it would not be desirable for these barbarians to have a belief that someone in the Security Council is associated with them”.
Vladimir Poetin argued for limiting the number of unscheduled business checks
Russian President Vladimir Poetin, during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East, said that the number of unannounced business checks should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number scheduled, and that the duration of the inspection should be limited to ten days.
"Unscheduled checks are generally carried out without appropriate agreement with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is agreed with the prosecutor's office; everything else goes on its own," quotes the President of the TASS.
Vladimir Poetin also said that investigators should not be allowed to seize the servers and hard drives at the factories.
In addition, according to the President, business associations should be allowed to defend the interests of their members in court.
“It is hoped that it will make some positive progress in dealing with business-related cases or infringing the law on business,” said the Head of State.
Other types of business inspection are increasing as a result of the freeze on scheduled checks, according to OS.
In May, a survey was ordered by the Russian President, Boris Titov, which revealed that scheduled checks had actually been replaced with extra-planned checks (from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutorial examinations (16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raids (7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and civil inquiries (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative inquiries (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).

Brothers fight for a real estate empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million -- forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colleen de Lutis lives at the Torak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who has filed a claim against him in the Supreme Court for a division of ownership and asset.
Paul wants to quit the family business since 2014 but the Supreme Court is still in a violent dispute about the conditions of the divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna's brothers own 87 objects worth over half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded a firm called Westco Jeans, which grew up in a network of 160 commercial places.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's property list today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Coast and Mount Bueller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late father of Colleen, whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant person" of the De Lutis family, he owns about two thirds of the company's asset and Paul owns about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colleen's property is 316 million and Paul's property is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section offered by Colleen gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business, from which Paul thinks Colleen has excluded him.
Colleen claims it's not, but he blames Paul for incompetently managing certain objects.
In the evidence given by Colleen at the beginning of the trial, he said he hoped to settle the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me think of the family as the top priority," he wrote.
The court costs are rising as a snowball: hundreds of pages of evidence, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and the Charter Keck Cramer; both parties have engaged the most famous lawyers, including the Royal lawyer Allan Meyers, and the best handlers.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they have run dairy bars and restaurants, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood where Colleen opened the first family jeans store.
Colleen says he started Westco when he was "in the last classroom of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to hand over their property to their sons without conflict.
"Louisi often told me he didn't want the brothers to be tried in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis's group; she says that Mark got 10 million when he quit the business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their branch."
Colleen was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to a biography published in 2015, was the best friend of a TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Collin and Paul on Friday and their lawyers.
Only Colleen replied with a text message saying that since the case had not yet been tried, "I really have nothing to say."
"I'm very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to lament the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colleen wrote in a statement that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I arguing in court," he said, adding, "already hopes for a solution to the conflict."
On Friday this hope seems to have dissipated.
"The verdict in our case will soon be rendered by the court," wrote Colleen.
The new head of Trump's office plans to limit the access to information to the President.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will actually make it.
Then he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the Chief calmer.
That's what reporter Josh Doe says.
"In a meeting held by the new Chief of the White House, John F. Kelly, and the Chief of the Office on his first working day, he outlined the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through it -- paper or briefing -- because it would be better for the President to make decisions if he received the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is absolutely true, but others have already failed in trying to calm Trump down by tracking the information received.
President Trump's relationship with television took place a few decades ago--and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unjust coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he received fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded," said Sam Nanberg, a former campaign manager in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote at the time in "Politico" that "in the words of six former members of the election staff, in order to control Trump's Twitter habit, it was necessary to make sure that the personal information that came to him contained a constant stream of commendation."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these members of the election staff know something that we don't know -- for example, that, had it not been for them, Trump's tweets would have been even more incipient.
We may never find out about Tweets that Trump hasn't published.
If his officers had saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one ever managed to keep Trump from putting oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival groups, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by supplying Trump with material -- secure or not -- that supports their views.
"Politico" -- just for this story -- wrote in May about the tendency of the councillors to constantly give the president questionable information.
Here's an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Trump's present and former employees say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not calm down until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone gave the president a print-out of an article from GottNews.com, a web site by Charles C. Johnston, in which the deputy head of Cathy Welsh's office was accused of standing behind a nearby leak in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnston is forever banished on Twitter for his aggressive behaviour, that he has failed to present specific facts or that he has in the past launched false charges and then refused them.
Trump read the article and began asking the employees about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that the then Rhines Privacy Chief and the secretary of the machine, Rob Porter, "tryed to build a system to manage and document the flow of paper received by Trump."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do the same.
He may be a more efficient manager than Pribus, but Trump is still impulsive, and his assistants are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Tumen prosecutor's office is fighting against an HIV-dissident
The prosecutor ' s office challenged the decision of the Kalininski Rice Court of Tumeni, which dismissed the criminal case against a local woman who had died of HIV.
The investigation alleged that the child had died because the mother was an HIV dissenting woman and had refused to be treated.
However, the court relieved her of her responsibility in connection with the reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor ' s office believed that the crime could not be left with impunity without setting a precedent for other persons living with HIV.
The case against a Tumenian woman was initiated under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (death due to carelessness) in April, following the death of her three-year-old daughter from HIV infection.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is an HIV-infected woman.
"The woman was not treated herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection," explained the Tumen district prosecutor's office.
The criminal case was brought to the Kalininsky City Court of Tumen, which decided on 25 July to discontinue it.
The father of the dead girl pleaded for it, explaining that "he has forgiven his wife, has no complaints against her, has made up for the damage and has apologized."
The prosecutor ' s office did not accept the court ' s decision and filed an appeal, demanding that the dismissal order be revoked and that it be referred to a new hearing.
The girl died, and it's impossible to repair the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the advice of the doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her against a dangerous infection,” reported the prosecutor's press office.
In the opinion of the monitoring body, it should be punished, otherwise it would be followed by other HIV-dissenters.
According to the Tumen AIDS Center, there are now about 12 children living with HIV in the Tumen region who do not receive health care due to parent failure.
"And this situation has already improved --in a year of work, half the parents who have categorically refused to treat children with HIV have changed their mind -- allowed diagnostics to be done, started taking drugs," said the Spokesman of the Center for Aids, Helena Loseva.
She said that it was not possible to have a legal effect on parents, and as a result not all children living with HIV were found, mothers were prevented from examining them, hiding and running away from hospitals with their children.
The Hazards of HlV Dissenters
At the end of last year, Lutheran sociologists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called movement of people living with HIV.
People who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs are referred to as people who deny the existence of HIV.
Medical professionals and activists in the health services of NCBs call such views anti-medicine, and they are seen as a serious threat in their spread.
A terrible photography that ended with tragedy took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the railway station in Khmelnitsk.
A cheerful company of drunken young people walked by a bridge over the railroad, where a cargo train was standing.
One friend had the idea of making an imaginary selfie on the roof of the wagon, and reported "FACTAM" in the police communications sector in the Khmelnitsk region.
The guy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but due to his indiscretion, he got stuck on the power line and instantly received an electric shock.
Fortunately, this case was reported to the station manager, who immediately called an emergency.
Before the victim's arrival, he was moved to a safe place and then hospitalized in the burn section of the Khmelnitsk District Medical Hospital.
The men were diagnosed with body burns from 1 to 2 degrees.
He's now treated as stable by doctors.
Law enforcement officials recall that recently extreme selfies on the roofs of multi-storey, mobile bridges have become more popular.
The police encourage people to be alert and prevent such photos from happening, especially among children and young people.
Scientists allowed the oceans to exist on ancient Venus
There could be oceans on ancient Venus.
That was the assumption made by French scholars.
Professionals have created a computer model that has demonstrated the formation of water on the planet's surface, and it is written by Science News.
It turns out that in Venus, at the beginning of its history, there were oceans with 10 percent more water than it is now on Earth.
Earlier, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to the scientific hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
In the course of their research, foreign experts concluded that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were wounded in a park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were shot and transferred to the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where a large number of visitors were present.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began to shout threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the intruders could not be seen, since they had all but eyes closed.
Another was provided with medical care, after which he was released.
The third wounded is a minor, no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park Hill is a popular place for locals and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured while shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
A number of other visitors were injured trying to leave the premises.
Louna's rock band will present a new album at Barnaul
The Louna rock band concert will take place in Barnaul on October 17th.
The musicians will present their new album, "The Wonderful New World," which became one of the most expected editions of the year.
The team is producing a concept show that will be the brightest show in the band's concert history.
"The Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is related to the famous novel-anti-topia of O. Haxley's "O wonderful New World."
New songs don't rewrite the book, they talk about a society that lives by the law of anti-Utopia, " blindly believing propaganda and bound values."
The group was helped to collect money for recording the album, with more than 1,200 people supporting the project on the Planet.ru site.
Her first album, "Make Louder!" was released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians introduced the "Time X" album, and in 2013 they recorded the album "We are the Luna".
In the fall of 2015, the Luna band performed a symphony band at the Crocus City Hall with the "Songs of Peace" program.
The group was composed of Lusine Gevorkian (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas-gitara), Ruben Cazarian (gitara), Sergey Poncratev (gitara), Leonid Kinsburski (Arabs).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club Faraon on October 17th, at 7 p.m.
The price of tickets is between 1200 and 2600 rubles.
Luna is one of the requested groups on the Russian rock scene.
The collection was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The band won a number of games in the different hit-orders of the Red Duty.
The gypsies overcame the trenches and returned to the "millionaire street"
Some of the richest landlords in West Midland are again in conflict with the decisive gypsies who have overcame the moor that the municipal authorities have erected in order to re-enter the field near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Sorihalla Street, which was renamed the "Millionaire Street".
With horses, babies, and lots of wheelhouses, they returned after being banished no longer than in May, and were not prevented by a moor dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a rift in the defence structures and shook its vehicles through a section that left untrusted to leave a spot for the path.
The angry inhabitants attacked the city of Solichal, saying that it was “unable to solve the problem”.
An anonymous local woman said, "They came here Monday night after being driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by."
The city should be ashamed and forced to act because it is completely incapable of solving the problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were banished, and they came back again.
Last night more gypsies arrived, and today perhaps more.
"The Birmingham city knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying the city tax, and the city can't even stop it."
One local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, "This is ridiculous, we just saw these gypsies leaving the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues."
This time there were more, and we even saw a horse graze on the meadow."
A representative of Solihalla said: "We know about the illegal ground camp near Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solichal police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible."
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police on the phone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the New World's Champagne Wine Plant.
The PCO of the Republic of Crimea, the New World Champagne Plant, has decided to act by transforming the New World Champagne Plant into the OAO, following an order from the Minister of Property and Land Relations, Krim Anna Anuhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in Crimea's public domain.
The fixed capital of the stock company will be 595.5 million roubles and will consist of 5.955 million shares of nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Crimea, has stated that if no funds are found to upgrade the plant within the next three years, the plant will be threatened with shutting down.
The cost of the plant's basics is between 60 and 70%.
Upgrading a business requires 1.2 billion roubles. Because of the organization and the legal framework, it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of the income to the budget.
What remains is not enough for the implementation of the modernization plan.
"It's difficult to get money from the owner, to talk about the borrowing of large credit organizations," said the head of the Crim Creek Hotel in April this year.
The Parliament of Crimea has included the business in the planning plan for the privatization of the country in 2017.
It was suggested that he be stocked and put on a bid.
The Interfax source in Crimea government estimated the possible value of selling the business to US$40 million, and the investor's investment in upgrading to US$30 million.
The New World increased the production of playing wine by 2.8 percent in 2016, compared to the level in 2015, to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lion Golitsyn as a production plant for playing wine in the New World estate he acquired.
The plant is located on 11 acres of land.
Suburban third graders destroyed more than 40 gravestones
Members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Nizhgorod oblast have identified citizens who have destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the town of Lyskovo.
Intruders turned out to be third-class students.
The first claim that gravestones had been damaged by unknown persons was received by the Russian OMO in the Lyskovski district on 27 June.
A total of 24 people contacted the police in this regard.
As a result, criminal proceedings were brought under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, “Destroy, damage or desecrate places of burial”.
As a result of the investigation, the police found the suspects, two of whom were children aged 8 and 9.
Young offenders told the police that they were interested in watching monuments fall, and that prompted them to commit hooliganism.
Pre-emptive measures have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy has tightened its tone for ships of non-governmental organizations rescued by immigrants.
Italy warned the NGO owned by rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue unless they complied with the new rules regulating their operations.
"If an NGO fails to comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to tell whether they will be able to continue their activities," said the Home Minister Mario Minniti in an interview with the Turkish daily Stampa.
Minnichi's warning came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Retette on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal migration.
The humanitarian organization, which had worked for only a year, had declined to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Kartozio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain the top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to work in the search and rescue zone," states the organization's statement on social media.
"We will only be able to evaluate all the charges now, after we have collected all the information and have an assessment of the situation."
The Italian authorities have been following the Juventa ship belonging to the Jugend Retette since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken a whole rescue boat on board the immigrants whom the traffickers sent directly to them and allowing smugglers to leave with boats which they could use again.
At least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as stated in the prosecution file, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of being in breach of the requirements of the Italian shore authorities, which control rescue operations in this zone, rather out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The code of conduct presupposes, mainly, that a “Juventa”-type vessel will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the Code: Save the Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Pro-Activa Open embraces from Spain.
The latter declared on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary, but accepted, provided that they would not cause any “significant change or interference” with its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is MSF, the MSF, which has won the Nobel Prize.
Meanwhile, Minnichi said that the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of immigrants coming to Italy as a result of rescue operations suggests that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on plans for further discussions with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of immigrants leaving those countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
"In Libya we don't want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict."
The Russian authorities have recently significantly stepped up their policies in the Libyan direction and, with their visits to Moscow, the delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have become more active.
The head of the Russian contact group for an internal settlement under the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, Assistant Head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Degov, told us what the aims of Moscow were in the region and on whom he was betting.
The contact group on Libya that you are chairing is almost unaccounted for.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine -- everybody knows about it.
And here's the curtain to the mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The contact group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
It is run by the Under-Secretaries of Foreign Affairs, Mikhail Bohdanov, and Adam Delimhanov.
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State of Vyacheslav Volodyn.
The reason for the formation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker Chebotarev (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board).
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military experts, representatives of the State Duma, was set up, and our work was supported by the Head of the Chechen Republic, Ramson Cadyrov.
How did you manage it?
Since I have been working for Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our work is not limited to the release of sailors from the Chebotariev Mechanical.
We were able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict, and with Tripoli (which is based on a UN-recognised government led by Faiz Saraj. - "Oz") and with Tobrook (a parliamentary branch that is opposed to the government and supports Marshal Khalif Haftar, who controls the eastern part of Libya. - "Oz").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (the Libyan Vice-Premier, OS), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided that, in order to make better use of these contacts, a contact group should be established.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I wish to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict; we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many are in the contact group and how many are permanently in Libya?
The contact group now has five members.
Among them are people with experience in the military, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include in the team of experts in the region, representatives of the Middle East Rana Institute.
There is no permanent presence of any of our staff in Libya, which is not yet necessary.
Are there Russian military counselors, instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military professionals in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group includes the former military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities that have been closed to a certain point for us, such as Misurata (where militia groups are based that have played a role in overthrowing Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi in 2011 and which have significantly increased in the coming years.
We arrived in Misurat in January this year.
We've been frightened, told that there's a lot of Islamist, terrorist.
But it was important for us to take stock of the situation there, to analyse the real military potential that is responsible for why such rumours are going on, what the real role of Islamists is.
In Misurat, we met with all the elements involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken away from the Russian-prohibited "Islam State"-"UO").
We wanted to see them, meet these people, check out information that they were the ones that played a decisive role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, and not Halif Haftar, who attributed himself to these services.
And what's your conclusion?
Is it not Haftar who won the Islamic State in Libya?
He didn't do it.
Haftar had operations on the other front, in Benghazi.
And with the IG in Sirte, the structures under the government in Tripoli fought.
And by the way, we have invited to Russia the people who carried out this anti-terror operation.
And they came -- the visit lasted from April 19 to April 23, and the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in Duma, MIDE, and Rosgwardia.
You are, as we understand it, in all Libyan regions, and you are probably representing the moods of local elites and military leaders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the cease-fire and the elections reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has been the case repeatedly in the past, the accords will be thwarted, the fighting will resume, the parties will try alone to take power?
For us, the fact that Saraj and Haftar have agreed to another meeting has been a good signal, but not so long ago it has not been possible.
In the recent past, both leaders have been very negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
It's often written and said that Moscow actively supports Hoftar, and many people believe it.
We were faced with this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on the same day on board a Russian aircraft carrier called the admiral of the Kuznets.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurat, they didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our challenge is to show that we do not support only the Haftard; we are engaged in a dialogue with all the key players in the Libyan conflict.
You and Haftar spoke.
Does understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level make it easier for him to study twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
Russian if he knows, it's very relative.
But the fact that he has learned from us certainly makes it easier to talk to him.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or even in the Soviet Union.
And now they speak Russian very well.
And they're reaching out to Russia, and they're kind of nostalgic about it.
Do you consider it likely that the arms embargo against Libya will be lifted as soon as possible?
Are your Libyan contacts interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
Of course, but, as I said, we don't take sides in this conflict and we don't want to arm some at the expense of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyans for Russia to somehow help lift it.
The process of constitution-making is now under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromises and achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections will take place, as was the case at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If elections take place and legitimate power is finally elected (and none of the parties now has that status), we can ask the UN to lift the arms embargo.
To raise this issue now is pointless and dangerous; it will only lead to an exacerbation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees coming from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow, in this situation, help Italian partners by using its ties to the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is it that the Haftard forces will take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers moving immigrants to Europe?
That's a very timely question.
We're actively working on it.
The Italians need Russian support because Moscow is engaged in a dialogue at the same time with Haftar and Saraj and Misurat and the south.
And the tribes in southern Libya play a major role in this matter, and they are ready to work with Russia.
Is it a question of southerners stopping migratory flows on distant fronts?
So, by the way, the buses that Nigerian immigrants are driving back?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help bring the South together in the negotiation process between Sarajé, Haftar and the tribes of the South.
But first, we would like to see a common opinion on the matter between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered to be an Islamist, supporter of the establishment of sharia in the country.
How radical is he?
Would that not be an obstacle to establishing relations with Russia or the West?
I'll tell you my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are part of his alliance.
Yes, but it is his own position that Libya must be a perfectly normal country -- a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he's also active in the fight against terror.
Where did he get that reputation from?
It has been created by those countries that do not want Russia to communicate with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, and there's the legislative, the executive and the judicial branches.
There's a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
And we mixed all the cards with them and started to interact actively with both Tripoli and Tobrook.
And we're already reaping the results of this work: Rosneft has entered into a cooperation agreement with the Libyan State Oil Company, NOC.
The director of NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosnefti's head, Igor Sechin, made a deal, came directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first Libyan oil shipping to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I suppose we should re-sell.
And what other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
Plans to re-sign the contract concluded at Muammar Gaddafi.
These include previous transport arrangements (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
So this is the oil-for-service scheme, as in the case of Iran?
I don't know what the scheme will be, and I don't really do that.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main economy.
We're actually doing peace-keeping there.
For us, it is important to stop the bloodbath, to help the Libyans to agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya is no longer a propitious environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, that is the main challenge: to help the Libyan people and to get the terrorists out of there.
Do you have any information about the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical Russian or other former USSR elements?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that no Russian or other former USSR member was there to date.
He said he had about 50,000 phone records of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Oz") and no Russian speech there.
And from what States then are these combatants?
I don't want to go into that detail.
Then we'll put the question differently.
How many of the Islamic elements in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans among them, not more than 5 per cent.
The rest are aliens.
Can Moscow hold internal talks like Paris?
That's the plan.
We are engaged in intensive talks with the Libyans, several Libyan delegations have already visited Moscow and have indicated their readiness to visit Moscow or Grozny again.
And when can such a negotiation take place?
It's hard to say right now.
Several visits are also due, and it is hoped that the time and place of the talks will be clear.
At the Czech Museum, the charities collected money for a expensive gift to the sick boy.
In the Moscow Museum of the Melicovo, a nine-year-old boy, who has a DCP, a brain hydrophilia and a complete blindness, will receive a special runway on August 5th.
Sashe, Minister of Culture of Moscow, Oksana Kosareva, and the Director of the Museum, Constantine Bobkov, gave a useful presentation.
The money for the training was collected during a charity marathon called "Don't be tired of doing good" which was held in Melechov on July 15, on Chekov's Day of Remembrance.
On the day before the museum's marathon, a letter was received from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushino of the Czech district, saying, "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a runner to get my feet strong, and I'd learn to walk a little."
And then Saschin's dream came true!
After the performance in the Museum of Pontology, the concert postscriptum will be held, a famous pianist, well-deserved Russian artist Alexander Gindin will perform a purple of popular classical works.
During the Melechov Charitable Marathon, a chorus of the Oriental David Desert, the callers of Ilya Drosdichin's workshop, students of the Moscow Conservatory of the P. I. Chaikowski Academy and the Russian Academy of Gnesin, and artists of the Melchovski Theatre of the "Chechovo studio".
An auction was held for visitors, a book fair and a charitable sale of souvenirs with a marathon logo were organized.
The Melikhovo Museum took the initiative to make Chekov's Day of Remembrance a single day of charity in all the Museums of Moscow on 15 July.
A 30-year-old Olevski of Gitomire oblast near the local soccer stadium shot several times at the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was aroused by the noise and was informed by FACTAM in the communications department of the Gitomir State police.
The man then entered a cafe nearby.
He had a conflict in the building during which a man had used rubber bullets to shoot him, wounding one of the visitors.
A 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care, and there was no threat to his life.
The police and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the shooter had escaped by then.
The guards found him and arrested him on the same day, August 2.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a rubber bullet-shooting device that was sent to the lab.
For this reason, criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 296 of the Criminal Code.
The prisoner would be sentenced to 3 to 7 years' imprisonment.
In Kiev, there was a shooting attack in Lukianovka near the street of Tatar on the night of 28 July.
Michel Carter's conviction for reporting that led to Conrad Roy's suicide
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment for having caused the suicide of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, by means of text messages and telephone calls.
Michael Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months in prison and five more years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the Thursday's hearing, "My family died of grief.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy had mental problems.
Carter, wearing red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, holding her hands together and lowering her eyes.
"With her actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor declared to the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She did not accept responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any repentance."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case of which she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monice said that in his opinion, her "age, maturity or even mental illness did not affect her behaviour in a noticeable way."
The prosecutor read out a statement from Roy Lynn Roy's mother saying, "It's never been a day that I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I manage -- I'm trying to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Roy's sister, Camdin Roy, said that she was incessantly haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"Leave the man who has always been with me since I was born is the pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to be a legal case, since there is no law in Massachusetts that provides for the responsibility for counseling a person to commit suicide.
In 2014 when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon poisoning, he was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been prompted to commit suicide by a message from Carter.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before he died while he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the engine, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monice said that Carter wanted attention by means of Roy's death and prevented her from communicating with the press in order to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of the lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few people who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder of her British apartment neighbour in Italy and acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published in The Los Angeles Times her separate opinion, which stated, "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Yevgeny richev: "I let Langford go like a high-flying bird."
One of the best basketball players in the U.S. Single League, a 33-year-old Keith Langford, left UNIX.
The U.S. lawyer's departure for "The News" has been remarked by the President of UNICS, Yevgenius Bohchev.
Keith made this decision on family matters,' said Evgeny richchev.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Casanus.
Keith wants to be closer to the house.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played UNIX for three seasons, and in each match he scored high, 100%.
So I let him go, like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and his career as a player.
Keith Langford won the club for three years, winning the Single League's silver on 15 December 2016.
During the 2016–17 season, he won a prize to the most successful player in the Euroliga season.
He averaged 21.75 points per match.
This result is the second since 2004 when the prize was established.
Langford, who also won the 2014 prize, became the second player in the history of the European League to win the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with the Chinese Chechen, inform Eurohoops.
An American is expected to enter into a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second-largest European player in July to join the Chinese championship.
Previously on the Chinese CBA, Jannis Burusis crossed the ex-centre of the Panatinoicos.
A sun-burned tourist from Pod Moscow was evacuated by a helicopter in Adigei
Today, Adieh rescuers were evacuating a Moscow tourist from the mountainous region of the Republic, who suffered severe sunburn.
The man was resting at the Fish shelter, located at an altitude of 1,600 metres.
A 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescue team was contacted by the head of the tour team, who said that the man had been burned on a field trip.
Audi has to be modified to 850,000 jets
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW announced that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 cars.
The president of BMW said that the company believed that there were “more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, with reference to European cities, including Munich, where BMW was located, which were considering the possibility of preventing or restricting the use of a diet.
Daimler announced on Thursday that it was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their exhaust.
None of the companies called their step a renunciation.
European automakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States in order to support the implementation of CO2 emission regulations.
But nitrous oxides that eject dietary engines are considered as carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for auto-producers of equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gas of diesel cars is also rising, and maintaining the competitive price of cars is becoming difficult.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, the government of chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of persuading powerful car-makers and ignoring signs of a problem.
The companies try not to repeat the Folxwagen mistake, which concealed the use of so-called “failure devices” which, during testing, were able to correct the amount of dangerous gas emitted to comply with the rules and were shut down under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several leaders of the Volkswagen have been convicted, while the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month a former head of the Thermodynamics was arrested in Germany as part of the Audi engine development team.
Former manager, Zackeo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian, and therefore not protected from rendition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi had fallen under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities had accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission rules and had expanded the investigation which had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may create serious problems for the Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is the source of a relatively large share of the Folxwagen income.
In Astrakhan, a coffee shop visitor paid for false money
The police received a report from an employee of the branch office of the bank that a suspicious five thousand roubles worth of money had been found in the recalculation of the money received from the general service.
A study carried out at the Forensic Centre showed that it was false.
According to the U.M.I.D. of Russia in the district of Astrakhan, one of the visitors to the coffee shop paid a bill to buy a shawrma.
It is worth noting that the cashier was not equipped with an authentication device.
At present, police officers identify persons involved in the production and marketing of a known forged Russian Federation CB ticket.
Such offences are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years, with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages the people of the Astrakhan Region to be attentive to their financial transactions; it recommends that traders install instruments to verify the authenticity of the money received.
The astronomers have found a hellish planet on which even iron can melt
After first examining the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysics were quite surprised at its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Scientists have noticed that water molecules are so warmed up by the light of a star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature makes the water in the planet's atmosphere glow infrared.
WASP-121b refers to so-called "hot Jupiters" -- gas giants, in size and mass, compatible with the largest planet in the solar system, but situated tens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the exoplanet has only 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas shell is hot to almost 2500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens a lavender in Provants.
It has become a symbol of the Provence and South France, but now there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has become worse because of dry weather and insect diseases; this has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the Providence-based CRIEPPAM farm research institute, said, "The LAvanda in Provence is indeed at risk because in recent years the plant has experienced the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially in the fall, the rains have decreased considerably.
It affects the lifespan of a lavender.
And there are little cicadas jumping over leaves of insects that carry micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, they get a lot of them."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavendel not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very much needed in perfume and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, "Besides very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened, or missing.
So we have less oil-containing parts."
The solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as plant spraying with a combination of clay and water and the production of more sustainable drylands.
The Winter University's 2019 Messenger met with the red-haired students
A two-time world ice-hockey champion, the 2019 Winter University, Alexander Semin met the previous day with beginners and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting was held at the 2019 Winter University in the framework of the theme week of the chaiboy hockey week.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on a site with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games were organized with the entertainment of student games and aerobics.
Fifty students attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much sports as possible and stressed that the most important thing at the start of their studies was to work hard and to have a huge desire to go to the field.
"Good thing there's a place in Krasnoyarsk like the Winter Universities 2019, where beginners can ask questions directly to team coaches," said the champion.
Let's note that messages from the Winter University of 2019 help to raise awareness of student sports and healthy lives among red-collars.
The university will work for the entire summer season until September 25th, reports the Directory of the Winter University 2019.
In the State Department, Medvedev's comments
The official representative of the US State Department, Heather Nauert, commenting at the briefing on the remarks made by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of the Russian Federation, said that there was a need to find a "field of interaction" with Russia.
Such areas, she said, should be found to “improve the two-way interaction”.
As an example of such successful cooperation, Nauert referred to the Syrian A truce Agreement.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the briefcase.
However, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev's claim of a complete trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said so, it certainly has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more about it," said the representative of the State Department.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump had signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, the Head of Government of the Russian Federation, Medvedev, said that Washington had declared Moscow a complete trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that US sanctions would work for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes that Trump's U.S. establishment has been "purely beaten."
The missing Bodibilder in Moscow was found on another man's daemon, lost in memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25, under very timid circumstances: he left the car's cabin to go to the bathroom.
Seven days later, he was searched unsuccessfully by acquaintances and locals.
And there was Chamil at a stranger's house in Ramenski.
He was found completely naked by the owner in his toilet.
The Dutch sportsman could not explain how he got here or what had happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
I.D. was helped by the reported missing person.
Incoming doctors have detected some memory loss and brain damage in Hanmetov, reports the Massh public.
There are probably other surprises waiting for the sportsman.
The intruders who kidnapped Chamil were probably already in his apartment, whose keys were also stolen from him.
July oil revenue exceeded forecast by 4.4 billion roubles
The actual oil and gas revenue from July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 4.4 billion roubles, reports the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, the agency explained, was due mainly to a higher exchange rate of the United States dollar per ruble than the monthly average of June used for the estimate, as well as to an excess of actual gas production and projected levels of oil export.
"The deviation of the federal oil and gas revenue from the monthly evaluation in accordance with the Federal Budget Act for the years 2017-2019 is projected to be +40.2 billion roubles in August 2017," said the Ministry of Finance.
Thus, the total amount spent on the purchase of foreign exchange on the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion roubles.
Therefore, the daily volume of foreign exchange purchases will be equivalent to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign currency purchases by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Every working day during the specified period the CB will enter into foreign exchange purchase transactions on organized tenders of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the course of a commercial day.
The acquired foreign currency will be deposited in the accounts of the Central Bank of the Federal treasury.
The murder of a journalist points out that Mexico is becoming more dangerous.
The weekly newspaper Riodos usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss plans to highlight recent violent crimes in Sinaloa State related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war on drugs.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them to the office where they had already thrown a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board in the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked journalists to give names for each column -- evidence is unnecessary, suspicions and internal feelings will suffice.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or by cartels, and a whole list of subversives who make it dangerous to report the chaos in Mexico.
The violence has caused no rest, and there are more and more journalists in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspirator, co-founder of the Riodos, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Waldes in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, although his presence everywhere, a large picture of Valdés showing his middle finger, is marked "Justice" on the front of the Riodos building; two reporters over 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smile, face wearing glasses or his special panama.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common injuries, nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Although in 2010 an office of a special federal prosecutor had been set up to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases had been investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As in the case of most of the thousands of murders committed every year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists' murderers are seldom brought to justice.
The Riodos press insists that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they have been killed with grief, although the environment is much more dangerous.
Without information about murderers, without justice from talking about security at meetings, there's little use,' says Ibarra.
"Very foolish to waste time at this workshop," he says.
"Unless we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Waldes left the office of Riodos in Kuliacan State.
He was only able to drive a couple of blocks before his Red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "the 12th River."
The shooter drove off in his car and smashed it nearby.
Waldes was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two grown children left.
Rumours usually spread quickly over Kuliacán.
But most people don't talk about Waldes.
Since Guzman was arrested and handed over to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival groups are struggling to fill the resulting vacuum.
Let's not say that one or more people are killed every day in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated double-deck drug kings, who are larger than the houses of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that calm is just when one of the cartels takes control of a maritime state with important ports and drug routes in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Waldes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was devastated by the guilt that he failed to protect his friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival kartel factions, who is fighting with Guzman's sons.
The publication might have angered the sons; people suspected of being members of a gang bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second error was that he had not forced Waldes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper had been seized, which had written about the same story.
Waldes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was considered another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, and his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroste and in 2003 he founded the Riodos with five colleagues, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the subject of drugs," said Bohorkes.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for being bold and honest in publishing, selling, and advertising.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that they could read about things that no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its foundation, the Riodos won the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Prize for Reporter's Work in Latin America.
That same year, Waldes won the International Press Freedom Prize for boldness in the investigation of Mexico's drug trade, wherever it went.
He openly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ Prize.
Sinaloa's drug trade is "this is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Romano TV.
"You must accept the tasks which lay on you as a journalist, either so or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The officers of Riodos miss Valdés, a joker who fought like a port porter, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to fight alive.
They relied on their order.
He was always supposed to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, a bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Has love lost him to one order?
His death led them to question their calculations of how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like you knowing about their wives, their children, their legal business, and their underground airports for drug transport.
"These things were beyond the bounds," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-sustainability.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from something that smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of the Riodos, Andres Villareal, is that "failure can be deceived...and then what happens to Javier."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer work in Sinaloa -- as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smugglers, weak government institutions, and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the Riodos had gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to bring cellular phones; a few days earlier it had become known that spy programs sold exclusively to governments were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
Outside, two police officers are sheltered in the shadow of a tree from a temperature of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the state government to guard the office of Riodos, which is located in a four-story building in the Kuliacan bourgeois district.
Some journalists wondered if those police officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers whom the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that was de facto controlled by drug gangs.
In the nearest issue of Riodos, it counted on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of a former boxing champion's brother, Julio Cesar Chávez.
They also had to expose government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of Kuliacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the DA's office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so care had to be taken when the time came to write that everyone in town knew that it was a favorite restaurant for drug dealers and the authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a political party belonging to the ruling Revolutionary-Instance Party (PRI), which had dominated all levels of government for almost the past century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when Guzman's son, El Chapeau, escaped from the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have been searching for a column of Waldes with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"Before we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his skinny bodywork, called El Flaco.
"Today all channels of communication with our sources have been severed."
Valdez's office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the killing of journalists, because employees have become something they never thought to become: activists on behalf of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramírez took several posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdez was killed.
Found the burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on pavements and walls of houses.
Director Bohorkes was in Washington on that day trying to get international support for the Valdez trial.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez Ramírez, she accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then requested that she not be given any more tasks to report on government activities, fearing that anger would compromise her integrity.
Valdez has often said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, its accomplices in government and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Drug journalism," he wrote that reporters are not killed just by drug gangs; they do so on orders from politicians and security agencies in collusion with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 Press Protection Committee considers that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on the orders of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Mary Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
There was a note on her body supposedly written on behalf of the Zetas Cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
Computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to its cut head.
Some publications preferred to close as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold out like El Manyana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels with an article on the first page entitled "What do you want us to do?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile it is difficult to find a job, and they still look out for danger in the streets.
And sometimes they're killed, as evidently happened to a photographer, Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015, along with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after his escape from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance daily between risky decisions.
Ibarra -- who once dreamed of being a poet -- admits he's scared to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, the publishers of Riodos were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when their phones rang simultaneously.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the Masatlan resort left 19 bodies behind, according to confirmed evidence.
The war continued to rage, as promised in a series of letters from the cartels found in the area.
While they were sitting on the pavement, they posted the news on the Riodos website via their cell phone.
The next day, we had to redo the first page.
The sirens were picked up in the vicinity, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes saw if the police guard was ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was placed on the lookout of all of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodos continued his work.
"How can you think about shutting down," said Bohorkes, "if on the very day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her outside to do a report?"
Dinosaurier used a camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, though horrifying.
Researchers reported that the first found remains of an incredible creature of the size of a rhino found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts called it "My Lisa among the Dinosauriers."
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the colour of his scaly skin was redish brown and to say that he had, in a way, a dark past.
A report published in Modern Biology described it as "the best preserved in the history of Tireophorus and one of the best copies of a Dinosaurier in the world."
This is a fossil -- a recently discovered specimen of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the chalk period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly good fortune stunned the researchers, who call it "very remarkable."
This plant-eating tireophorus is the best preserved fossil of this species in the history of the discovery, according to an article in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fake while he was working at the Suncorn Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed different from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tirell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, an animal was found inside the earth's depth of 2500 feet (100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the final result can be shown.
"It's only worth a little squirrel, and you can almost believe that he's asleep," said the lead writer, Kaleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tirell Museum of Paleontology, where the creature is shown.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved Dinosauriers, the Mona Lisa among the Dinosauriers."
Researchers found that it was a herbal, despite the fact that it was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, which seemed to have been seriously threatened by carnivorous Dinosauriers.
This powerful shell-covered Dinosaurier used red-and-white camouflage to hide from the hunters, and used a protective technique known as a protective colour, which is also used by many animals today.
This would make it possible for it to blend into the environment and avoid encountering its enemies, say experts, assuming it was hunted by larger Dinosauriers.
This creature, aged 110 million, belonging to the Nodozaur family, was widely publicized in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tirell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have already studied the animal and have given it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honour of the museum lab of Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent over 7,000 hours digging it.
The surprising preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the shape and shape of the scales and the pancreas on his body.
They found a protective color, a common method of protecting animals in the kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although protection colouring is common, the discovery became surprising, because the size of the Dinosaurier, Borealopelta, is much larger than the size of the present protected animal.
We can assume that this Dinosaurier was hunted so actively by carnivorous Dinosauriers that evolution preferred the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern animals with protective colours – such as reindeer, zebra, or armoured animals – are much smaller and more accessible, indicating that the nodosaurus had to struggle seriously for survival.
"The serious threat from the hunters to a massive, powerful shell-covered Dinosaurier shows how dangerous the treacherous guinea pigs were," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the skin of a Dinosaurier also suggests that its skin should have been red brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, searching for information about his life, including the contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he had eaten during his last meal.
They think that when the Dinosaurier died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he sank and his back went down to the bottom of the ocean.
In those days, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to spread farther into the soil than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is really remarkable in that it is completely covered with the remaining shaved skin, while at the same time it is completely preserved in three dimensions, keeping the original animal shape," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked then, in the early chalk period.
You don't have to use your imagination to recreate it, you just have to take a little squirrel, and you can almost believe that it's asleep."
The small period is an era in which giant teropods, carnivorous, two-legged Dinosauriers, wandered around the earth.
Though the most remarkable of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than the Borealopelta, one of his formidable ancestors could hunt a thyreophorus.
This includes an acrocantosaurus, a monster with a length of 38 feet (11.5 meters) and a weight of six tons.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in Modern Biology magazine, believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after his death and was mummified in the sea.
The creature was discovered by Sean Fake when he was working at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it's the world's best preserved thyreophorus, along with skin and pancircle, and it's safe, from the face to the femur.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their character was two 20-inch spikes coming from their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herb-eating tireophorus has been hardened by what is now Canada until the spilling river carries it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the Dinosaurier kept his shell exactly to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen have been preserved so well that the remains of the skin still cover the bulwark pancircle plates along the skull of the Dinosaurier.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of security is “several as winning the lottery.”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bulwarks of the animal's skull.
His right foreleg is stretched along the side, with five fingers on it turned up.
I can count the scales on his sole."
Michael Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without ID
Mikhail Saakashvili, formerly head of Georgia and then Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without documents proving his identity and citizenship.
Saakashvili's arrival is reported by the Polish Telewizja Republica, which posted a YouTube video of his performance on its channel.
Saakashvili addressed an event to mark the anniversary of the Warsaw Revolt against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not speak Polish, although he had tried to speak in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician addressed the topic of Georgia's cooperation with Poland as well as Ukraine.
That the Ukrainian Migration Service had revoked his citizenship, an opposing politician had learned from his stay in the United States.
It is not yet known how he was able to make a trans-Atlantic flight without documents.
Earlier, the former governor of Odessa State, Mikhail Saakashvili, had declared that his signature on the application for Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not completed any forms.
The investigation of the Wynzeher and Olkhovik case has been extended until January
The pretrial investigation of the co-owner of the Renov Group of companies, Yevgeny Olkhovik, and the head of the T Plus Energy Holding, Boris Wynzeher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basmann Court is considering the extension of the accused's house arrest.
The UK representative informed the meeting of the decision to extend the pretrial investigation for the last time.
“The particular complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need to seize and evaluate a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations on the territory of several entities of the Russian Federation”, the investigator stated.
He added that suspects regularly bribed the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Wynzeher and Olhovik, as well as Mikhail Slobodin, the former head of the Integrated Energy System, who had led the company Vimpelcom until 5 September, had been handing over bribes to senior officials of the Republic of Komi for setting the highest possible price for heat and electricity, as well as for creating a favourable business environment.
Wynzeher and Olkhovik were arrested, staged in Siktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped the investigation and was announced to a federal inquiry.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question "Which streets?"
On August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the bottom of her heart.
Just a day after her arrival in New York on a tourist trip to St. Louis, she was sitting on a bed rented by Airbnb, looking at a Facebook feed on her phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
After noting that none of her tapes had ever posted this puzzled information, she closed the Facebook site and opened a Twitter.
There were many user posts in her feed with the name @TheePharoh.
A real-time rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an armless black teenager who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's lifeless body, spread out in the street, where it would be located for four hours.
"It's wild," thought Ferrel.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put off her phone, and then later in the evening she went back to the tweets that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of signal tape and of people shouting and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who had a poster saying, "A policeman from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, pulled the trigger of a rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals!"
"It's a non-standard situation," said Ferrel, for her own memories.
"It's not a murder like those we're used to and can be described as typical.
At that moment I felt cold.
I was angry and weeping."
She took a flight back and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson in the next nearly three years was the theme of the new documentary "Which Streets?" which will be released on August 11th.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and perseverance from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was driving to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a wreath under colour, they remembered the conversation which had been held up to this morning countless times, “on the experience of blacks and their situation”.
She remembers saying, "Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because a policeman killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't help taking it," said Ferrel later.
"What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She should know about it, see it and grow up on it.
It must not only be well aware of activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of black people and their position, and what we must do to be free to be free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad service if I had protected her from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop they made was in South Florida, a site located across the street from a police station that had become a sort of tent camp while activists were waiting for reports of officer Darren Wilson's total innocence.
There Ferrel and his daughter joined the local businessman who was cooking lunch packs.
They collected packages and helped hand them out to protesters.
A little bit in Ferrell's mind took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism has changed completely since August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at Missouri-Saint-Louis University, she was the president of the Association of Nurses, National Minorities, and engaged in food justice and health inequality among black communities.
"I had no experience as a organizer.
It came by itself."
A few weeks later, at a evening demonstration, Ferrell met Saba Foleyan, one of her co-directors.
Foleyan said that she and her main cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Ferre, were "just trying to document" the events.
Ferrel came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?"
This scepticism was engulfed by numerous people, often white, who came into the community to benefit from its pain and perseverance.
As Foliane explained in a recent interview, "We have heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson are out of focus, and they wanted to do it differently."
By that time Folyan had joined his co-director, David Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the death penalty.
His participation raised sympathy for the project with Ferrel and with the six locals with whom the Team of the "Which Streets?" project had been in contact for years since the murder of Brown.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we say it ourselves," said Davis.
"It was the most important thing to me how these people will be represented, because it's how I'll be represented myself."
And while the project was not about focusing on Ferrell's experience at all – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the leader-pattern, but about how the community is united,” as Foleyan said, it was the most open member of the film.
As a result, the "Which Streets?" shows unexpected personal aspects of Ferrel's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferell, laughing about the first time she saw a finished product.
"But I realized that when you do this job and humanize black people, there should be some vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's history rediscusses and stresses the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Lives movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of a black teenager named Treyvon Martin in 2012 -- are considered homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership support this whole movement," says Ferrel. "Because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Foleyan accepted this statement, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and many homosexual black women”.
However, she insists that “it is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrel was not chosen as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the one who awakened this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she was at first, because when."
You can feel its power through the screen."
Meanwhile, there are no cameras in Ferguson, but the complex race connections between the community and the police remain.
Ferrel will be on probation for another two and a half years for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the social and political atmosphere of a place called home, just "Bardak."
She's still holding on to the word she learned when she came out on Ferguson Street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We must win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
Two Salvadoran soccer players were disqualified for biting US players
The football team of El Salvador, Henri Romero, and Darwin Serene, received long-term disqualifications for unsportable behaviour.
During a quarter-final match between the North American and Central American soccer confederation and the Caribbean (CONCACAF) the Salvadorans bit American players.
The first was Henri Romero's defender.
The Salvadoran bit the attacker Josie Altidor, then pinched him by the chest.
Then Serene's half defender, when he applied an angle in his square, bit the US defender, Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and serene for six.
The meeting itself ended with an American victory with a score of 2:0, passing Goal.com.
A similarity: The artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the middle of the hall in the Freedman Gallery in New York City, people's faces are hanging out with the ceiling on the wire--white, black and brown, all of something inconspicuously similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were made by the artist, Heather Dewey-Harborg, with swabs from her cheek and hair clippings sent to her by Chelly Manning.
Manning sent clippings from Fort Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called "The Rise of Similarity".
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, informatics, and art, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissenting woman, whom Barack Obama commuted the sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
Using a computer software analysis of DNA from Manning and using it to create 3D portraits of people who might have such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a deep, though difficult to perceive manifesto about not only the plasticity of DNA data, the various ways in which they are interpreted and the ingenious determinism of these interpretations, but also the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but was a teenager who openly considered herself to be a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six breaches of the Spy Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her pictures in prison were not available, so only one photograph of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie, on which Manning, in the shade of a platinum wig, clearly felt uncomfortable, was driving a car; this photograph was associated with it.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed his 2012 project, "Scenes of strangers".
In it the artist created portraits of unknown people using court evidence such as cigarettes and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this trash and creating images of how these people might look.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a pre-show of the new press exhibit.
At the time, she was not allowed to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait of her DNA.
So unusually, the artist and her prison muse became friends in writing and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a comic book, "Depressed Images," illustrated by Sholi Kanungo, who painted a picture of how the president would in the future ease the punishment of Chelsea and be able to attend the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book came out turned out to be a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening right now, when Donald Trump declares war to people who reveal secret information in government, and invents new ways to incite Twitter animosity that he is intended to soften.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the timing of all this, she said, "unevently nothing happens."
In a statement by an artist written on the wall of the gallery, Manning's huge signature at the bottom (with a point over "i" in her name) calls for an end to the "automatic division based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar from pencil C, G, and A.
With 200 letters (or nucleotides, as scientifically exquisitely expressed by an artist), Dewey Harborg was hoping to show how surprisingly similar we are, at any rate, by our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Harborg; her 2007 video work "Fog Memory" is also shown here.
"The DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here."
The last part of the show in the same room is the above-mentioned comic book novel.
In it, the King-Congo Manning appears over the United States Correctional Casor with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they'll win," it says there.
"So don't ever shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says an artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I still have the creeps when I talk about it."
Manning had not yet seen the exhibition personally -- as it was visually pictured in comic books -- but when it came, it would be greeted by masks in the middle of the room, by her own genome simulations gathered as a crowd of protesters.
It's also made deliberately, like everyone at the exhibition up to height (5"2, Manning's height), where the pencil was drawn by genetic hoplop groups.
"I'd rather put them on walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to look like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like a movement that stood behind her release."
A professor at the University of North West and an officer at Oxford University are wanted by the police on murder charges
According to the police, a national raid is taking place on a professor at North West University and an officer at Oxford University who is wanted as a suspect for having been found dead in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the Cook County Court records, warrants were issued on Monday for premeditated murder without the right to be released on bail by 40-year-old Wyndham Latham and 50-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranlo, a 20-year-old, died after being injured multiplely.
In a warning issued by the Chicago police department, the body was found on July 27th.
The police received a call, came to the Grand Plasa complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo has been declared dead at the scene of the crime, and the detectives are now investigating the death by stab wounds, considering her to be a murder, while the police are actively searching for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of North West since 2007.
Alan C. Kabbage, Vice President of the University of Communication, reported in an email application that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to visit the University of North West.
"Now it's a criminal case investigated by authorized persons, and the University of North West is cooperating with the investigation," said Kabbaj.
He works as a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
The University and Somerville College spoke in an e-mail application, saying, "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigation authorities."
The statement also said that his colleagues were shocked and wanted to give up.
The Chicago police liaison officer Anthony Gullelmi said that he strongly advises the suspect to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their location, but our attempts to find them are increasing," Guillemi said.
Guillemi said that local, regional and federal authorities were helping to find suspects.
Guillemi said that the police called the administrator of the Grand Plasa building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene awful.
Guillemi reported that it was not clear whether the incident itself occurred on 27 July.
According to him, the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were connected," said Guillermo.
The Grand Plasa Manual issued an address to the guests, which stated: "The police are currently working on a chronology of the incident, gathering information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian vice-premier Mutko: "We'll meet the requirements of the VADA road map soon."
Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) set for the reopening of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would soon be met.
"A certain stage in the implementation of the requirements has been completed, and RUSADA has been authorized to plan and carry out the tests together with the UKAD (Anti-Doping Authority of the United Kingdom).
The WEADA road map was updated accordingly," said Mutko on Thursday.
The Prime Minister comments on the second part of the Road Map of WADA on the restoration of the Code, which lists the conditions for the reopening of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that might present a challenge to Russia.
"All has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA soon," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list suggests that Russian anti-ping structures should publicly accept the results of the VADA-ordered investigation of Canadian lawyer Richard McLarien, who argued that doping in Russian sports was controlled by the State.
Turning to this issue, Mutko said, "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programs, and we're not going to admit what happened."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smyrnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian newspaper Rsport, Smyrnov acknowledged the problems that had occurred in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain conflicting positions and positions.
No one is going to accept this report,' said Smyrnov.
WADA prevented RUSAD from conducting doping controls in November 2015, after a doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Authority (UCAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, Olivier Niggley, Director-General of WADA, stated that RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to re-establish its work.
Fire extinguished in a 79-story tower in Dubai
A large fire, which occurred in one of the world's highest residential buildings, the Torch Tower, was extinguished, broadcasts the Reuters.
It is reported that firefighters managed to handle all hot spots by 4 p.m. local time (3.00 msk).
The local authorities reported that no one was injured in the incident.
As the fire was extinguished, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The reasons for the incident are not yet known.
It has been reported that there is a 79-story skyscraper in Dubai, The Torch, which is one of the highest buildings in the world.
All the occupants were evacuated on time.
The unimaginable costume of the Buzz shaken the fans: trousers that don't cover the underwear
Olga Bouzova, a candid reality show host of the Europe Plus Live festival, struck the audience with a dance in her underwear.
In front of thousands of fans, a newly introduced duet singer from Nasty Kudry performed the song "We'll be hot."
Both girls came on the stage in a persuasive brace, made in such a way that it turned out to be the underwear of the singers.
Buzova and Kudry were written on their trousers.
Formerly reported as a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery hospital commenting on the changes in the appearance of Buzova.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the decline in relations between the North Atlantic Organization and Russia
Radio 4 reported this on Friday, 4 August, with a reference to foreign media.
He said that it was the Russian authorities who were responsible for the decline in relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO also criticized Russia for its situation with Crimea and for its “destabilisation in eastern Ukraine”.
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia was nevertheless possible, and that any further escalation of the situation would be of no use to any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump declared that US-Russian relations are at a dangerously low level and accused the US Congress of doing so.
The Yekaterinburg metro explores a new way of paying
In October, a trip to the Yekaterinburg subway could be paid with a bank card, said the UAO's head of the I-Net, Pavel Vedernikov, in an interview with the State Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same subway fare system as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower Novosibirsk and Lower Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the uniform, to be able to use the metropolitan using their bank cards without getting badges or standing in line," he said.
Starts that will help your company avoid becoming another Uber
Aimee Errett wanted to evaluate the level of satisfaction among the employees of her startup in the area of electronic commerce, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, untrue.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"It was never consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs a 75-member company based in San Francisco, "Madison Reed," which deals with electronic hair management.
She therefore requested assistance from third parties.
A new kind of startup in the area of staff is now emerging, helping companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to make rapid inquiries, contact certain teams and population groups, offer anonymous and hotlines to employees and, in some cases, allow informants to pass the top management and direct contact with the directorate.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glint startup in Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she had gained a better understanding of what her employees thought and felt in three years of Glint use.
In addition to prompt interviews and team profiles, the product provides a company's heat map and illustrates which units have more complaints and which managers have a low rating of approval, which allows it to understand why.
The companies are somewhat aware that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they will become the next Uber who was involved in the scandal when a former employee published a blog describing the aggressive environment in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For startups like "Glint," this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
The "Let's Talk About Payment" Internet Portal, dedicated to financial technology, estimates that the global management, management and alignment industry may cost over $118.7 billion by 2020.
The "Converscent" launch from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behaviour, observed a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year, amid the fall in Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among the clients.
Like Glint, "Conversent" allows companies to send customized feedback interviews, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a helpline for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report bad behaviour.
And if the top manager gets involved, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
"The Court of Public Opinion has seized power from the inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company treats employees badly or behaves unethically, even if the inspector does not intervene, the company may face expensive consequences of client boycotts, employee outflows and legal proceedings, reported Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 facilities, used Convercent for over a year to make sure that the employees were aware of the rules and procedures and to suggest a simple way to contact the company's head office.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for a telephone number or a head office email, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
Often this was a frightening and awkward experience, reported James Vitrano, the head of the law department of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to monitor complaints by employees.
Now that the company uses the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay – can be quickly detected and addressed.
"I can get closer to a complete, complete understanding of the situation of the staff," said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Team of the Ruby Tuesday network.
“And we defend our shareholders from the trials of the staff members.”
According to Queensland, companies began to take employee ethics, values and engagement more seriously in 2002 after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed because of ethical abuses as a result of the Dela Enron.
But it was only when social networks became widespread that companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from spreading the virus online.
"Before starting to use technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both "Glint" and "Conversent" offer their software as a service, charging companies regularly for the use of their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that has received approval from venture capitalists who have supported both startups.
In February, "Conversent" received funding of $10 million from companies such as "Sapphire Ventures" and "Tola Capital", bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Besser Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In markets with strong competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages, and interesting projects, these are just the necessary minimum.
The employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are dedicating their time to companies with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work in a company, feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do is producing results, they're trying harder to make such a company a success," says Nina McQueen, Vice President for Global Entitlements and Satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Conversent and Glint are used.
Investment earns income when companies from their wallets are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the dedication and engagement of staff members, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to cultural professionals in the workplace, it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create the impression that change is coming.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or if it doesn't come at all, it can become a disappointment, and the employees lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 offers, you have to be ready to hold 4,000 interviews," said Russell Rut, president of the management firm of Kotter International, who had to see companies making a mistake relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, the employees will wonder, "Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Errett, a company called Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly interviews with employees, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees, dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is learning more about its employees and hopes that in the long run it will be better able to retain its employees in an industry that is known for the high turnover of human resources.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose clients, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, they open a new asphalt on the Krasno-Armee Avenue.
Barnaul took decisive steps to address the cause of the failure of the Asphalt in the Krasno-Armee Prospect.
The place where the holes appeared twice on the newly-failed carriageway (the junction with the youth street) decided to open it.
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramway was caused by the swamping of the ground in an unsustainable network.
According to Ivan Garmat, the vice-chairman of the city's Road, Development, Transport and Communications Committee, a detailed survey will be carried out for detailed survey and removal of the preconditions for collapse.
Depending on the results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is anticipated that a re-installment and betoning of unsustainable communications will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the capital.
The Bruins team has to work longer because the National Athletic Association has cancelled training twice a day.
It's about eleven o'clock, and a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles is being held up to chat on one side of the team's new training fields on the campus.
Some of them pulled their t-shirts off, stripping their backs, shining from the sweat after the tense first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these moments of idleness are a break in the middle of the day.
Players registered for summer classes will, after three hours of training, go back to their dorms to prepare for their final exams, and the next morning they'll be back at Vasserman's soccer center at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, a coach from the Bruins team, Jim More, said, "The next three days, these guys are waiting for a meat Cutter."
The fact that the National Student Athletic Association cancelled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on players, actually extended their working day – at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
So the start of the first three exercises at the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled at 7:15 p.m. to fit into an already heavy player schedule.
A side effect of the lack of two exercises a day has been more days with one training, and Bruins moves the start of the camp almost a week from last year and conducts summer school training for the first time in the six seasons of the Sea in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 training sessions up to and including August 20, before starting official preparations for the first game in the season against the Texas A&M team in September.
Maura said that he supported the change of rules by the National Student Association, despite the fact that he had given the players another point in their calendar.
"For three or four days we give them this huge burden, this is a serious test," said Maura.
"And they just overcame it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think that when we get to Saturday and have more time, it'll be really great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will shut the training down; this is a difficult task, since its fields are directly visible from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Loskin Center, a expensive hotel, which has already been bombed with footballs that have crossed the protection grid outside the gate.
The Breeins players should be occupying the hotel from this weekend, but Maura admits that when rooms are available during the season, a problem may arise.
"We'll have security," said Maura.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not overreacting the danger, suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and video the training.
If you have a video of your training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security in parking number eight.
We'll do what we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the attack in Petersburg are released from hospitals
All the victims of the attack in the St. Petersburg subway in April were released from hospitals.
This was reported to the press office of the vice-governor, Anna Mithanina.
By the end of July, there were three people in the hospital who were passing TV to the Center.
Remember, the explosion in St. Petersburg's metropolitan area took place on April 3th of this year.
A bomb exploded by a suicide bomber named Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people as well as the perpetrator.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer of Abror Asimov, were arrested.
Remember, on the previous day, Rospresnadzor recommended that the metropolitan of Petersburg review the transport security plan, particularly by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook reinforces fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more frequently send suspicious texts to independent experts and show their opinions under original posts on Thursday, as the world's largest social network, which is trying to combat what's called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, to send them to the test and possibly to show the results of the fact-checking under the source post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news that many believed had an impact on the 2016 US Presidential elections.
The issue was also actively debated in Europe after French voters had been misled by false reports before the May Presidential elections, and in Germany before the September elections they had declared their support for a plan to fine social networks unless they quickly removed hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing a new fact-checking algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which messages are challenged by independent checkers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share," wrote Sarah Sue, a Facebook news manager in her blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the "linked articles" function and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a novel comic: One lock in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in a music video called "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a shelter for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy spot in the Bayle Valley in Kent County, he was watching a turbulent history around him, and now he inspired Jamie Rods, a Yorkshire with a fiber hair and a tendency for historical documents, to a novel-comics.
"I think it's so beautiful--to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
The English Castle covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells of families who lived in Scotty; each story is illustrated by one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becca Palmer and Isobel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhoades, based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote "The Tooth of a Dead Man and Other History" -- a collection of British Library documents that suddenly touched him deeply.
"I could have been touched by just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for Jacobites," he said.
"It's his fingerprint."
And letters always smell of smoke, because in those days the lights were lit.
And after 300 years, in the future, you think you're there too.
Ah, I love archives!"
For a person caught up in such passion for old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months ("I've been a bit there") seems too good to be true.
Rhoades spent all day studying the "new" Victorian castle, walking around the archives and looking at numerous treasures of property and ancient things -- for example, the heads of hyenas on walls or bottles of centuries lying in a hole.
He walked through the park and through the ruins of the old castle, talked to the gardeners, the gardeners, and sometimes the artists who were working on the pictures of his book.
Then at night, he "drinked his whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotty Castle has not been well understood because the National Foundation was not fully able to access it until 2006, when Elizabeth Hassy, the last heir, died.
When Rhoades arrived ten years later, the employees were just beginning to deal with the archive, which he described as "what the aristocrats had dropped on the attic for centuries."
The journals, the letters of the British Empire, the cards showing who owned what you think the land dispute is boring, says Rhoades, but this is where two families fought for it.
It happens, guys!"
In some of the history of the collection, the castle becomes a starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in the "Worker", the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Christian Revolution.
"There is evidence of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in a book called "The knightly families of Kent and Sussex," said Rods.
"The Crusade Revolt began in these places, and I thought the riot was a good start.
Maybe they were connected."
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle -- for example, the "People" -- which tells us about the Jesuit clergyman whom the Darryl family had been hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Smuggler," about the 18th-century smuggler, Arthur Darryl, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug).
The Darryls are the favorite family of the Rhoades who lived in Scotty: "The Gentlemen seem to have been a perfect cheater, always falling into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darryl men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women -- I imagine them as a company of handsome guys who know how to take care of the heirs of large fortunes."
After finishing work at the Castle, Rhoades is looking for other opportunities to gain unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphical novel about Elimenmeki, a place where at the beginning of the twentieth century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew up in the woods again.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"I felt like this, damn it, I have to get back to my real life."
Fifteen largest banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, TB, TB24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhosbank, Binbank and FC Open, seven other credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, no less than 80 per cent of the market will be allocated to organizations that have graduated from the ADB.
But this is not just a way out -- all banks that have declared a break with the ADB are engaged in discussions with another social organization that brings together credit institutions -- the Association of Regional Banks of Russia, which is led by a well-known politician, Anatoli Aksakov, the chairman of the State Committee on the Financial Market, which was recognized, by the end of the last session, and the most effective leader of the thinking committee and the deputy in the number of bills prepared.
The beginning of the conflict within ARB was the subject of a debate in the Federation Council, when new bills were being considered by the Inter-Regional Banking Council, including a new classification of banks depending on the size of the capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunyan, President of ARB, said that the Association believed that the bill was being adopted for the benefit of the largest banks, which were thus attempting to limit the capabilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, in Tosunian's view, did not always justify the revocation of licences from some banks, which was, indeed, subject to an objection from the representative of the CB: many of the heads of the requested banks, such as the VMS, were members of the ADB's management bodies.
It seems that this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a highly sensitive manner with the main banking regulator has become a visible reason for the 15 largest banks, having declared their opposition to the ARB policy, to start preparing to join the Russian association, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB work is low and a constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually taking place”.
The contributors will be better
How will this end?
Let us immediately answer the fundamental question that arises in the event of the slightest banking failure or conflict or nearest to it: depositors are not at risk, rather, of improving the security of the banking system.
He leads Russia by Anatoli Aksakov, who is known for his simplicity in all matters concerning the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued at the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the CB is present at the Association's annual events, and all significant law-making efforts of the Regator are carried out through peer evaluation of the “regions”.
In terms of human resources and organization, there are apparently also no major upheavals anticipated.
Undoubtedly, ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and management situation once such powerful and powerful players, with their contributions and lobbying capabilities, are lost.
However, in this older organization, which was established in 1991, the banking community has a great potential to continue to improve banking law and monetary treatment in general.
It is not possible to say that, in the Russian Association, with open arms, they are willing to accept new members on any condition, based on the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("may be too willing"), who, on 21 July, at a press briefing at the parliamentary newspaper centre, said that “literally the next day, the representatives of the Banks who had left the ARB asked me to consider building the potential of our association Russia”.
Their suggestions are to increase the voice of the bankers in the Association's Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is now under way, the proposals of both sides are being examined, and an agenda for an extraordinary association convention is being prepared, which will take place in Sochi in mid-September as part of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll find out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, highlighting that he is not holding up for the chair, called the possible new leader of the updated association "Russia" by George Luntovski, who is leaving the post of vice-chairman of the Central Bank in September, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoli Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crimea, plans to suspend the vacation for one day and to arrive in Moscow at an extraordinary meeting of the Russian Association's Council, which is scheduled to consider the agenda of the extraordinary meeting of Russia.
The entrance of fuel-powered cars to large Russian cities will not be restricted
The deputy head of Mintrans, Nikolai Asaoul, said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of fuel-powered cars into large Russian cities would not yet be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we should gradually raise the environmental class.
And that's where the concept goes straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, since when?
It's the same thing as the word phrase -- let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Shall we shut the whole town down?
"In 20 years--I don't know, maybe this is going to happen," quotes the Minister's "Prime."
The newspaper Izvetia had previously reported that by 17 August, Vice-Premier Arcadia Dvorkowic had been requested to study proposals on possible options for controlling electric transport submitted to the Government by the Director of PAO by Sergey Kogogin.
Among the suggestions, according to the newspaper, are the use of UXO cars in large towns and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has announced that a new US immigration plan will be adopted to change the rules for receiving a Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work visa and restrictions on family visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and are supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save tax payers billions of dollars, and will do so by changing the way the US provides green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will give advantage to candidates who possess English, have monetary resources that enable them to maintain themselves and have skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said, according to the US media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should bother us.
Before we thought that the year 2017 could no longer get any worse, a new report was published on technological success in sex robot production.
Yeah.
Sex robots are now at the centre of attention.
The Responsible Worker Foundation (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharky, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users can choose the color of robot eyes, the shape of nipples and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about it, but companies are already sending it to consumers in large numbers, and soon we'll see more of them," said Sharky at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have been evolving from their inflatable companions to robots with silicon skin, warm to feel, and almost human lines that are controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots by choosing everything from the color of the eye and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and colour of the fingernails.
But the fact that many robots have "personality" in comparison to which the Stepford wife would seem very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix Robot allows users to adjust the quality they find attractive in robots, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxy Gold sex robots developed by "True Companion", which are presented with a programmed identity -- for example, "Cold Farrah" seems shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "small" character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that suits yours perfectly," announces the "True Company" excitingly.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She's in a different mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may be in a mood!
The emergence of sex robots is a matter of concern -- not least because they replace real human relationships -- but the most worrying thing is the subjugated image of a woman, an association with rape, which causes the occupation of the Cold (read the resisting) Farah.
On the "True Companion" website, Roxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxy?" said the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and growing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex, subjecting to as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still at the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very inculcating in the meanings of the age in which we live.
And many people are neither stupid nor aggressive until the free market gives them an opportunity to do so.
It's no coincidence that these complex sex robots came about exactly when women's rights around the world were threatened when the White House had a president who bragged about what was happening to women.
The most frightening thing about the TV series called "Service's story" is not graphical images, twisted bodies, and ejected eyes, which is how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Galilee is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem so big.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical resemblance of real women (only with porn star ratios) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to appear human to feel, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's the robots that don't look like real women with their "characters."
They can't break up with or leave their partners.
They don't have a life or a biography -- nothing that might indicate independence or anything else that could erase the illusion of complete addiction.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, the maids.
A native of Los Angeles, Eugene (Powder) Jeter, who has been a member of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which will be launched on August 31.
This was reported in an interview with the BeBasket Portal by the general manager of the blue-yellow Andrey Swans.
We were trying to settle with Jeter, but unfortunately he's not coming for family reasons.
We'll go to the European Basquet without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will enable our young players to develop," he said.
With Jeter's direct participation, Ukraine's team won the sixth highest in Europe Basquet-2013 and first won the World Basketball championship, where the yellow-blue was unable to break the group stage, while the United States national averaged 15.4 points per game, 3 picks and 5 shows.
Jeter has ceased to stand for Ukraine since he left the position of Chief Trainer of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The European Basquet 2016 will take place simultaneously in four countries: Finland, Turkey, Romania and Israel.
The Ukrainian team will play their team games on the promised Earth.
Yevgeny Murzin's caretakers will have five battles in group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3 September), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our men's team held two control battles in which they gave way to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
It seems quite reasonable to pretend to be Mita Romney.
In the Trump era, the commonplace was the fact that political arguments polarizing the American electorate had broken down some families at the micro level.
Between thanksgiving and Christmas, the American newspapers were shouting columns about how to deal with the terrible relatives who vote for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're about to burst.
There's less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, a left-wing poet from Chicago, who had been knifed with Republicans in her family, came to see me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knew, including her Republican brother, with whom she had been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found themselves on the same side.
At dinner it's certainly good; but I can't help thinking that in a broader context it might be rather dangerous.
Trump has breathed power into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his government can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will not be struck by his actions.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense in the context of its standards.
I caught myself missing very much today the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney -- with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like) -- compared to Trump and both seem very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just be in his mind to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park -- the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department -- and the best way to spend three dollars in town unless you need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, glass-fibre images on the central drum -- the grinning clowns and animals, who, in horror look at their backs, are extremely ominous, and the ringing music, strangely, exhilarates.
So many famous things in this city are frustrating: species from skyscrapers are becoming obsolete, silhouettes of buildings are too much to be aroused, and the reality of the city is not going to keep up with its dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried about the day I found out that the Suisse cottage district is not really a Swiss chalet (the "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" is not counted) but a large roundabout in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two, a child of eleven and two women of forty can have a great time.
If I could put the carousel on score, I'd put a five, but fortunately nobody asked me to.
And in the department store this week, I was asked to evaluate my "experience" purchases on a scale of one to five stars before holding a card on the terminal.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same plus option to keep the 15 percent tip score is for ordering at the counter.
As a result, not only does the neutral interaction slow down, but it also has to be personalized in a situation that does not involve it.
The poor saleswoman in the department store smiled confusely while I was tired of my experience in selling her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain.
Pistorius has left prison for the second time since he visited a doctor.
Last year he was transferred to hospital to treat the cartilages on his wrists, which the prison authorities claimed he had received as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of wilful murder after appealing the prosecutor's office for an initial sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steencamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her multiple times through the door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria.
Pistoryus said he thought his friend was a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The prosecutor ' s office had indicated its intention to lodge another protest, this time against the six-year period of Pretoria, which it said was too lenient.
The Office of the Attorney-General stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be heard this year.
Pretoria may be extended by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect for beating a NTV journalist has been selected for a non-removal subscription.
Capital law enforcers chose a restraining measure in the form of a non-exit subscription for a man who attacked a TV journalist at NTV Niquito Roszaev during a live broadcast from Gorski Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irina Wolf.
"In the context of the investigation of a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("The beatings") against a 32-year-old man who struck the face of a TV correspondent in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation of the Name of Gorski, the suspect has been ordered to take a restraining measure in the form of a non-exit and proper behaviour subscription," explained the Wolf.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative report had been drawn up on the suspect for disobedience to the police.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during a live broadcast on VDW day, a drunken man came to the correspondent and hit his face.
As later turned out, the bully had nothing to do with the VDW.
On the contrary, they tried to apprehend Moscow, according to Rhozjaev himself.
Two Bulgarian citizens were arrested in Greece for illegal tentage
According to BTW, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were arrested in Greece for illegal tentage.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people were arrested in Sitonia, who had placed tents in an unoccupied place, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the BTW television channel that Bulgarians were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught while parking in a non-locality.
The tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may order a fine.
The Russian MID accused the US Vice President of the cold-war rhetoric.
The statements made during the European Tour by US Vice President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian MID.
"It is unfortunate to note that Washington is getting deeper and deeper into the primitive ideological strains of the cold war, which are completely detached from reality," states the statement of the Russian foreign government.
This is how the MIDA reacted to the Pens's words about the Russian threat and attempts to force the border to be closed, as he said in Podgorica.
The Russian MFA pointed to the disruptiveness of the choice of “or with the West or with Russia” and the invisibility of the hypothesis of the alleged non-alternative entry of all South-Eastern Europe into the North Atlantic.
Russian diplomatic officers also reminded us that it was the US that had broken international law by using force to prevent Kosova from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“Inviting American colleagues to stop the scoffing of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and willingness to work together in a constructive manner, on mutual consideration of interests,” states the statement of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Fedsher was injured in an emergency accident in Moscow.
The accident occurred in Moscow Stupino, and a paramedics driver was injured as a result of a collision with the emergency carriage.
Today about 8.10 a.m. there was a collision between a Mitsubishi car and an emergency carriage in Stupino, Moscow.
"As a result of the collision, the "emergency" machine turned around," said the TASS in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow.
There are law enforcement officers working at the scene of the accident, and the circumstances are being investigated.
In Odessa County, a woman threw her newly born son away on construction, wrapping her into a plastic bag.
On the evening of 3 August, the division police department received a report from a local resident that he had found a parcel of a baby in an unbuilt private house.
“The police and doctors who quickly took the child to a medical facility drove to the scene of the incident” reported to the Odessa Head of the National Police.
The doctor found that the boy was born a few hours before it was discovered, as indicated by the presence of the navel.
A 36-year-old local woman has been identified as a child in the course of priority operational and investigation activities.
It is also found that a woman has three other young children.
As indicated in the chapter, the family had not previously been placed under special consideration and had not been considered by the security guards.
At present, police officers determine the circumstances and reasons which prompted the woman to do so, after which a process decision will be taken.
The baby is now under medical observation.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old woman in Nikolayev threw her child into a garbage pipe.
Gregory Leps: "I'm fighting, though 55 isn't 30."
One of the most successful artists in Russia, Gregory Leps, will be celebrating his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the event, the singer talked to the news columnist.
I remember the night of your polish.
A special tent in the Lurehouses, by Glory Gainor, sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over Moscow River.
I bet you were pretending to spend your next five-year-old.
Plans come true?
As far as the profession is concerned, it's been a good time.
I've worked hard, I've traveled through the country three times, and I've been doing 120 to 1930 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what I was, say, 20 years ago.
Biological clocks don't fool.
Singing as I sang at my 30s is getting harder.
However, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, and I think I'm going to a different level.
That's where you're recording the new album, the first in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it now.
Actually, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we're sending it to a conference in Los Angeles.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" on a single song written with Timati.
She's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we film it.
And we'll introduce the album in November to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
Chris Coleman, a cool American drummer, put his hand on your new record.
Do you think you wanted to involve him in your tour team?
I think Coleman is one of the world's greatest drummers today.
He came to my studio, he was recording his party.
I offered him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a famous drummer involved in various projects.
But for a long job in Russia, they put forth, to say the least, excessive conditions.
We were talking about payments between Y35,000 and Y45,000 a month.
I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer, Max Baby.
Actually, it's better to feed your own (smiling).
Sometimes I want to pick one of them up, not for anything.
For example, Fedor Dossumov's gitarist is highly quoted at the international level.
It's written by Western music magazines, and it's invited to various Gitarre Festivals.
Steve Wye, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of gitarists came, with another performing technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are cooperating with you, but you can't come to the United States?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
I'm not really doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers working on this matter.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get to America.
I've said many times I'm studying there.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful it is.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that experience, school.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always met.
They wanted to sound as good as possible.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has refused me entry for ten years.
But I'll still apply for a visa every year to the British Embassa to be allowed to go there again and most importantly to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me well.
And you're scheduled to have a concert in Monaco in August, not a registered concert, but a poster, right?
Yeah, Monte Carlo has a nice sports hall, and I've played it once before.
Now we've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the concert tickets have already been sold out.
On the "Randew of Lyme Wykule," which will start on July 20th in Jurmal, will you?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyme is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman who can present herself with a beautiful voice and even a whisper.
After the concerts and the anniversary concerts, as far as I'm concerned, you're the one who wants to turn to Vladimir Vysotski's creativity.
You already have two albums with his songs in your floppy.
When's the third one coming out?
Maybe next year.
But it's going to be quite different.
I want to record about 8090 highsotsky songs in about the same performance as he did.
Just a voice and a gitarre.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician, Timur Vedernikov, will direct me.
I'll try to get Alexander Yakovlewicz Rosenbaum to join the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see what happens.
You and Boris Gretchenski's songs gradually introduced into your repertoire.
Why don't you write down the album of his stuff?
Boris Borisowicz is a fine man and a wonderful musician.
I ran into him several times, and I asked him, "Can I sing a song of his?
He said, "Grigory, I write songs to be played."
Please try, sing.
I think it's interesting to write that album.
So far, I don't have a job like this, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisowicz doesn't mind, I'll probably do that.
If you don't focus entirely on your own production center.
I suppose before you realized his potential, you didn't sign a contract with all the artists you care about?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're independent people.
You mean Sergei Lazarus?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, and I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there's Alexander Panayotov, who I led in "The Voice."
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be truly a pity if he did not reach the heights worthy of it.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm filming videos.
I hope it's a good result.
I'm also trying to encourage other artists in my center: buying them songs, crying to poets, and sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they don't reach high altitudes, I'll still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On their way out they'll get a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want to, they can go their own way, and I won't insist that they return their money.
Though I'd like one of them to make a commercial success and pay me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, nobody's going to have to shut down.
Let everyone work, run through, prove, as I once proved.
If you're offered a tour of Ukraine tomorrow and you're guaranteed entry, will you?
I'm still being invited.
These are mostly closed events.
And as for the big tour...
I was a man of my country, a Russian, convincedly flying to Syria on the plane that crashed.
If they say tomorrow they need to fly somewhere else in the interests of the state, I will.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
It is my deepest regret that we have this situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we're the same people and we should be together.
I'm sorry this isn't going to work, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40 to 50 concerts in Ukraine in a year.
We met like nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorak, Light Loboda, Artem Loick...
There are a lot of talented people in Ukraine, and it is truly a pity that they are not now able to fully release their talents to a broad Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would love to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, like Slavo Wacarchuk, and I made a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at this point...
Andrey Opsovov was moved from the cosmodrome
The Technical Director of the East Andrey Opacov Space Centre began work at the State Space Science and Production Centre (SSCCE) of the name Chrunichiv.
He had previously been engaged in the de facto construction of the East Space Station, but due to differences with the management of the Centre for the Maintenance of Ground-based and Space-based Infrastructure (CENCI), he had been transferred to a company in Moscow, where production would be coordinated.
Mr. Opskov will not have a changer: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished and the function will be dispersed into the units of the Centre.
That the Technical Director of the Eastern and the Assistant Director of the Centre for Technology Development, Andrey Opackov, had moved to work at the Chrunichiv GNCP, the "OJ" was presented by the top managers of several space industry companies and by an employee of the government.
"He's been working on a new post for weeks," they explained to people in the industry.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from the Centre on Thursday and Mr. Opskov himself was not available for comment.
However, the "OS" information has been officially confirmed by the GCPCP.
He decided to take over the position of director of production, he said at the plant. "Andrey Opsov has fully completed his task of providing a minimum launch for the first launch on the East Space Station.
Mr. Opskov moved to work at the Centre in 2013 with his duties in space forces, particularly in Biconur, and in Plesetsk, on the "north" launch site, served as the first deputy colonel commander.
In 2009, he became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of being bribed: allegedly, since his presentation, the regional merchants received government orders for their withdrawal, but failed to meet their obligation to clean separate parts of rockets in the archangelic region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its technological development responsibilities in the Centre were extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a spacedrome in the Far East.
The then-head of the Fed, Oleg Ostenko, in an interview with the U.S. said explicitly that the state of affairs in the East "was critical as early as October 2013.
The fact is that a strategic error occurred during the planning process: the completion and first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were scheduled for the same time as the end of 2015.
In order to complete the launch by the end of the year, they had decided to complete the construction six months earlier and had been rescheduled from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, it had to be a trick, since the experts of the Centre had begun to install the technology in a parallel way on uninstalled facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrew Opskov.
Despite the risks and the transport that occurred (instead of December 2015, Soyuz only left on April 28, 2016), this idea was justified, says the source "OK" at the launch site: "We would not have carried out any launches from the East, but would have built."
Vice-Premier Dmitry Rogozine, who runs the launch site, jokedly called Andrew Opskov his "space-susan" but he was the one who almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
Mr. Opstkov reminisced and was straight: for example, in an interview with "Oz" he suggested that the Federal Special Construction Authority (Specstre) be revoked as the only performer in the East and that we work directly with the sub-contractors, "Why should we put all our eggs into a single basket?"
This idea was supported by the government.
Since 2017, the Centre has assumed the responsibilities of a general contractor to complete the construction and construction work at the start-up and technical complex by the scheduled launches in the fourth quarter.
According to OSV, Mr. Opackov's transition to a new job was due to differences with the management of the Centre on how to complete the construction of the spacedrome and on how to work with the sub-contracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be the best for everyone," said one of the top managers involved in building the East.
The government employee, in turn, calls the decision odd: "He was one of the best professionals, finding him an equivalent replacement would be difficult."
This would not be required, according to the "OK" report: the post of the technical director of the launch site will be abolished and its functions will be distributed to the units of the Centre.
There will be a two-professional programme in music schools
In the future, students in children's music schools will be able to acquire two specialties simultaneously.
According to the Vice-Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture of Saintoslav Bluenko, for this purpose it is possible to re-read the subject of repeating disciplines to students, and the question of the payment of the rest of the course in the second profession is to be resolved by means of special subsidies to RIA News.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this matter, and we will, together with the expert community, develop a mechanism that will allow for two specializations, but at the same time will not contradict existing education legislation," said Blueenko.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Poetin's "Children's Talk" with the teachers of the Sirius Children's Centre, a student named Maria Andreyeva reported that she had to pay for a second specialty in the CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she was in violin and piano classes and had prizes for competitions in both directions.
The Head of State had recognized her issue as very relevant and had promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian was arrested climbing the wall on a skyscraper
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian named Cyril N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high building, reports the El Universal Portal.
The incident occurred in the capital city of Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed a three-metre fence into the Nestle office building complex and himself climbed one of its towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or rope.
We've got a young man on the roof already.
The Ministry of Public Security dropped him on the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
There they find out if the young man is lawfully present in the country.
Meanwhile, videos with a young man climbing up the hill became popular on the Internet.
Users called the young man a Spider-Man.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help to lighten the CCTV.
Red meat and chocolate are commonly considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help to reduce symptoms of inflaming intestinal diseases.
It's an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leading to tumbling and excrement, chronic or bloody diarrhea, loss of weight, and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to reduce symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the main amino acid triptophon protein is contributing to the production of immunocells that increase the intestinal acceptability of the intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the intestine cells in the intestine are making sure that dangerous microbes coming with food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering an inflammatory process are balanced with cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severe in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory intestinal diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain microbial in their intestines have increased cell tolerance.
And this is a microbial that needs triptophon -- one of the building elements of the protein -- to trigger the emergence of these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between one species of microbial, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal intestinal microbiomy, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptophon was contained in the mice's diet, the more these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same thing would work for people: a combination of L. reuteri and a rich triptophon diet can contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflaming environment in the intestines.
The postmortem of Dr. Louis Cervantes-Barraganwas, in a study of a variety of increasing immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group, which belonged to the same line but was kept separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by mice microbioms -- communities of germs, viruses and mushrooms that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestine cells has been sequented and six species of microbials present in mice with immune cells but not in mice without them have been detected.
Mouses grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiomy and did not develop this kind of immune cell received L. reuteri, and they had immunocells.
In order to understand how microbials affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then moved small portions of the fluid -- without the microbials -- to uninfected immune cells separated from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of triptophon processing, known as idol-3 milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptophon in mice's food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the triptophon level was halved, the number of cells also doubled.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same more tolerate cell as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastric tract.
It is not known whether by-products of the L. reuteri have contributed to the development of cells in humans, as in mice, but people with inflammable intestinal diseases have found faults in triptophon-related genes.
She says, "Perhaps we need to increase the development of these cells, because these cells affect the inflammatory processes on the inside of the intestines.
High levels of triptophon, if L. reuteri is present, can potentially increase their population."
According to Jose Mourinho, "Monchester United" hired a "genia" in the face of Nemania Matic
"Manchester United" hired a "genia" in the face of Nemania Matich, considered Jose Mourinho after a semi-protector debuted in a match against "Samporia" on Wednesday night.
The player, bought for £40 million from Chelsey, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season match of the UEFA Super Bowl against the Real Madrid on Thursday, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira rushed forward when they wanted to.
However, since Matich did not take part in the Chelsey pre-season tour in Asia, he seriously missed the preparations for the game, and it lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, required further development before the beginning of the premiere season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks -- he thinks football," said Mourinius.
"We'll help him get ready sooner than later."
Like Matich, his fellow new players, Victor Lindeloff and Romelu Luca, began playing at the Victoria Stadium, when Mourinho began forming his core by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but underlined that the club had already achieved fantastic results by employing three of the four players he wished to hire first.
"I'm grateful to the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I'll be even more excited if they get me four out of four, but they've done a great job for me."
Former Lithuanian social-democracy leaders encourage them to remain in the rulership
Former Presidents of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party, ex-Premier Algirdas Butkjavicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Speaker of the Sejm from the social democracy of Cheslovas Yurchenas, have called upon the same party to remain in the rulership.
As reported by the Parliament newspaper, a discussion has been initiated in the social-democracy party about whether to remain in the ruling coalition due to the friction with the Union of peasants and Greeners.
And so the three senior experienced comrades wrote to the same party with an open letter, saying, inter alia, "I understand the disappointment of the party's companions with the results of the elections, but the "ravages" alliance has created conditions for us, though not very light, to continue to pursue the goals of social justice which we have set out in the Government's programme and to maintain the political dominant position of the left centre over the right parties."
In the view of former party leaders, the discussion so far “had a emotionally based expression of opinion without specific arguments”.
The authors of the letter fear that their party's reckless actions may lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
The disabled Anton Majev was fined
Mosgorsud commuted the sentence of the disabled chariot Anton Mamatev from four and a half years' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
The convicted person had previously been released from the SIZO by a decision of the Timirozev Court.
In doing so, Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he had arranged for the robbery and kidnapping of a scooter from a former SWAT fighter.
Mosgorsud reduced his sentence to 200,000 roubles.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms a crime, and therefore must be held criminally liable," explained the "Oz" press secretary of Mosgorsud Uljan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account the state of health of the mother, the facts of the case and the absence of the circumstances.
The court also applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which a sentence may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to the assistant of Mamiev, Vasily Serostanonov, the court did not establish the circumstances which would justify a change in the category of gravity of the sentence and a change of sentence.
Anton Mamiev himself stated that he was dissatisfied with the Mosgorsu decision.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be to justify, intend to continue fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not rule out the appeal to the Mosgorski Court of Cassation and the Supreme Court.
"We'll use all the leverage up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "RlA News."
Remember, 28-year-old Moscow Anton Mamiev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a criminal figure in the fall of last year.
The disabled person claims to have bought a scooter from acquaintances for 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, the proprietors of the motoraller, including a former SWAT combatant, said that the disabled and his assistant, Vasily Serostanov, had taken their property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Serostanov to three years' imprisonment, while Anton Mamiev was sentenced to four and a half years' imprisonment in a general-regime colony (art. 162, para. 2 of the Criminal Code).
After the motionless disabled person had been placed in the SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the Human Rights Commissioner of President Tatiana Moscalkov, had joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamiev was released from the SIZO by a decision of the same Tymirazev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsu.
UNF will prepare a report to the President on the environment
The outcome of the Action Forum of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, report to the "News" source in the UNF and confirm the leader of the Alexei Anizim movement.
He said that the Froontics Forum planned to prepare a report to the President on domestic environmental issues and to propose a strategy to address them.
The UNF News interviewers note that the report to the Head of State will contain a “deep analyst” on the situation in all the federal districts of the country.
According to the News, the FNL's final forum will take place in the fall.
The exact date has not yet been set, usually according to the President ' s schedule, who is the leader of the movement and has a traditional presence at key FNL events.
The Front held several cross-regional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts in Rostov-on-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be in the capital of the Republic of Buriya Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the suggestions that have been made and will be presented at these events, we will form systemic proposals to address environmental issues, and we have told the “News” of the interviewee in the FNL.
The Co-chair of the Central Chief of the Olga-Temotheev Movement, who chairs the State Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the “frontics” would report to the Head of State on the work carried out during the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final Ecological Forum and the EfE Action Forum are likely to be combined.
In the course of the year, we grew up with a strong team of experts in the field of environmental issues, saw gaps in the law, and stopped dozens of abuses.
All this will be part of the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the Frontics report on the work on priority projects of the FNL, she told the News of Olga Timofeyev.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would be invited to attend.
He had previously participated in the UNF Mediaforum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will be history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to start environmental mechanisms to work for years.
To keep these matters on the agenda, she added:
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), Andrey Kolyadin, said that, in raising environmental issues, the UNF was acting in line with the Presidential agenda.
Many things they offered as experts in various fora, and these were supported by the President, said to the news by Andrey Kolyadin.
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded, which could give the regions additional impetus for development.
Subsequently, with the help of the FNL, the regions will be able not only to solve their environmental problems, but also to develop ecotourism, added the expert.
The relevance of environmental themes was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Poetin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the waste dump in Balašiy (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nevodka (a bill had already been drawn up to ban the open trans-shipment of coal in localities, one of the authors being Olga Timofeyev).
Ecological experts believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created; the question is the further application of the law, as well as the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions made by the State, considered by Leonid Bochin, head of the Environment for All Charities Foundation.
Sergei Tshiplenkov, a member of the HRW and head of the non-governmental organization Greenpris Russia, in a conversation with the Newspapers, stressed that successful solutions to environmental problems required a responsible approach by society and business, with few legal efforts.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more lucrative step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change, said Sergei Chickenkov.
The expert stressed that there was a need to reverse the tendency that environmental law abuses were an economic solution for business.
The British inventor used a micro chip to get into the house and the car at the swing of his hand.
The British inventor was the first person in the country to be fitted with a micro chip to open the door of his house, to go into the office and even to start the car with a simple swing of his hand.
Stephen Northham, a 33-year-old, had put a tiny chip between his thumb and his index finger and now, through his firm BioTek, offered this service to companies and individuals who wanted to simplify their lives with technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from King's in Winchester, to make sure that the infusion procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
Technology looks like a micro chip that puts cats and dogs in, and it only takes 30 seconds.
Nortem's company also replaces locks in houses and cars with a chip compatible with 300 pounds per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The bill for the White House cost tax payers thousands of dollars.
According to military records provided by the magazine TIME, the White House's decision last month to bring a Marine Helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost the tax payers $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One" when the president is on board, became a central part of the 17 July White House event at which American construction programs were shown.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials examined the technology products from all 50 states.
A helicopter made in Connecticut was placed next to a boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a trucker from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the division responsible for managing the Helicopter, the White House Military Authority ordered the presence of the Helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO", only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to make sure you knew because this is an unusually well-publicized event," wrote HMX-1 in an e-mail to its supervisor, the first deputy airmaster of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and remain there until the lawn is released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return in accordance with the working hours.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the course of the event, while the guard of the unit remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear whether a second crew was required as a result of the log "TIME".
The Hatch Act forbids federal employees from using State property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 specified whether the activity was in conflict with that order.
"We asked, among other things, whether it was a breach of Hatch's law, and we were told no," wrote the commanding officer.
"It seems you have nowhere to go," the deputy chief replied.
The "Done in America" event was declared by the White House as an official event and was not subject to Hatch's law.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the reform of the health care that was then being prepared by the Senate and lauded attempts to govern government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine One" and "air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to ask for them only in the interest of photographic capabilities.
Trump was already the subject of discussions in February when the President's plane flew in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was full of complaints about the use of the Presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is excited about the "made in America" show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said Lyndsey Walters, the deputy secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around the Washington Agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the President of the United States to transport to the White House to exactly an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out fifty-eight training landings at the White House.
One of the officials said that the flight carried out for the "Done in America" event was counted as part of the necessary training flights in a month.
The unit's rotary-wing aircraft also flew for 11 additional hours on that day as part of the “non-Presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, tax payers were not paid for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in the organization of a demonstration of a helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not account for the budget for Presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the time-rate of the Department of Defence for the fiscal year 2017, the VH-3D rate is US$24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records indicate that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes each direction from its airstrip at the Quantico Marine Airbase in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“The calculation of the value for the tax payers based on an estimated rate of compensation is quite wrong,” says Walters.
“These approximate rates include staff, services and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual allocation.
According to a study carried out by the RAND corporation in 2015, the rates of compensation do not include the cost of the troops, but do take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, the former White House spokesperson, Sean Spicer, spoke out to defend the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show this week what's done in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have been working so hard on.
Therefore, of course, it is perfectly appropriate to pay attention to this."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with a helicopter by examining the South Lawn during the event, but he was exactly sitting in the driver's car.
Within the White House, Trump addressed the company's representatives, making a joke with the press about his own fleet of products.
"I know very well "Sikorsky," the president said. "I have three."
Moscow will provide subsidies for the emergency services of urban hospitals
Every year, Lifesaving Grants will be provided by the ICUs and ICUs of the capital health clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow's mayor Sergey Sobian visited the Yudin City Medical Hospital.
During his examination of the hospital, he gave a thank you letter to the orthopaedic doctor, Victor Procko, under whom the most difficult operation was carried out to rebuild the teenager's foot.
Sergei Sobian also reported on the decision to grant a grant each year to the ICUs and ICUs of the city clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the capital master, the Jewish hospital is now one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the hospital has received new modern equipment to enable its doctors to perform unique operations.
The hospital was opened in 1961 at the Columen village hospital.
Currently, the health-care units are designed to receive over a thousand patients.
In addition to the ICU and the hospital, there are day-to-day rooms.
The staff of the hospital is 2,800.
The total area of the health centre is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the Medical Institute became a member of a pilot project on the establishment of short-term hospitals (SBCs).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
In surgery, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce patient recovery.
After the hospital operation, they spend only a few hours.
In the first six months of this year alone, 36,000 patients were hospitalized in the Jewish hospital.
The hospital's medical staff performed 15,800 operations with varying degrees of difficulty.
NBU reported that there was no purchaser of Ukrainian Sberbank's daughter.
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no bids to buy the Ukrainian Sberbank's daughter.
This is reported on Friday, 4 August, by the TASS, with a reference to a representative of the NBU press service.
The NBU confirmed that a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and a Cyprus citizen, Victor Prokopeni, had been withdrawn on 3 August 2017 to agree on the indirect purchase (through the Parity Bank) of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares.
"No papers have been received from other potential investors to buy Sberbank shares in the NBU," notes the report.
On August 3, a Belarusian businessman, Victor Prokopenia, withdrew an application for a daughter of Sberbank.
On 28 July, it was reported that the National Bank of Ukraine had refused Russian businessmen Said Guteriev and Gregor Guselnikov to purchase the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
The governor based his decision on the fact that businessmen had not provided the necessary documents to verify that they were in accordance with Ukrainian law.
Sberbank reported selling his Ukrainian "girl" to Norwick Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The major shareholder was Said Guterius, the son of Russian businessman Michael Guteriev.
The sanctions against the five Russian banks in Ukraine, among them the Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
They are not allowed to withdraw capital from the country in favour of parent organizations during the year.
The third season's "Drug" Trailer: the Kali Cartel plays a central role in the popular "Netflix" series after the death of Pablo Escobar.
Despite the fact that in the second season of "The Narco" the identity of the murderer was discovered by Pablo Escobar, the "Netflix" series was far from being completed.
The stream service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons are scheduled, and the third has already been presented by the first caravan to show the villain of the coming show.
In the third season, the agency's attention was attracted by the richest drug-dealer organization, the Kali Cartel.
The organization, led by powerful godfathers, works as a Fortune 500 corporation, only with large amounts of government bribes and violence.
The leader of the Cartels is Helberto Rodriguez Orehuela (Damian Alcasar), Michael Rodriguez Orehuela (Frankrik Denis), her brain, Patio Herrera (Alberto Amman) is responsible for contacts with Mexico, and Chepe Santacrus-Londondoño (Pepe Rapasote) is working in New York.
In a recently released caravan, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Penha, a character who attracts United States and Colombian law enforcement agencies to help in the war against drugs.
Among other new players, Mathias Varela, Michael Stahl David, Matt Willan, Igel Angel Sylvester, Kerry Bichet and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Drug" will be released on September 1.
The democracy in Afghanistan depends on women's role in politics, said the UN.
The elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, have declared on Wednesday the head of the United Nations mission to Afghanistan.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the United Nations assistance mission to Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for elections to the Province Councils, three women are fighting for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Choices can only be fully representative when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the election process.
The provincial council elections and the President's elections will take place in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threatened to disrupt the process of elections, which coincided with the transition of international forces from military operations to the role of counsellors.
In this year's elections, for the first time, power moves peacefully from one democratic government to another.
Hayes said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3,6 million registered voters are women.
The Office of the Public Prosecutor confirmed the Indictment in the case of Nickita the White
The Russian prosecutor ' s office confirmed the criminal conviction against former governor of Kirov oblast Nikita White, accused of receiving a large bribe.
On Thursday, 3 August, it was reported to the agency, and it was sent to RlA News.
The materials have been submitted to the Resense District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Vienna, fines were increased for tourists for improper behaviour
The Venezuelan authorities have increased the fines for swimming in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
Walking around town in a bathing suit or bare body will now be fined 200 euros.
For 100 euros, those who make a public picnic or ride a bicycle over pedestrian areas will be required to pass the TASS with a reference to the Association of Russian Tour Operators.
It is also mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for monuments of 400 euros and garbage of 25 euros.
Tourists will be informed about the need to observe the rules of conduct in Vienna through a special company called Enjoy, Respect the United Kingdom (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) on social media, as well as through advertisements and posters on the city council website, on billboards and in the most crowded tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the Tourist Adviser of Vienna, Paula Mar, fines will be reported to the home country ' s hosts to prevent their compatriots from making such mistakes.
"The problem is that it's seen as a beach," she remarked.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow.
In Vienna, the number of visitors to the city centre is already being restricted successfully.
Instead of the 100,000 people who wanted to observe the Festival del Rentore festival, only 60,000 people were allowed to attend the festival.
In addition, a freeze has been introduced on the establishment of new hotels and restaurants in the historical part of Vienna.
State Border Guard officers arrested 272 illegal persons at the border with EU countries in the first half of 2017; a total of 1,059 illegal immigrants were arrested.
This was reported to the State Security Service.
Of these, 314 persons were arrested for illegal border crossing and the others for breaking the rules of residence of aliens in Ukraine and other offences.
The largest number of illegal immigrants was arrested at the border with Moldova.
On the border with EU countries 272 illegals were apprehended, most of them on the border with Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Romania.
Statistics show that among the illegal immigrants arrested, the majority are citizens of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, India, Armenia, Viet Nam and Viet Nam.
In addition, almost 2,000 potential illegal immigrants had not been allowed into Ukraine.
Remember, the EU has found an extraordinary way to get rid of the immigrants.
Jazz in Skokovo: experiment and improvisation
The programme of the second festival, Skolkovo Jazz Science, was announced and will take place on August 26, at the Skolovo innovation centre.
Guests are expected to make presentations by leading jazz and solitaire groups, academic discussions, interactive sites and other musical and intellectual events.
As the organisers promise, the site will become a site of improvisation and a field of demonstration of new creative opportunities.
"The festival's guests will be able to sink into a world of experimental media technologies and learn how innovation in science becomes a new tool for interaction with art," described the orientation of the Forum's Vice President of the Skokovo Foundation, Helena Zelentsov.
There are many stars among the members of Skolkovo Jazz Science 2017, including the Moscow Jazz Orchestra of Igor Butman, who will present a joint program with the singer Jazz Simonova.
Jazz and science are related concepts, and they're not accidentally combined, but they're explained by the folk artist of the "Illustrations."
The experiment and the improvisation of jazzmen are as much appreciated as scientists.
One of the main events of the festival will be the performance of Azekel, a British national of Nigerian origin, known both as his own creativity and his work with the legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.
The jazz fans are eagerly awaiting the first five-time Grammy prize winner, Christian Sands of the United States, with his trio.
In a new capacity, he will try himself one of the best academic chamber bands of the "Music Viva" under the leadership of Alexander Rudin and with the participation of the pianoist Yuri Favorin.
The merging of jazz, ethnic and electronic music, as well as academic traditions, will show the Marimba Plus ensemble and its leader, composer and performer at Lea Slapner's marimba.
One of the most unusual festival performances promises to be the sequel of the prize winner Sergei Kurehin Anton Muskeliadze.
Artist experimenter manages music and video with gestures -- that's the way the technology works.
There will be eight musical groups on only two scenes of the festival.
In addition, the programme includes open discussions, interactive zones and art objects combined with the idea of merging music and science.
The guests will be able to take part in the experiments, visit the science bench and observe the creation of cryofrozen or bulging sands from the frost and water.
In the special area, vinyl will be able to buy the records of relevant jazz performers and other musical players, and at the book fair, it will provide publications on various subjects, including music, science, and biomedicine.
FS dismissed Lake from head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday endorsed the statement of the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Victor Lakeov, and dismissed him from his post.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk district.
A request to be excused from his position as the lakes wrote last week.
He explained his decision to rotate and his desire to change the rhythm of life.
The Senator also pointed out that the decision to leave was not immediate.
Since 1996 Victor Lakeov has represented the Parliament of the Khabarov Region in the Russian Federation.
The Senator has been in charge of the Defence and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both the inhabitants and the growers of the storm
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (East Siberia) to establish fair electricity prices have begun to bear fruit for many decades.
Since 1 September, the cost of electricity for industrial recipients has decreased by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation, in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation “On the introduction of changes to the Rules on the Optical Electricity and Power Market and to the combined forecast balance of the production and supply of electric energy (power) within the framework of the Russian Unified Energy System for the subjects of the Russian Federation” (No. 842 of 17 July 2017), set the estimated prices of electricity and power to the industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for drilling goods is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly improve the lives of small and medium-sized businesses and individual businesses.
For decades, the leaders of the Republic have crossed the thresholds of Moscow cabinets in vain attempts to equalize the region with the neighbouring Irkut region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants in Angor, which comes from the Baykala, for which Buryatia is the main catchment area.
And it was only this year that the movement began.
In March, electricity prices for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 roubles/kWh to 3.93 roubles/kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of the Buritia by a decision of the Federal Government, a series of industrial consumers has emerged on the list of areas of the bulk market price zones for which the characteristics of the operation of the bulk and retail markets have been determined.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/hour 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to give at least an approximate date for new tariff shifts towards a lowering point for Buritia.
Scooter was not frightened by the Ukrainian prosecutor's office and flew to Crimea
The legend of electronic dance music, Scotter, flew to Crimea without fear of threats from the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
"The flight went well, and tomorrow I'll have a concert," quotes the RlA "News" by HR P Baxter's frontman.
Earlier, the German edition of Bild, referring to Ukraine's deputy prosecutor, Yenin Yenin, had reported that, for coming to Crimea, which was considered to be a temporarily occupied territory in Kiev, musicians could be sentenced to up to eight years' imprisonment.
A performance by Scooter at a festival in Balaclave called #ZBFest is scheduled for August 4.
#ZBFest is being organized by the Golden Balk to celebrate International Champagne Day.
Scooter, one of Germany's most famous groups, was founded in 1993.
Ace's last album was released in 2016.
Besides Scooter, the festival's guests will be Sergei Galanin and his group Serga, as well as Garik Sukachev and Brigada C.
The Moscow subway will be the premiere of the new season of the Game of thrones.
The Russian premiere of the seventh season of "The Games of the thrones" will take place in the metropolitan metropolitan area.
This is written by the "Comsomol Truth" site.
It is known that the first episode will be shown on the night of July 18th at one of the stations in the "Night in the Subway" campaign.
In the hallway under the soundtrack of the show, artists dressed as white walkers will meet.
Anyone who wants to take a picture will also be able to take a copy of the iron throne installed on the platform.
According to the first deputy head of Moscow subway, Roman Latipov, a show under the ground, which will be the first in history, will help audiences to feel better about what's happening on the screen.
The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiled Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in the McVitee's factory in Glasgow
The trade union requires guarantees from the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitee's in connection with its long-term obligation to produce at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has ignored the issue of future investments on the Ukrainian site.
A factory that produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of the McVitie's, reports that over five million pounds have been invested in the facility in the last few years.
The company adds that, in the event of any change in the operation of the site, employees and trade union representatives “are the first to know about them”.
In a letter to the head of the company's facility, the Scottish GMB branch demanded that McVitee's react to the concern that funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
Drew Duffy, a senior organizer, said: "The members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the general manager of the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tolcross."
The families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in the Greater Glasgow; this is the most important pillar of decent work in the area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the growth of the living minimum and the chronic decline in production, the East End Glasgow desperately needs prosperity in the McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, "The head of the Ukrainian facility only yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of the GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with the employees and trade union representatives."
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with GMB staff and representatives, at which we openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to the staff that, like all companies working in the most competitive and unstable economic environment, we are constantly re-evaluating our actions – and that applies to all our facilities and activities – in order to remain competitive.
"In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Ukrainian facility, especially in production lines and improvements in performance."
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and if there is any change in the work at this site, workers and trade union representatives will be the first to know it."
Poetin said that the authorities would not give orders to Rosneft and Gazprom.
Vladimir Poetin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet should be involved in the issue of gas supply to the Eastern Petrochemistry Company (VNFC), but that no one would give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosnefti.
So Russian President Vladimir Poetin responded to Igor Seczyn's request to help resolve the differences.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, Igor Sechin, head of Rosnefti, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East District, said that the lack of a gas agreement with Gazprom for VNHC threatened the duration of the project.
Sechin observed that the dialogue with Gazprom on the matter was ongoing.
Gazprom suggests we find gas resources from the Rosnefti perimeter, but we don't have that kind of resources," he added.
Recall that Rosneft has requested permission to use gas from the Gazprom mine of Kirin, located on the Sahalin shelf, for a “Eastern petrochemistry company”.
In June, Gazprom stated that the talks on the matter were ongoing and that there were no sharp corners.
Did the SCW warn Barcelona about Naimar's transition three years ago?
A member of the La League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
PARI St. Germaine will not stop chasing Naymar after the club has offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but have they warned Barcelona about the world's record three years ago?
The sensational proposal revived the summer transfer window, when League 1 was ready to break the world record at the cost of the transition, more than double the previous score of the return of Paul Pogby to the Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is over, Naymar will become the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's highest-paying professional sportsman, as SWF offers him a wage of over £500,000 a week clean.
It is known that Barcelona is furious as to how the offer was put forward and how Naymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the leadership of the Catalan Club, the club has always done its best for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned of this opportunity three years ago by the President of SVU?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in employing Blaise Mathuidi in 2014, OSSER Al-Khalaifi issued a strong warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best players in the CSW.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll fight them, we'll make suggestions to their players," said Al-Khalaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to enlist one of our players, they'll have consequences."
It seems that Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in Marco Verratti's SVU semi-protector.
SVU has made it clear that it will not release the Italian player under any conditions, and it is now likely that Barcelona has the effect of losing one of its most valuable players, Neumar.
Poetin has asked to settle the payments made to the victims of forest fires.
Russia's President, Vladimir Poetin, has asked to investigate the material assistance being provided to the affected inhabitants of forest fires and the construction of new homes.
Today I would like to hear how the work is going.
In particular, please report on the status of payments made to affected citizens.
I have some confusion.
"In this respect, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues questions about how much money is spent," said Poetin at a meeting with the leaders of the regions based in the Baykali region.
On 4 August, Vladimir Poetin visited the Baykali State Natural Biosphere Reserve.
Poetin was accompanied by an authorized representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Majilo, and by Leonid Mikhaylik, head of the BIKLA branch of the FGBU.
They talked about the work on cleaning the lake.
Then the boys were shown in an open container near the container, which they had prepared for breeding.
At first, Poetin let some boys out of the tub.
Then pulled a special handle on the lid of the container and released the rest.
Also during the trip, the leader ordered to take care of the environmental situation on the island and build a road on Olhon Island.
According to the Minstroy, you need one volume, but you need another volume.
"I want to figure this out, actually, what's going on there with the funding," underlined the Russian leader.
Recall that during the forest fires of 2017, the villages of Buritia, Irkutsk oblast, were hit with fire, and houses and buildings were destroyed.
In Ukraine, an offer was made to send a Russian to prison for illegal border crossing
A bill has been registered in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine which provides that Russians may be subject to criminal penalties for illegal crossing of the Ukrainian border.
As RT broadcasts, a document registered in the Ukrainian Parliament's electronic database suggests a three-year prison sentence for Russian citizens attempting to enter the country illegally.
It is observed that for a repeat offence or an act committed by a group of persons the sentence may be increased to five years.
If the perpetrator had been arrested at the border with a weapon, the time spent in custody would be eight years.
It was previously reported that Ukrainian border guards had apprehended Ukrainians attempting to enter Russia outside the specified crossing points.
Magnite went out in the open.
The second largest food retaliator, Magnet, announced the opening of three testing shops in a new format called Magnet Opt, designed to purchase small-scale products.
At the same time, the company's press release continues to offer the option of buying goods for retail.
The shops in the new format were made in Krasnodar, Saratov and Uljanovsk.
Their range is about 1,500 items of food and non-food items.
"The new service will allow companies and businesses to purchase for financial gain, while the inhabitants will buy supplies for a week or a month," they are sure of Magnet.
The small-scale segment is already run by Metro Cash & Carry and Selgross Cash & Carry.
In 2017, Lenta launched a special program called Lenta Pro: it invited legal entities and private businesses to purchase hypermarkets from special funds, to collect invoices to account for costs and to return VAT.
The project focuses on the HoReCa segment, small differences and offices.
There will be two new areas in Russia that are ahead of economic and social development, Abaz and Novotrowitzk.
The relevant decisions of the Government of the Russian Federation will enter into force today, 4 August.
The borders and economic activities of the TOR have been defined in the city of Abaz in the Republic of Haqazia.
In a town of 15,000 people, there will be a special legal regime for business, as well as a minimum capital investment of the resident population and a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
This is expected to attract about 2.5 billion roubles of investment into the city and will create more than 600 new jobs.
The list of economic activities in which ABASA will have a special legal regime for business, such as crop production, animal husbandry, food production, non-alcoholic beverages and clothing.
Already, the Government of the Republic has signed framework arrangements for the implementation of eight investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the Territory's vulnerability to the OLG Landmine.
In January 2017, the authorities in the region reported that Haqsa had met all the conditions of the Mino-Economy for the creation of the TOR.
The Orenburg State has also done so.
There, the city of Novotrowitz will also create an area of pre-eminent economic and social development.
This will allow the monotown economy to be dissociated, less dependent on the U.S. steel industry, and more than 2,300 jobs and more than 8 million roubles of investment.
The list of economic activities under which the new TOR will have a special legal regime for employers includes, inter alia, fresh fish farming, the production of feeds, drugs and medical materials.
Novotrowitz became the first monotown in Orenburg County to become TOR.
Let us recall that the pre-development area is an economic zone with favourable tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges that is created to attract investment in improving the lives of the population.
The following are among the benefits for the residents: a profit tax of not more than 5 per cent in the first five years and not less than 10 per cent in the next five years; social contributions of 7.6 per cent in the next 10 years; the use of the free-customs regime; the favourable treatment of connections to various infrastructure facilities; and favourable rents.
The vine called Manson "screw" and threatened to "screw."
Yuri Loza expressed his outrage at the American rock musician Marylin Manson, who insulted Moscow.
In an interview with Comsomole Truth, a Russian singer called Manson "disgusting" and "rebellious."
According to Loza, foreign artists who make such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
Besides, Moose thinks that Manson needs to be punched in the face for what he says.
Remember, the American artist, famous for his estranged actions, spoke rudely about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, the "Arguments of the Week" wrote that Manson's statement was commenting on by the national productioner Joseph Prigozin.
