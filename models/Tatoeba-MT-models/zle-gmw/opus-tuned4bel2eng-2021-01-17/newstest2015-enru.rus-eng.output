The Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
The new Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, meets with his Japanese colleague, Sindzo Abe, in Tokyo, to discuss economic and security ties, as part of his first serious foreign visit after the May elections.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the third largest economy in the world.
Plans to expand nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
India also appears to be looking forward to an agreement on defence cooperation between the two States.
The Russian FANO will hold the closing Expert Session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) will co-host the third Expert Session on the Evaluation of the Performance of Scientific Organizations.
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings organized by the agency during the year and will be reported in a press release submitted to the Lenta.Roo edition.
At the third meeting, it is planned to take stock of the work of the Expert Session during the year and to develop a final list of indicators to measure the performance of scientific organizations.
Separate participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting the evaluation.
The third expert session will be a concluding event in a series of events to develop a common approach for all three academies to the evaluation of the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have been able to do so, and the final version of the regulations is being agreed upon.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis and agree on the stages and dates of the evaluation,” said the head of the Russian FANO Expertise Authority, Helena Axenov.
More than a hundred Russian scientific institutions will attend the event.
It is expected that a resolution will be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at the city of Moscow, Soljanka Street, house 14.
Scientists found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysics from the University of California in St. Croix examined turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of experts will make it possible to search for relatives among the stars, i.e. those from the same cluster.
The authors published the results of their studies in Nature magazine and are available briefly on the University's website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearest stars is the turbulent mixing in clouds of gas before the formation of the stars.
Even if a born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the location of its birth and the region of its birth.
Scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of a star outside the cluster might result in differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
Simulation results from astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, experts using a supercomputer modelled two streams of interstellar gas that together formed a cloud.
This object, for a few million years under its own gravity, has been transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added tags to the initial gas streams and found that rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud achieved a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
Astrophysics believe that their research proves that we can look for chemically related stars and identify possible regions of the formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrested a 20-year-old after chasing a bike at high speed.
The motorcycle was confiscated after passing at 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and across a bushland to escape the Pilbar police.
A transport policeman in Carrata tried this morning to stop the blue bike, discovering that it had a speed of 125 km/h when it left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continued his movement on Burgess Road, then rolled into a bushland, leaving the police out of sight of him.
A motorcycle and a man matching the driver's description were seen near a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarre.
Carrata police accused a 20-year-old man of refusing to stop and driving dangerously.
He must appear before the Carrata Court of Justice on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.
The school year in the DPD will not start before October
The school year will not start on 1 September, as only 10 per cent of children are in the region.
This was reported by the Minister of Education and Science of the self-proclaimed Republic, Igor Costenok.
He said that 11 per cent of students had gone to other regions of Ukraine and 20 per cent had gone to Russia.
Schools in DPRN-controlled areas will not start before 1 October.
However, the teachers will come to work on September 1.
The investigation into the TU-204 disaster in Vnukova completed in 2012
The Russian Investigative Committee completed the criminal investigation of the TU-204 crash at Vnukovo airport in December 2012.
This has been reported to the UK today.
“The Moscow Inter-Regional Investigative Authority on Transport of the Russian Investigative Committee has completed an investigation into the criminal case brought on account of the crash of a TU-204 aircraft by Red Wings at Vnukovo airport on 29 December 2012 on the grounds of a crime under article 263, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation / a breach of the rules on the safety of traffic and the operation of air transport resulting in the death of two or more persons/” is stated in the report of the agency.
The cause of the disaster was the failure of the crew to follow the standard procedures and the increased speed at which they landed.

Judge Lady Ray scheduled the High Court hearing in Edinburgh on November 17.
Lavrov: Russia will not shut the door because of new sanctions and will not withdraw from the World Trade Organization
Russia will not "clap the door" because of new sanctions.
Sergey Lavrov, head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, announced this today, speaking to students and teachers of the MGIMO.
With regard to our response to a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything must be specifically calculated,' he said.
And when we find out what European and American partners are like this time, then we'll decide how to respond.
This will not involve slaming doors, some sort of resentment, misunderstood,' stressed the Minister.
Above all, we will be distracted from our interests, our interests to protect our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business, and will draw conclusions from the actions of our partners to ensure that they are adequate, contractable and secure.
Following the steps taken in the area of sanctions, it was possible to judge very well what partners were doing, and the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation continued.
If the whole voice says that "they'll hurt us, too, but we have to do it to punish Russia," it's probably not very appropriate."
As far as the World Trade Organization is concerned, the withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions is not.
On the contrary, we want to become more familiar with the tools of the World Trade Organization, including when it comes to trade disputes,” said Lavrov.
We have already used this tool to overcome what we believe is the EU's anti-dumping policy.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping, while applying anti-dumping measures against Russian economic sectors.
“We are willing to engage in the mechanisms of the World Trade Organization and in order to defend our position that the third EU power plant should not be applied in a retrospective manner,” said Lavrov.
How do you use beard in the design of the garden?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since grayberries lose their main attraction after blooming, they are preferred to be planted along with other bushes.
It combines perfectly with many cultures.
And you can and should plant both plants that are decorative in a different time frame and bloom simultaneously with the siren.
And the other thing that's positive is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stamp tree of various heights, an improved bush, a bush with a broad base, and even a sort of garden bonsae, a tree with a bizarrely curved trunk.
Just choose the form that fits the design of your garden.
In Karelia, for selling counterfeit money, a resident of Leningrad Oblast was convicted
According to the national Ministry of Internal Affairs, a man was engaged in his criminal activities in the Olonetsk and Segego districts.
In addition to Karelia, he has committed similar crimes in other parts of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in inheriting the Volhogoda region, where he had been sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment in the spring of this year.
Later the man appeared before the Olonets District Court.
And to complete the investigation of crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segejo.
The investigation proved guilty of several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money in the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the prosecution file was sent to court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to commute the sentence of imprisonment to four years in a general-regime colony.
The sentence has not entered into force.
Remember, last week there were two other counterfeit money salesmen convicted of paying for it in the stores of Petrazavodsk.
Citizens of Azerbaijan also came from St. Petersburg to Karelia.
One is five years' imprisonment and the other four years' imprisonment.
A fine of 500,000 roubles has been ordered for each.
The sentence has not yet entered into force.
Archangels celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy of the Durvish.
The meeting, which took place in the district centre, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
The Durvish delivered military assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
In archangelsk, a rally of memory took place at the foundation stone of a future monument to the northern convoys, which is located on the coast of Sedov in Solombal.
The event brought together representatives of the archangelian Veteran organizations, children from the Cadets class.
We first met twenty-three years ago when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time today's event is not a holiday, but a day of reminiscence for those not returned by the sea," remarked Boris Karpov, chairman of the North Sea Veterans' Board.
Then the town's spiritual band played the event, and the children of the Cadet classes gave the Veterans flowers and marched with Russian flags and the banner of victory.
The meeting ended with the placing of flowers on the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of uniform boots, tin, wool and many other tools and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were on board: 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Harrikane fighter aircraft, in an unpacked state.
At the same time, the convoy's escort consisted of 16 British Navy ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The ship's caravan was not found by the enemy and reached its destination, Archangelska.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 lost their lives and about 50 lost their lives.

Remembering the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis have proposed a bill under which trade union organizations are protected as civil law.
"Where the trade union is, there are middle-class jobs," said Allison, a Minnesota democracy, who is the co-chair of the Progressive Fracture Congress.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Workers' Extension Act along with the symbol of the civil rights movement, John Lewis.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade union organizations as against other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of trade union opponents
Modify the Workplace Management Act to allow workers who experience discrimination for participating in trade union organizations to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least by American standards.
Actually, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis, and the drafters of the bill are talking about is to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks that trade unionists have suffered in recent years -- in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states around the country -- Americans have once supported countries around the world in accepting, extending and respecting labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remembered when that country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware of the role that workers and their trade union play in forming a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the workers' right to organize, to negotiation and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwayne David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the need for workers to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans had included an article which had openly stated: "The right to form associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to everyone and to every profession or activity.
Any agreement that restricts or attempts to interfere with this right will not have legal effect; measures to that end will be considered illegal.
When the former First Lady of Eleonor Rousselt was chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which had drawn up the World Declaration on Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, the United Nations and the drafters had included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade union in order to defend their interests”.
In generations, Americans have accepted as a proper foundation that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade union -- and to have the union participate as an equal partner in collective negotiation with corporations and government institutions -- should be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the nation's forces, but has increased them.
By raising the living standards of millions, trade unionists have wonderfully created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unionists forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers what it should us to do.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against trade union organizations - was long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis have restored ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks the law that could shut down all the Abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the U.S., a federal judge temporarily blocked the application of the Louisiana Act on Sunday, about which his advocates say that he is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by the governor of Louisiana, Bobbi Ginadl, in June, and was to take effect on 1 September, the doctors who perform the abortions would be obliged to be able to receive patients in the hospital within a radius of 30 miles from their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that doctors can still perform legal abortions by continuing to seek such authorization.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to exercise power," wrote Judge John de Gravells in his judgment.
The hearing will be scheduled within the month at which the judge will render a more permanent decision under this law.
The advocates for the right to abort gladly met this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority.
"Today's decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from the insidious law, which seeks to deny them their health and rights," said Nancy Northap, President and Head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed a motion to stop the law on behalf of three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately apparent whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who had not submitted a complaint in the case and also applied for permission to attend.
Louisiana is part of the 11 states that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abort, along with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on the power of reception place restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion objected that such measures were intended to protect women's health, although some also mentioned their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs an abort in Louisiana has the power to attend the hospital, has reported to the Centre for Recreational Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state had to stop doing this procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would have stopped doing it, the group reported.
Criticizing this decision, the officers of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors who performed an abort while their applications for permission to receive a decision were pending.
The result of the introduction of quota for domestic products
At least half of the products for each product in a range of trade networks should be produced by Russia; Oleg Neilov, a member of the State Duma of the Fair Russia faction, considers them to be Russian.
The Parliamentarian has prepared a bill to introduce protective measures against domestic producers, which is published by the newspaper Izvestia.
The document will be detailed in order to avoid possible discomfort for customers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia; for the rest of the products produced in Russia, the Riteiller will be required to provide at least half of its shelf to domestic producers,” Nilov reported to the publication.
Together with the changes made to the article “On the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation”, the bill provides for a revision of the tax code to set a lower VAT rate of 10 per cent for the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea of a 50% quota in trade networks is part of a package of incentive measures for Russian producers.
There will be multiple times more domestic goods on the counters.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, say experts.
According to the lawyer of the tax company, Sergei Litvinenko, a member of the independent expert centre of the Public Duma, for the Russian economy and for the domestic farming and food sectors, will have a positive effect and will result in an increase.
The pros will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means they'll get more.
Moreover, they would be allowed to dictate their terms and prices to the retellers, as they would be obliged to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activity and sales, resulting in higher taxes than ever.
This will increase the revenue of the budget, create new jobs, and some sectors will start to expand, some quicker learning will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's vulnerability to foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately," the expert notes.
Formerly, Russian businesses were often unable to access local shops because of the high competition of foreign analogues.
Now, after the imposition of the Embargo, this hole has been set free and can be sighed with relief.
But let us not forget that, after all the necessary arrangements and health checks, food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be supplied to the Russian market.
In other words, now is the moment of calm, when the former players are gone and the new players have not yet arrived.
About a month later, we can talk about an increased demand for domestic raw materials as well as an increase in the prices of finished products,” said AIF.ru, the first vice president of the Russian public organization, the Russian Financial Directors' Club, and Tamara Kasianov.
It is clear that the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food in each category will enable the sector to be secured by local producers.
They would then compete with each other rather than with goods which, with subsidies from another State, were cheaper.
In other words, the competition for the purchaser will take place between companies operating under the same industry law.
On the other hand, Kasianov notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of their compatriots by far not all articles.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to “create” the share of Russian goods up to half the range.
As a result, there are growing fears that poor goods will be supplied to the counters.
Perhaps, under the guise of production in Russia, foreign products will be supplied with broken labels,” the expert adds.
Large trade networks will experience negative effects from quota implementation, especially those that are more likely to work with importers.
It is logical that foreign providers themselves will suffer as demand for their products decreases.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the domestic goods quota law may affect consumers as well.
The fact is, some Russian products may yield by the quality of imported analogues, while shops may be able to inflate the price of the second product as a scarce product.
The idea of importing in the early 2000s was rediscovered by economists in February this year because of the continued devaluation of the ruble.
Now, in the face of a difficult relationship with the West, the issue of non-importing products becomes even more urgent.
The law is intended to require retellers to be treated by domestic producers when ordering vendors.
Then we'll go much faster and more confidently on the way to import, and the product planning system will be put in place in a shorter time frame,” says MP Oleg Neilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism will be available for those sectors where capacity is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really capable of completely covering Russian stores.
In addition, meat production can generate a strong impulse.
As is known, the largest share of imports is found for beef, between 30 and 35 per cent.
It turns out that 65 to 70 percent of the total is still Russian,” says Kasyanov.
The experts are of the view that the introduction of quota for domestic products will contribute to import and may accelerate this process.
However, this initiative will not in itself lead to import, as it requires a set of measures, I believe Lithuanianko.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative could still be imported from abroad, which meant that no full import would take place, but significant steps would be taken.
Moreover, there is not enough quota, and domestic product production is still needed to meet these quota levels.
The quota data will provide exactly such guarantees,” the expert notes.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment means that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia face a higher risk of ovarian cancer than urban women.
Researchers analyzed disease maps of over 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after diagnosis.
The lead researcher, Susan Jordan, of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research, reported that the probability of dying during the study is 20 percent higher for those living in the state's regions and remote areas than for those living in urban areas.
A LONG STUDY: New drugs can slow lung cancer and ovarian cancer
Researchers have followed women's medical path in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the existence of current diseases and the social and economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rate.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecology, and they are mostly in large cities," she said.
Despite improvements in the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of out-of-area services that would enable professionals to treat women closer to home and support programs for people in treatment far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Chancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast of Elisha Nive was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open the door in the Kujener district
The construction of a health facility in the village of Toktybelek was started in April of this year and was based on a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of Chapter Mary Al, funding for the construction of the site was financed from the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the facility under construction is nearly 230 square metres.
It will provide health care to the inhabitants of eight localities: the village of Toktyebelak and the villages of Dementievo, Püncheryumal, Thunia, Fomichi, Toribelak, Sinur and Cheskayal.
The new health centre would replace the existing FAP, whose building had been built in 1918 and had long exhausted its resources and its premises were not in keeping with health and health requirements.
A new institution will be opened shortly.
Killing a four-month-old drunk son will be tried
The woman in Chuvashi will be at the bench for murdering her own child.
In Ceboxar, a criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novohkossar, accused of causing death due to carelessness, has been completed.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year the accused, together with his four-month-old son, had come to celebrate the birth of his family's child in Ceboxar.
After a long dinner, the new-school nurse decided to stay and put the baby to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, a sober woman put it next to her bed to feed her breast, but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman fell on her son and died of asphyxiation.
The criminal case, reported by the U.S. Press Service of the U.S.C. for Chuvashi, has been brought to court.
Inflation's out of vacation.
Whether Russians will feel a sharp price rise
As a result of the Russian Federation's and the West's cross sanctions, inflation in Russia will accelerate and fall short of government projections, and the analysts of the BTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions will result in an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writing to RBC Daily.
According to the latest projections by the Ministry of Economic Development, inflation in 2014 will be between 1.5 and 7.5 per cent, down from 6.5 per cent in the following year.
However, according to the newspaper Commercials, this week the MER is expected to make “small but principled” adjustments to the macro-economy forecast before the year 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could lower the estimate of inflation for 2015, which would eliminate the expected loss of population income.
The forecast assumed that Russian food sanctions were in effect for a year up to August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation suggests a one-time shock, but the declining inflation rate will not change," said the newspaper's source in Minfin.
The BTBS capital economists do not share the government's expectations for inflation and forecast a price increase of 8% in 2014.
The main effect of food bans will take place together with the possible introduction of sales taxes (NCPs) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, and experts are convinced.
An inflationary peak of 9% will take place in February, after which the annual rate of price increases will decline, according to experts.
By the way, last week Rossstat failed the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation had introduced "smart sanctions."
AIF.ru interviewed the experts and found out their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deyev, Head of the Analysis Department of the FC AForex:
Prices are already rising for major segments of goods.
Moreover, when social goods began to be valued, the Government was obliged to initiate system-wide price stability monitoring to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Vendors and retaliators are already reporting on a daily basis to the regulators to make sure that the authorities know exactly who, when and why the price increases are triggered.
The key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rate of capital outflows, the over-investment of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure were to remain under control, the value of the minimum product basket would not increase by 12% in one quarter alone.
The ban on food imports had caused a supply shock on the domestic market and had led to a perfectly logical increase in the final value.
Since we are currently unable to fully launch the import mechanism and to improve the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the sanctions will continue to bear the risks of inflationary growth.
By the end of this year, inflation may well exceed 8% if we add the fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in national currency, as well as the declining prospects for economic growth.
Alexander Rasuwaev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
Inflation sometimes reached 20 to 30 percent a month in the 1990s, and zero inflation was also above the current level, another thing that was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think the year's inflation will be 8-8.5 percent.
Maguta's Plateau, U.K. asset manager, Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still being successfully restrained, but if there is further pressure, above all on the financial sector, it can lead to some difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually reflected in the purchase of cash currency in order to secure their saving.
It can be assumed that the government, the Russian Federation's CB and the Ministry of Finance will try to ease the smooth weakening of the ruble by both market methods and government regulations.
But the price rise starts traditionally after a summer calm and may become more visible this fall.
Russia's target of 7.5 per cent for consumer inflation is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial reserves.
The garden centers are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, due to the exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, may cause horticulture centers to lose tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the "main age of gardening," according to a study by HTA reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, renters spend on average 55 percent of the sum spent on gardening by homeowners.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of the parking house and the reduction of the size of the garden as other factors threatening an industry whose annual sales are estimated at £5 billion.
In Greater London, where homeowners dropped from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the lowest spending rate in Britain on gardeners' goods per household.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society reported that renting and lack of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the principal gardener at the RHS, said, "Population in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can transport plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden age” of the retail trade in horticulture goods as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year because of better weather following the bad conditions of March and April last year.
Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture carried out mass cleaning at the Earth Islands Foundation
Three of the four heads of the Earth Islands Foundation were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Earthland Foundation were replaced on Friday.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture reported only the removal of Atanas Dogov as Executive Director.
Lozan Vasilyev took his place.
It turns out that two of the three deputy directors of the fund were changed quietly on Friday.
The Assistant Executive Director, Tatiana Angelov, who had been responsible for State assistance and the SAPARD programme, has been released, reports to BGNES with a reference to the newspaper Trudd.
I didn't attend the foundation's board because by law we're not members of management, but I was later informed that I was released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal is not reported on the foundation's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I'll find out more on Monday," said Angelov.
Ivanka Bagdatov, who was still the head of "Investment Credit" at a central foundation in "Landland" in Sofia, will take her place.
Nikolai Dachev, Vice-Director, was also released.
Until then he was responsible for direct subsidies for the fields paid by the EU.
He will be appointed to the position of Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the Regional Administration of the Earthdelia Foundation in the city of Veljtinov until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the Atije Foundation, Aliyev-Velí, remained in office.
It is currently responsible for the rural development programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey summons an American diplomatic in connection with a report of spying
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the highest-level US diplomatic in the country to explain the report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Under-Prime Minister Bulent reported that the American C.E. and Turkish officials had discussed the message on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept reported that documents submitted by former US National Security Analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a priority intelligence site for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyyip Erdogan, has minimized the importance of this message, saying that all leading countries are spying on each other.
Previous reports that the German main intelligence agency had also made Antarctica a target of intelligence have caused a more angry response from the Turkish government.
The largest Chinese companies joined against Alibaba
Chinese companies, among which the largest commercial real estate developer in China is the Danish Wanda Group and the Internet Giants Tencent Holdings (Society, Messinger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine) are creating a company that will compete online with Alibaba.
However, catching up on the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left even its American opponents, eBay and Amazon.com, behind, will not be easy.
Union of Majors
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in a joint venture, 70% of them will belong to Wanda, and 15% each to an Internet company, says Wanda Group.
The company is scheduled to be registered in Hong Kong.
JS will combine Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fair hotels, Wanda runs at least 49 commercial properties across China and 40 trade centers.
Last year the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than 8 billion dollars) in the construction of a film studio and a theme park in Chindao (a town in eastern China on the shore of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors per year and generate a profit of $960 million per year.
Wanda also owns the AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the world's largest cameraman.
By 2015, Wanda was planning to provide all its trade centers, hotels and entertainment places with e-commerce services, which would be developed by the newly created competitor Aliba.
According to Dun Ce, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should be the world's largest platform online-to-offline, notes Dong Ce.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) is to attract customers online to go to regular offline stores or to buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sale of coupons like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "bird" in online commerce," said Wang Jianlin, head of Wanda (quota on Bloomberg).
"Now there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation everyone's chances are about equal," he says.
The Chinese Internet market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will increase to $395 billion by more than three times by 2015, compared to 2011.
The number of Chinese Internet users has risen to 632 million, bringing official statistics to Bloomberg: this is the largest population in the world except India.
And it's projected that by 2015, that number could grow to 850 million.
Union of the Rich
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten was until recently the richest man in China, but according to the Bloomberg millionaire index, the founder of Alibaba, Jack Mae, had already exceeded it by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's fortune is estimated at $11.8 billion, of which $11 billion is spent on his share in Alibaba.
The Baidu leader, Robin Lee, is now ranked third among the richest people in China, while Wang Jianglin of Wanda is the fourth point of the rating.
"It's very interesting to see that the three richest people are working together to challenge the even richer," said Bloomberg, director of the Chinese e-commerce research centre in Hangzhou Tsao Lai.
But he thinks that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba right after its creation: "Rome can't be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not just competitive not only with new companies, but also with well-deserved leaders of the world's Internet trade is reflected in a report published the previous quarter on the financial performance of Aliba.
Alibaba is often described as the average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company earned more than its two American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit over the period is almost twice as high as the sum of the total competitors; it grew almost three times in annual terms to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a huge potential to generate money, largely because of its mobile applications," comments Bloomberg's report by an analyst from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba site of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company's active mobile service users in July were 188 million, well above the March rate (163 million).
However, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba has to specify the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 Bloomberg analysts, the company could be valued at $187 billion after selling shares.
According to Bloomberg's sources, Aliba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could already take place on September 16.
The Road-show company preceding this event will start on September 3.
It is expected that Aliba's IPO release will be a record in NYSE history and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the US stock market record was owned by the Visa payment system, which in 2008 made a primary investment of $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food in the trade networks should be produced by Russia, and the members of the State were considered to be State Members.
They have drawn up a bill on this subject.
These are the changes made to article 8 of the FM “On the basis of government regulating trade in the Russian Federation” and to the tax code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
According to the bill, at least 50 per cent of the products produced locally in shops should be for each product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruit in winter, so they will be given a discount to avoid possible discomfort for customers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the tax code of the Russian Federation, setting a lower VAT rate of 10 per cent for the sale of all food items of which Russia is the country of origin, as reported by the newspaper Izvestia.
On 27 August, a bill was submitted to the Lower House of Parliament to amend the FS “On the Retail Markets” which suggests that farmers' markets be revived in Russia, where small-scale producers will be able to sell their products.
Chief of the Magaluf police is charged with corruption
The plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the city of Calvia to the State prosecutor's office on Friday.
The head of the Calvian police in the Mallorca resort island was arrested as a result of charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the scandalous Mawalupe's unbridled drinking centre.
The Chief Inspector, Jose Antonio Navarro, was detained as a result of charges of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street where most of the Magaluf clubs and clubs are located.
According to the daily online Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the city of Calvia to the Malorca anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
Two more local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard for corruption charges and will be interrogated by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that the disgruntled owners of nightclubs say that protectionism by the authorities seriously affects their business.
"It's no longer about earning money, it's about surviving," said one of the businessmen to the court.
We must not compromise our sources of existence.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was hit in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer who blows up 24 men in a bar race.
The island's authorities have since tried to stop drunken hooliganism among the resting Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandalous alcoholic runs in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the blowjob incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and Carnage rans were fined for €55,000 ($73000).
The Magaluf Tourist resort, mostly popular among young British vacationers, was also the site of numerous accidents in a state of drunkenness associated with the crazy fun known as "balconing" when people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to the airport of Adelaide
WARNING prepared a cold surprise in South Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
An additional 5 mm rain fell on the city by 9 p.m. in the evening, followed by the 6.6 mm which fell in the Sunday night.
The last rain was followed by a couple of brief rains with a violent wind, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter released the early spring last week, the temperature dropped again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8C in the city.
The squillistic conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but hit the wind shift zone--a sudden change in speed or direction of the wind at short distance--and was forced to climb the height.
The wind waves reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to rise during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused the delay of several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is predicted in Adelaide on Tuesday, with a probability of one or two rains.
Calculation of construction projects in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The issues of price formation, building industry management and network connections are under special control by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The FAS has set up an expert board for the promotion of competition in the construction sector.
At its meeting, Vadim Solovyev, Head of the FAC Control, Construction and Natural Resources Authority, stated that “the current calculation of the construction budget is completely incomprehensible”.
The legal basis makes price formation opaque and can lead to an unreasonable construction price, considered by the FAS.
And they offer the cost of building public objects at the design stage to determine design based on market prices instead of the currently estimated standards and single costs for technology operations.
These proposals have been put on the road map and are currently under consideration in a ministro.
"Replacing traditional construction estimates by calculating design elements should result in less corruption in the industry," explained Vadim Solovev's "RGB".
Because the estimate now calculates each bolt and ball, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, uninformed construction companies can bury the "integrity of the tractor."
The M.O.S. agrees with the FAS.
"The first work on costing design elements is already in place: methods for calculating the prices of design solutions, for calculating estimates on these indicators," said the "RGB" head of the city planning department and the architecture of the Jelena Zhukov ministros.
Road construction has been selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the RGB head of the Pro-Invest Construction Company, Anatoly Demianco, said, the estimated standards are old, but no other business mechanism has yet been offered.
“With regard to the proposed calculation of the design elements, it is difficult in practice, since construction of buildings often employs very different technologies,” he considers.
It's no secret that the construction market is growing in large part because of government orders.
According to the chairman of the NPA, the "Expert Community of Professionals of State Order" by Catharina Lezina, today the State is the most solvent employer.
The Assistant Director for Engineering of the Rosatom Branch Capital Construction Centre, Vladimir Malakhov, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to the contract file and companies that own and do not allow competitors to do so.
He believed that a transparent market could be created only if access to a contract was maximized from someone's influence.
On the panel of experts, it was suggested that a system of government orders should be established in such a way that the same performer could not obtain more than one contract for more than 1 billion roubles or several for more than 1 billion roubles.
This approach is believed to have to be evaluated in terms of business impact as well as efficiency in building management.
As explained by Helena Zhukov, in this case it will be necessary to provide the employer with the functions of a designer, which will result in an increase in the customer's staff and budget costs for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer's expertise will need to be able to evaluate the quality of the work performed by the contracted organizations as well as their safety.
Often, such a breakdown will need to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the diversion of highly skilled public purchasers due to a lack of interest in receiving a government partial order and a small amount of the contract.
Alexander Eustashenkov, the head of the Institute of Purchasing Resources and Consulting, believes that the State Order process has now become a business game for the carefulness of the contractor.
An example was given: "a party, when filling in an application, should specify "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent," "must be," "of," "more," "less", "appeared", "or", "typical", "no lower," "might", "may," "may," "may," "might be," "not earlier," "not earlier," "not above," "not allowed" etc.
Thus, clients often abuse their right to specify the content of an application submitted by the contracting organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ, in the view of Eustachenkov, was the need to evaluate the quality of work at the application stage through a paper offer from the party.
When considering the application of the bidder, it is only possible to evaluate the performance of the vendor, but not the quality of the work which has not even begun, the expert suggests.
The quality of the work can only be evaluated when it is accepted.
On the panel of experts, it was also suggested that the margin of income from the top to the bottom be moved so that intermediates would disappear.
The chairman of the expert board, the State secretary, FAS vice-director Andrey Czarovsky, believes that this should not be done, as the manager should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it's like in a famous reprisal of Arkady Rikin's Athele, "Do you have a problem with buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday, after spending the summer in bomb shelter, when rockets and mines rained on their villages during the 50-day Israeli-UNMIL war, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the Territory recovered from the fighting.
The beginning of the school was a source of joy and excitement to the rocket-stricken villages of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the Pashos children's garden, which had been hit by a rocket, removed traces of fragments from walls and rollers before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're happy to look into the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibuza Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our neighborhood really need to get back to normal life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly she would start going back to school "a little weird."
"There was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our houses at all," she said.
President Rivlin visited the Kibbutz, which is close to the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the cease-fire halted the war last week, thousands of inhabitants of border towns such as Sa'ad did not go outside or left their homes, leaving the Gaza Strip for safer areas to escape from rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy had been killed by a piece of a Palestinian mine, doubted whether they should go back.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which had made a great deal of effort from Palestinian fire.
He told the children to study carefully and said, "We will do our utmost to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The cease-fire immediately put an end to the fighting, but key issues remained unanswered, such as the demand by Hamas for the lifting of the Israeli- Egyptian siege on Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of the two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
A new phase of indirect talks is expected to start later this month in Egypt.
More than 1,200 Palestinians, three quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, were estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations, lost their lives in the war.
Israel challenges these figures and asserts that at least half of those killed were members of the armed forces; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other elements of Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
Meanwhile, the Israeli army carried out over 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of houses in the Gaza Strip had been damaged and destroyed, and it was estimated that 250,000 people had taken refuge in more than 100 schools, which had been converted into shelter.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelter and fighting continued, education officials last week postponed the beginning of the school year.
"I hope the school will soon open so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Muhammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a school in Gaza.
According to popular criteria, real estate prices have shown the greatest winter growth in seven years.
The housing price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, and RP data was reported by RP data on Monday.
This increase led to a cumulative increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as high as 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
The RP Data Director, Tim Lawless, reported that Sydney and Melbourne run a two-tier market.
The RP Data figures show that in Sydney the price of apartments has risen by 16.1 per cent in the last year, while in Melbourne the rate has risen by 11.7 per cent.
The next largest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged between five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government spending cuts took place, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties placed on the market within the next few months, which will be a "true test" for the market.
"Bearing in mind the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high sales rate and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the value of the dwelling will still increase in the next three months," he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of the gold industry and the landlords of Yevdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October revolution to the city of October to the Greater Casanski, there are 18 apartments.
The 18th century house has not changed much since the construction, except for the old age.
Strangers come here as a field trip, and the inhabitants suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege of living in the oldest Ufim house, whose walls remember the general Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the building is not exact, and historians point to two dates: 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out that the building is 300 years old.
Old courtyard, always open door, violin staircase.
The doors to the apartment are located close to each other, the walls are cracked, and the street is visible in the glare of the shrouded plaster.
It looks like it's all about honesty.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's true."
Living in an 18th-century wooden house is very difficult, says Tatiana Lucianov, a resident of apartment 3.
The site is in the state's custody, but no money has been spent for decades, and we feel like museum artifacts that the authorities have just forgotten.
Last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still holding tight, but the foundation is rotten.
Many lodgers still go to the toilet outside and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be satisfied under such circumstances?
The road passes right under the windows, and there's not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana moves the curtain.
Now you can see what you've only heard before: there's a stream of cars under the windows.
You see, the glass is dim all the time, the windows can't open, but the noise is getting used to.
You get used to it, you get used to it, you get used to it.
Our apartment is still fine, thanks to his husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, the three of us live with our son.
And other families have a much worse situation, and on the second floor, the ceilings are a little over a mile high.
To contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment 6 to meet Ludmile Elderly.
A nice hospitable woman from the door offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a single-room apartment, 14.5 meters per four people, and we live with my husband and my daughter and my granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there was no other apartment ever,--Ludmila turns her eyes around a room: an antressoli, two couches with a letter of "g"; on one of them a granddaughter with a laptop placed.
Very close and very different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But there's a regular flow from the ceiling: the pipe system's bad.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment as usual and astonishingly at the same time as an Italian woman whose house is on Roman ruins.
So it's one very old and recent, everyday and legendary thing:
The water pipe was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a little kitchen in a corner and a toilet from the former closet.
We live just where Demids and his family lived, and there were servants on the second floor.
Our apartment hasn't been privatized, and why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Center, they say that it doesn't matter.
We'll only get a single-room apartment anyway, we can't claim any more.
Four months ago, we were promised to dissolve, but the promise went on.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
This apartment (room!) had a whole dynasty: my grandparents, my mom and dad, my husband and my daughter and my granddaughter.
Things have been going on in that time.
For example, big rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the fridge, they're a meter thick!
They say the solution was connected to the eggs, so it's been holding up for so long.
The house is well built, thanks to Demids!
That's probably the only reason why nobody's been killed by a broken ceiling or their own.
Only the building is slowly dying in front of us: the board and the woods of the house are rotting, the floors have fallen repeatedly, we have poured cement, but it's useless -- the solution goes into the ground, like a well.
They say it is, under our room a secret stairwell and a walk to the White River, which deliberately made the ancients that once lived here, to be able to escape danger, if anything.
They were chased.
Ludmila Old Austin tells us how some historian came to see them, begged to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then he convinced me to give them a place to live in exchange for his one in October.
Ludmila, a historian, refused:
Where are we four in one?
And here, at least a tiny hope is that it'll give you a bigger apartment.
If we agreed to the exchange, we wouldn't have won anything.
However, the old people's family won nothing.
Ludmila's biggest dream to be scattered, and a daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
So two families have set aside a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations live.
The cute, miniature girl Olesha Karsakov from apartments 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, her large family lives in two close rooms with a total area of 23 square feet [23 m2] called apartments.
There are seven of us, two of us.
You can see what the conditions are.
The piece falls off, like the window frames, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms, through holes.
The water in the tap all year long is only cold.
By passing through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, you can make sure that the most fortunate of all are the Lorrentev's wives in apartment 4.
They occupy the most extensive rooms in the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
It's 75 squares, it's three people.
We live in exactly the room where the legend is that Suvorov stayed while he was in Ufa, says the head of the family Alexander Dmitriyevich Lawrence.
The ceilings are tall, spacious.
One thing's bad, it's all mooring around, it's falling apart, it's falling apart.
Neighbors must have told you!
The most painful thing we've had with the floors is that the wooden boards are rotting, and the earth is literally gone from under our feet.
I've put up the mats, the bowels; there's nothing else in the hall, and in the other room we walk like a swing, so shaky.
Alexander Dmitrijewicz, a merchant of Eudokim Demidov, can best tell about the house of any traveller.
A gold industryman is treated as a native, speaks admirably of him.
Indeed, the identity was extraordinary: the owner of the Kagin and Ujiang factories built houses, poured out guns and bells, and held the Ural mines.
The heirs of the property are proud of their ancestors, but they don't want to live under the same roof as history anymore.
I lived here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitriyevich.
Then there were wooden carriages, stables, and guard booths, which were then demolished.
In 1968 they wanted to clean up our house, but something prevented...
The story recurred in 2014 and was re-entered.
As a team, we collected all the documents, ran through the right authorities, and suddenly we found out that moving to the apartment was moving to 2015, or 2016.
Somethin' doesn't believe in all this anymore...
Two years ago, Lawrence went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bascortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The officials did not accept the lodger.
Sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, issued a paper without signature or printing, saying, "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the settlement of the inhabitants."
I even felt like our house hadn't been in town for a long time, because it was first number 57, then it was 57 A, and now it's quarter.
It's as if it was already destroyed in the '70s.
The Russian Planet has approached the head of the land administration information and analysis sector, Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
It is part of the old settlement programme.
I can't take responsibility for the actions of officials in the 1970s, but I know there was a plan at the time to tear down all the old houses, despite the historical importance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of modern authorities to rebuild all old houses along the October Revolution Street, representing architectural value, has been successfully implemented.
The inhabitants are about to be resettled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, the reconstruction of Demidov's house will involve Italian professionals who have been involved in the restoration of buildings in Vienna.
Italy now has an architectural biennal, and the Old Ufa project is presented there, among other things.
Hopefully, by 2016, the entire old Casanian street will be restored, says the official.
Homes will become suitable for what was before, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to be an open museum for all.
In addition, at the government level, a decision was made to make the street a walker on weekends.
On a weekday, unfortunately, it's not going to work, too much of the city's roads.
Vladimir Barabash promises to settle people from a future museum in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same square as the current ones.
Only from a different age.
A forest fire broke out in the sea because of the storm.
The dry storm caused a forest fire in the hunting district of the Primorsky region.
At the site of the fire, a build-up of forces and means is under way.
According to the leadership of the General Assembly, the conditions created at the site of the fire require the engagement of the air force.
Vasily Medvedev, deputy head of the airbase:
An observation pilot from an An-2 aircraft in an area of 3 hectare found a fire in an inaccessible area.
Burning wood leftovers on an old burner.
A strong area and steep slope of over 45 degrees, the absence of suitable fire landing sites creates considerable difficulty in extinguishing.
We need an MI-8 helicopter.
The deployment of the airbase with the MI-2 and AN-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the discovery of the fire, four parachute firemen were quickly planted.
The main task of professionals is to extinguish fire and to prepare a site for the delivery of additional fire-fighting equipment.
In the area of lunch, three additional paratroopers were transported by helicopter to the village of Hunter.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the area of fire is ready, the specialist will be moved to the location of the extinguishment and will be posted on the website of the administration of the maritime region.
My father never hugged me.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrants' family from Jamaica in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19 years old, worked at the factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry's rehearsing a comedy, "The Rooty Rocks," which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew up from a series of radio 4 shows.
Soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and melodies are cheerful.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was a lot of treatment, and Henry often pondered about his father's relationship.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice say, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the form of a beer, the beauty of a blow in cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an insensitive guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a paint shop in Dudley and, although the conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to see what his life must have been.
It's a little better there now, but it's dark, smoky, deep, deep, deep, deep, with fire and smoke and lots of soot.
My father was climbing into the bathtub and just lying there, and you heard him slowly starting to sing about himself because he wanted to wash himself from the paint shop.
When I got there, I realized that he was doing it for years and years to earn us a living, and I began to value him more.
However, Henry came out of childhood without parents' love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when mom got sick at the very end of her life did we start saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he needed as a child.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don French.
Why shouldn't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, with whom he's been married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother herself had Diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got really, really well and I had symptoms of diabetic, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
So I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to take a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry's career trajectory is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he got a confession from the critics for his Othello, he's gone completely into the theatre.
She followed the "Fault comedy" and then August Wilson's "Storages".
This work is different from sitcoms and comedy, which were an inseparable attribute of his busy professional life.
He began his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him parading on the stage, and wrote about him in "New Faces."
His TV career began in the middle of the '70s: "For a long time I was the only black parody/comic on TV."
He went to school at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I had to learn to be an efficient car to deliver jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lennie in "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the Black and White Messler Show, a light entertainment program in which people "blacked their face," Henry found out that he had been doing it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of want it never to happen to me, but I don't wish I hadn't.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I worked on large sites and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the reward of an easy entertainment classical on British television years and years" was "a thriving parody of black people."
Presenting the characters who had abused the culture of blacks in the UK and sang it, Henry worked in an alternate comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of "Lennie Henry's Show" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known, among other things, as Chief Guerret Blacklock of the "Shef!" comedy series.
Advertising videos, documentary movies, TV series and the role in the movies took over the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC show "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're dragging time or moving away."
And then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's Good in...?"
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
You can't say that I'm being trained to do that in high school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the responsibility of the middle-class white people with tights and cabbage at the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everybody we were interviewing for the show, Peter Hall, and Carrie Nan, Adrian Leicester, and Judy Dench, they said, "You need to try.
Don't curse it till you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines of Othello's last monologue for a documentary, and he got caught.
I had a feeling I could do it.
It's like my head was fixed.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, teach your text, do a little study.
So the rehearsal process was hard, and I read this play months and months before we set it up.
And she was a success.
They seemed to have been waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the "Fault comedy."
Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it till the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his case was to entertain the audience.
"Silent voice inside me said, "You'll have to work 10 minutes while they fix the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let somebody else handle this.
"You play in the play, stay in the role."
Henry's at the Duchess Theatre.
It was hard to learn the text for the fences.
Panic is quite useful, it builds muscle.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign from above, showing, "That's what you should do."
He says it, of course, with a grave voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the rehearsal.
By the way, Henry's still thinking comedian -- all the way to our conversation is interrupted by his humor, and when he starts, he stops imagining.
I just decided not to work at the stand-up, because this thing with the instant reward from the full room of strangers, I think, is quite dangerous.
If you keep trying to do this, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work at Apollo Lives whenever I want, but mostly I don't enjoy it as much as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever give a stand-up trip again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle, and end of the road--I don't think I'll ever want to give it up.
So this is his new embodiment?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya has started a biometric registration of all civil servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payment register.
No longer paid to staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks are reported in the government application.
The government suspected that thousands of people continued to earn their wages after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Keniata has promised to reduce corruption in government structures since he came to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700,000) a month was lost by payments to invisible workers and other financial abuses.
The government suspects that wages continue to be paid to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyam Chebusi from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants are required to appear in the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected by means of a biometric registration procedure, as reported in the government application.
Anyone who does not do so without a valid reason will be struck out of the payment register, as reported.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalisation of the civil service by defining the actual number of civil servants and will also be used to clear the payment sheet at both levels of government - hence end the problem of invisible workers," said Ann Wyghur, Cabinet Minister for Planning and Structure of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with a “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the Government” and reported by local news agencies.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detained were 14 high-level officers, according to the report of Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them had participated in the corruption detection exercise last December, which had been designed to screen government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and listening to a telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures being taken against him and others in power by the Islamic cleric Fethullah Guelen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer vacation.
Traditionally, this day is a big occasion for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenius Yakenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told the expected journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
Not every school held a ceremony on September 1.
There is no peaceful sky above every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for peaceful heavens.
The entire Ukraine, the huge Ukrainian common people's front, must fight for peaceful heavens.
Alexan Pastukhov, the principal of a school in Slavansk, where the daughter of Yacenyuk went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study is usually marked by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, he may have found such a powerful leader she needs.
It is followed by a slate of fame from the world of banking, media administration and the Tory party's internal circles.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership.
Her career began at the Bane and Co Global Administration consulting firm and then went on at the Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world in Pearsons.
She had been the head of Financial Times for seven years, retiring when a senior position in Pearson's parent company was held by a male colleague who held a lower position.
They say her income is close to £1 million.
Its political ratings are also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, former head of the BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall; she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband was former councillor Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's work a poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The board has two orientations: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but outside as a voice of public anxiety and excitement when something goes wrong.
It is an almost unattainable duopoly that requires complete radical reform.
But what a new president would risk coming by trampling and ruining an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he were to lose his own work in this process.
It's a difficult decision.
It wouldn't be so hard, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size, after a review of its powers, finance and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge the cozy old habits, inevitable negotiation of license costs is particularly dangerous for BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, British people take a share in the most definitely the largest media company in the world.
BBC tells a good story: it says that it covers 96 percent of households and costs each of them only 40p a day.
Moreover, it is evident that Beeb's popularity is on the rise: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
BBC models have changed: I now get news headers on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and powerful institution.
He needs a powerful chairman -- I hope he found him.
Perry from Texas says that the humiliation tweet was written by someone else.
Twitter from the confirmed account of the Texas governor of Republican Rick Perry on Sunday evening contained an insulting image of the D.A. from the democrats, who is in the center of the prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and followed by another one from Perry's account, in which it was desued.
A tweet was just published from my account, which was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I've removed it," announces a later recording.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to the communications with a request for comments.
Although the entries were downloaded from the confirmed Perry account, it was not clear who was actually publishing the feed.
The earlier tweet contained an ill-fashioned cartoon on the prosecutor of the district of Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol in April 2013.
Perry denied funding for her office when she refused to resign, which led to a trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential candidate for president in the 2016 elections.
The tweet says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of intoxication that is three times the allowable amount of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I charge governor Perry for telling me this."
I'm the drunkest democracy in Texas.
The Lemberg office did not conduct an investigation involving a grand jury against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrome, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political trick.
His strong legal team had asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the charge, arguing that the law used to prosecute a governor who had served longer in Texas's history was vague, contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the state's State Public Control Department, which is based in the county of Travis and pursues corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to retire.
Veto raised a formal complaint from a left-wing public control group.
The feed of Perry's confirmed account is often updated and sometimes becomes famous.
When Perry came to the fifth party meeting in Iowa during his 2012 Presidential campaign, he responded to rumours that he could quit the game by tweeting a picture of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to the "normal state"
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in South East England had returned to normal levels of activity.
Homes in the capital were the subject of intense demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble would push Bank of England to set a limit on mortgages in June.
Tony Peedgely, the founder and chairman of an elite construction company, Berkeley, said on Monday, "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to a normal level of transactions since the peak of 2013, adding that it has provided a "stable working environment."
The London real estate market was successful during the fall, as foreign customers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city have risen by 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land Register, significantly exceeding the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, accessible and student schemes by Berkeley rose by about one fifth last year, reaching £423000 at the end of April.
However, the tightening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign customers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “hension tax” before the next May general election.
The London Foxtons Real Estate Authority last week warned that the April reform of the Mortgage Market, under which tighter loan conditions had been introduced, would also result in a decline in market growth both in real estate sales and in prices in the second half of the year.
Updated data from Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages in June, suggesting a further cooling of the dwelling market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its forecast of a rise in London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent, based on the fact that real estate prices are already weakening.
Meanwhile, transactions dropped by a quarter, compared to the previous year, in the most expensive parts of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, the demand for houses in the capital was very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales volumes above £2.2 billion.
Mr. Peedgely added, "The demand for the right product with the best design and best location remained the same and, reflecting it, sales remained for a long time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year by the end of April, almost a third more than in the pre-Crisis peak of 2007.
The annual pre-tax income rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, and income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Peedgely said that Berkeley's expected income for that year would meet current market expectations.
According to the Unanimity of Analysts, a profit of £450 million is expected all year before taxes are paid.
Berkeley's shares were held on £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence published online
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th annual American Film Academy Prize.
Photos of naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar Prize, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a catalogue of photos of another 100 rising stars.
A representative of the Star "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and condemned the hacker for "invading his privacy."
The law enforcement authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos originally posted on the 4chan photo sharing site were allegedly obtained because of the lack of Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of women famous, including Rihanna, Kim Cardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of these photos are true, although the star "Scott Pilgrim against All" Winstead on Twitter also condemned the break-in.
"The one who looks at the photos that we took with my husband a few years ago in private at home --I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justiz, from "iCarly" and "Victoria the Winner", denied that in the photos she tweeted, "These are the so-called pictures of me nude FALSE, people.
Let me stop it in the foetus.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a representative of the pop star, Ariana Grande, denied that the photos on which she was believed to be real.
Exclusive passage from a new Howard Jacobson novel about love and the letter "J" that exclaimed critics
They disappeared, which is the best way to say, they gradually collapsed, like a cardboard box that was left behind in the rain.
Only sometimes did a woman tell him that he was too serious, heavy in communication, tense, closed and perhaps a little irritating.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw the irritability in himself.
He was like a hunter, yeah.
The last victim of this tempting was a little novel from which he expected more than usual to get rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some sort of satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a tremblingly delicate woman with shredded hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village, even more remote and severe than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, whom Kever considered her aunt, and the last one inherited a house in a raw but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "Paradise Valley."
No one's been living in the house for years.
The pipes flowed, in the bathtubs sitting motionlessly, the slugs left their traces on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden sprouted with weeds that looked like giant nostrils of cabbage.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both frightening and tempting, with a full secret garden.
The author's look was by Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the 2014 Booker Lounge.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Kevern and Aileen were sitting by their hands in broken shelves in the midst of high grass, enjoying the unexpected warm spring day; they were both scatteredly connected to the cheap console, which provided the country with calming music and calm news, when, after looking at its crossed brown feet, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black performer whom his father liked to listen by throwing curtains in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their aggressive nature, songs of this type were no longer lost on console.
They were not prohibited -- nothing was really prohibited -- just not lost anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the very word "archaic."
Public taste had done things that would never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and just as people had chosen the memoirs of rich people growing up in poverty, cooking books and love novels, they had chosen ballads from all the music.
As a result of this day, Kever began to play on the imaginary piano and with a rough comical voice to sing Eilinn's big legs.
Eileenn didn't understand.
"It was a popular jazz pianist song called Fats Waller," he said to her, mechanically attaching two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she flew off his lips.
It started with a game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J," forgetting to put two fingers on your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz didn't play either, although it was not explicitly prohibited.
Improvisation's out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the tune began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with wit.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a wit expressed with music.
Although he had reached the age of 10 without ever hearing of Sammy Davis Jr., Kever knew about the jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Aileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, which meant that each segment of it accepted the gratitude -- the gratitude of those saved by fate -- for the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean descent, temperament and physical characteristics, were well suited for entertainment and sport, and they sang and ran.
The people from India, as if they were naturally talented in everything about electronics, took it upon themselves that no family would be left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish Diaspora was doing plumbing; what was left of the Greek was beating plates.
The people from the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, when, WHY ABOUT EVERYBODY HAS happened, in fear that they would be accused of inflaming the flames, in fear, that the flame would swallow them next, open restaurants with labynes and swamps, and remain standing still and bored with nothing.
To each of them by their abilities.
Since she had previously heard only ballads, it was difficult to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could at all be placed on music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," said Kever.
Unless maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anybody, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him an illusion of security.
No word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant leaves that look like cabbage.
Eileen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to press his lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head untrustedly, shutting down the view of Cavern.
There was nothing in the whole world but a copy of her hair-black.
Nothing he would like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying in her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big a leg?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Ankles, maybe a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"I like you precisely because you have fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverted.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often made him uncomfortable because, like his father, he did not need the comforting charm that might ease the violence caused by the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be violent.
Maybe, and he, Kever, wanted to.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and rose from the shed, throwing over the console and pouring out the wine they had been drinking.
Buzz wine, so drunkenness couldn't justify it.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you precisely because you have a stupid head," she said...
I don't like it, though.
He felt sorry for her and for the unnecessary rudeness of his words, and for the fear which appeared in her eyes when she stood up to him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She did not talk to him about living in the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in the main, she looked like this.
The same huge ice ocean fell on both of them.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and preposterous after what happened, were wandering in fury from the pub to the pub, ready to raise their hand against any woman who dared to refuse or tease them.
Dumb head?
They would have shown her a stupid fist if she hadn't been careful!
First a kiss -- now a kiss is the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballad that the console gave -- first kiss her and then hit her.
The extra explanation, according to Kevern, was because kissing itself was already a hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons' building showed that he needed to go.
He got up out of the shed, like an old man.
She herself felt a lead burden, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him walk away, and from the top window she watched him walk away, her companion--a man who himself bore the burden.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and for men at all, though some of them raised their hand on her.
A man who turned away from her, with his back bent, ashamed, beaten, all the ability to fight had left him--why did she feel that she knew it so well if she could not remember any case until today when she would see it?
Again, one Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above or so on, Esme Nussbau, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at the Offnau, the informal public mood control service, had prepared a small report on the maintenance of low and average levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decrease if it did not stop at all, given the means and forces which had been allocated to its elimination.
"A great deal has been done, and much is being done," she wrote, "to ease the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in the thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these misguided branches and narrow splinters of the area, where, despite the shrieking over the fences of churches, the tender breath of human kindness has seldom been felt throughout history.
However, some qualities have proved to be inexorable.
The higher the spire, it seems, the lower the passions it generates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows up stories of overcome obstacles and announces its passionate belief in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the old rudeness maintain its strong grip both in rural communities and in urban communities, but there is also evidence that new and angry violence is taking place in homes, workplaces, on roads and even on playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate habit of writing too much," said her research director, reading the entire report.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped her head.
I should also ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme insisted again on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I'm asking," finally said Luther Rabbiitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have any prejudices here.
We are the servants of society without prejudice.
But some sorts of hypersensitivity, perfectly appropriate and admirable in themselves, can sometimes distort results, like what you have shown me.
Obviously, you yourself are biased against the church, and what you call "abhorrent" and "gross" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to be bored about what was happening when it happened, as if it had happened, if ever yesterday, to rob the country of the life it needed.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabbititz was talking.
Behind his head, pink letters, like flamingo, echoed the advice that Offnau had given the country for the last quarter century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, value your wife, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, the word of a song is better than a written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you're trying to say," replied Esme Nussbaum quietly when she made sure that her research director had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything but that we haven't recovered as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I am concerned that, if we are not ready, we will find that we repeat the mistakes which have originally led to what has happened, if the whole world has gone through.
Only this time will we throw away our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabbiitz combined his fingertips into a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean infinite patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling "mistakes" actions that our grandfathers have committed or have not done.
You go too far when you talk about them throwing their anger and their mistrust on "the other."
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that when we understand the past, that is, by protecting the present, we don't talk about "us" or "they."
There was no "us" and there was no "other."
It was a time of disorder -- that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with itself," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself properly.
I don't blame anybody.
Whether it was bad or good--what's done is done.
It was then.
You don't have to say anything else, we agree here.
And as no blame should be given, you must not justify it if it was appropriate or if there was something you could fix.
But why the past, if not to learn--
Past existences to make us forget it.
If I can add one word to that--
Luther Rabbiitz's pyramid fell apart.
"I'll consider your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove on the pavement, as the passers-by described, "in angry rage."
Coincidence happens.
The Lesotho army states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The Lesotho army denied that it had prepared a coup to overthrow the Government, arguing that it had acted against a policeman suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane left the country, claiming that the army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in Maseru.
The premier took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming to have received a threat of attempted death.
The army spokesperson, Major Ntlele Ntoy, said that there was actually no coup, but that the army was responding to a threat from the "politic fanatics" whom the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning was that the Lesotho military command took action by receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements among the police that were really planning to arm some political, young fanatics who were willing to create chaos," he reported to the American Voice.
A South African government spokesperson, Clayson Monjela, said that the army's actions looked like a coup.
“Although no one has claimed to take power by force, according to all reports, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces to date have the main signs of a coup,” he said.
The Lesotho army reported that the soldiers had returned to the Barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Under-Prime Minister Mottejoa Metsing runs the government in the absence of Tabana.
Thabane stated that he believed that he was under attack in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabana suspended the parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his united Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government, despite the charges to the contrary.
Marco van Ginkel, the Chelsey quarterback, will be holding the coming season on a lease in Milana, reports Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy within hours for a medical examination.
Last season he only went to the London Club field three times.
Let's remind you that previously, Milon had rented from the Liverpool of the attacker, Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest in 13 months
Growth in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to popular research.
The last value of the eurozone production index (PMI) on Markit fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and businesses were affected by the growing strain between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values came before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets will be waiting for the bank to make a clear plan to cope with the halt in the eurozone's recovery, as well as the risk of deflation in inflation of only 0.3%.
It is assumed that ECB leader Mario Draghi may later this week give additional signals that he is considering a quantitative relaxation scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than any growth at all, the stopping effect of growing economic and geopolitic uncertainty on the producers becomes more apparent," said Rob Dobson, senior economist Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI dropped to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of real concern, as does Italy's weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
Mr. Dobson said that the signs that the momentum of growth has faded mainly in the industrial engine, Germany, and in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence.
Industrial slowdown is likely to further fuel analysts waiting for additional monetary or fiscal incentive.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, the main IHS Global Insight economist, said, "The best thing to say about the August business index study of the eurozone production sector is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The eurozone developers seem to find life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geo-politic strain, particularly in connection with Russia/Ukrainian, adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension seems to have hit the business -- and especially the confidence of consumers -- and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said "more and more like it," that the ECB would, of course, have to do some sort of quantitative relief, "although we suspect it will be limited."
The inhabitants of Mariopole will stand a chain of lives against the militia
In Mariupol until last week, everything was quiet -- no one was trying to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the inhabitants are horrifyingly waiting for the soldiers to come.
According to the polytologists, the separatists are breaking into Mariupol to get to the Sea of Azov -- a recent town called Novoasovsk, which had not previously been part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Marihuanas decided that the Ukrainian army would defend them, although it would defend them, but it had a little force against the highly armed members of the NPD-LDC, and they were going to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and build strongholds.
On Saturday evening, several thousands of people came to the eastern border of the city, and they stood there in a living chain singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same in case of an attack.
The volunteers collect and transport equipment and food, collect drugs, publish a newspaper.
The city is gradually shutting down shops and shutting down banks and ATMs.
Ten years of hell for survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the dreadful grip of school, as children who have been in it still suffer
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen soldiers at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day trial, which shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during the violence at school.
Exactly ten years after the terrible takeover of the Neslan school, during which 334 people, including 186 children, died, heroically survivors of the disaster were warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When the terrorist, Islamic fanatics, seized and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed something of the utmost possible evil.
The tragedy combined the East and the West in a disgust, which in an amazing way then turned into action and hope for the future in the worst of grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had deceived death during the violence at school.
We have discovered amazing young people who have stood up to the troubles, though the memories of the terror hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now plagues Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
The girl in the picture is trying to get back into the shelled sports hall.
It was photographed by a famous Russian photographer, Dmitry Belyakov, when in one underwear he tried to climb back into the shelled sports hall after the explosion of the mine.
In confusion, Hades desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that they both died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as possible, but I couldn't," said Hades.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and I went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few pieces remained in my knee.
Her goal now is to be a dentist, to help people the way the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly did not break it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who's left.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it any other day.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend who was supposed to be my classmate, Dr. Gapoev was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about family later.
She says the capture stays with her, though the memories are a little dull every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our misfortunes, and we are so grateful for the help that we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I walk into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure that it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through a hail of bullets, thought his mother was dead
It was his first day in school (the Russians begin school at the age of 7) and survived three days of capture, hugging their mother, Tamar.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mother told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and along the way saw the baby crying, grabbed the baby by the hand and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara got out and was in the hospital with wounds on her feet, in turn thinking her son was dead.
After their reunion she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent newspaper, News of the World), where he was rewarded as the Protector of Children from Barnardo's premier Tony Blair and his wife Shery.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you that I have a faint memory of it.
I remember right after that I threw out all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer games with the shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think of myself.
I remember the kids I was playing with in the yard that never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We say they're staying in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy shop where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted and to drive in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine where wars lead to the grief that he and his friends have endured.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who last week worked volunteering at a women's monastery.
I'm so willing to help.
I want to be a police officer someday, and I hope I'm enrolled in the Academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence right after the capture, just there were no kids who would scream and run around, and that silence had lasted for months.
She remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, help us.
She was grateful to "Sheri Blair and her foundation for that reward and opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Cherie and just tell her myself that it's 10 years ago, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat a boursch, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I keep thinking this world hasn't been better in 10 years.
Now there's a war going on in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of kids have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people war is a news story they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy; he was neither aggressive nor angry at all.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not focused on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six of their classmates, and they go to the gym every now and then and then and they light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered it--I remember him lying on the couch, turning his back on us for hours.
No sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys, and he's 17 now, he's taller than me, handsome, smart, and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around, and I saw the hell around me, when parts of the bodies were lying around.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run, run," but again I was so sure he couldn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
George Illin, 17
A boy whose shocking post-capture photograph became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Farewell: Surviving Beslan George Illin with his mother Fatima after capture in 2004 and right George today
His bloody face had a glimpse of fear when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His 54-year-old mother, Fatima, was the principal doctor, and took him to school on the first day of school before taking Vladimir's eldest son to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she remembered.
Not exactly alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some of the scenes of these days are always in front of me.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The picture of Georgie (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in a squirrel (right)
I remember that George wanted to go to school that day, that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of crying Georgia in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this picture makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says now, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever find out the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never find out the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants to war because it happens?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need to spend decades to forget her a little.
It has affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares because of the capture, but now I'm feeling better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was really scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym every 1 September.
I want to pay a tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to the University of Medicine in Vladikavkaz.
I'll learn to be a cardio surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be military, but my health prevented me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not going to happen.
George Farniev, 20
A boy who survived even though he was at the feet of a murderer.
Amazing: George Farniev was at the feet of a murderer during the capture, but he managed to survive.
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderer.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," said George, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but could not because of the damage to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are easy to deal with bad things -- I have to say, that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with therapists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the following year, it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I fainted.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: George Farniev today with an open laptop photograph of himself in the hospital after the capture
My pain is immense, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that's been damaged, but I'm walking right now.
But health still prevented me from going to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent out my papers, including my medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the Veterinary Institute.
I've been there for two years.
He's learning to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I'll never tell my kids about my experiences.
That's not what kids should know, and of course it's not what they should be going through.
His mother, Marina, 42 years old, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when my anniversary comes.
I will go and attend the ceremony which will be held to celebrate it.
I know George won't go.
For him, she must be even stronger because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me, and here in Beslan lies a fingerprint on everyone.
He stays with us.
George's a grown-up, but he's still having this nightmare.
It's hard to accept when something so awfully unjust happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had a few operations, he can walk, but he can't sport.
I'd say he's 50 percent overwhelmed this nightmare, but you can't completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and it only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and loved.
My son is with me, and it's the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw it in the hospital.
Now I'm looking at what's happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them away, as far as you can.
Alona Tskaeva, 10 years old
A child who was moved to a secure place by a special forces fighter
Saved: Alena Zkaewu is being transported to a secure location by a Russian special forces soldier (left).
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember a monstrous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alena carried out a Russian policeman from a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but violently left her 30-year-old mother, her ten-year-old sister, Christina, and her brother Mahar in the high school sports hall.
Mahar, who was then three years old, escaped, but Alenina's mother and sister died in a deadly carnage.
Her father, Ruslan, had since married again, and he and his new wife, Svetlana, had a little daughter, whom he called Christina in memory of the daughter he had lost.
Alona, who is now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and blooms into a smart and cheerful little girl, says the neighbors.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alona and Mahar are both beautiful children," said a close friend.
Ruslan is a wonderful father, and he wants to keep them away from all the memories at the tenth anniversary.
You can see why.
Cinji Kagawa's half-protector, who had returned from the Manchester United to the Dormouse of Boston, said that he was eager to be able to re-enter the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous career event.
Of course, I'm very glad I'll play for "Borussia again,"--speaks the Bald words of Kagawa.
I feel really good.
It's full of positive emotions, and I look forward to being able to re-enter the field in the form of "Borussia."
Remember, Kagawa moved to the MU from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to join the English club, having spent only 38 games in the English championship in two seasons, scored six balls and gave eight performances.
A man accused of attacking a girl at the Pelican walkway in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be tried for assaulting a three-year-old girl at the Pelican walkway in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at the Pittenwin crossing in East Newk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Steward was conducting his Audi Q3 without due diligence and attention and had hit the girl, resulting in an injury.
Edward, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt in the Dundee sheriff's court.
Chief Charles McNair, the King's lawyer, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Holland won't stay in Vladivostok.
A duty-free shop at Vladivostok airport put up a sign forbidding purchases from this store by a number of world political leaders.
They'll never have any perfume, wodka, or cognac.
The department of the store decided that US President Barack Obama, US German chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francis Hollande, Vitaly Clique, Julia Tymoshenko, Japan's prime minister and several other famous companions would not be able to enjoy their shops with wodka, cognac and perfume.
And put a plaque on the door.
Earlier, Obama had been denied access to an even less accessible facility, the MGU Dietary, as reported by the General Service.
Whether the American President had ever dreamed of eating in a dietary kitchen in Russia was unknown, but the authors of bans seemed clearly extremely clever themselves.
Is there cheese after the Embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the Agraries
The Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should learn new technologies to produce the requested cheese varieties.
The Board was given during a visit to the South Pacific Company by Agrocomplex.
The head of government also gave advice to the rectors to redirect to Russian meat, the quality of which is at an appropriate level.
An annual food import ban has been introduced in Russia since 7 August.
Valentine Maslakov, the head coach of the Russian team, was pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, third place is a good result given the lack of targeted training for the competition.
Our sportsmen have spoken at their own level, saying "All sports" to Maslakov.
Third place is confirmation of our high command level.
It's nice that the French, and even the Americans, have the slightest advantage over us.
We haven't prepared for this competition.
The season ended, and we did not require our leaders to take part in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we've been second at this tournament, but this season we've been resuming our team.
The French, on the contrary, launched a capable team of 13 European champions.
They have not concealed their intention to win this year, as they have repeatedly declared publicly.
But even this kind of competition could not stand up to the Americans.
So I think the Russians have spoken to such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order below the same Brilliant League.
Season over.
Of course, sports don't matter much anymore, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And as a result, I agree it's absurd that at 1,500 meters men were so passionate about the tactical tactics of the run that they showed the results below the average of the... women's races.
4 hints on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or film videos underwater, you have a range of hardware options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a watertight "silver," for example, Nikon Kolpix AW120, or an operating camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these photos at the family holiday with a couple of cameras, all at a price of about $350.
No matter what kind of equipment you use, there are several rules that need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment again.
Even if you have a watertight chamber, make sure that the cell battery and other compartments are closed tightly.
Also, set up your camera for the kind of photos or video you are going to shoot.
Some photos and video cameras have camera modes or object type that optimize the display for darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your hardware can sink.
Some cells are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our customer's leadership and digital camera ratings for both traditional and watertight models.
Take a few shots, because many of them won't.
The "mysteries" have LCDs that will help you compile pictures, while the action cameras don't usually have them.
Even if you have LCD, it'll be hard to see underwater, and the frame layout will be a random process.
So do a few frames.
Also, if your camera has a series mode that shoots several frames with a little different display, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The amount of light decreases considerably, the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you shoot in a pool, a river, or an ocean.
This will also allow you to pass more colors on the photos; the deeper you go, the smaller the color you will see.
Float closer to the objects.
It's a great advice to shoot on land, but it's even more important underwater due to dark light conditions.
It's especially important if you film this camera: this equipment is often fitted with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you have to get close to the camera if you want to fill out the frame.
Bilal Mahov's 2012 Freewill Games armor can move into a Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by Sazeed Sajid, the main coach of the Dugestan team for the free struggle.
The specialist did not rule out the player's participation in the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Bill Mahov is currently at the "Classic" team -- quotes "R-Sport" by Sajid Sajidov.
In fact, Billal's teenagers also performed in both styles.
At the world's first youth in 2005, he became the winner of the freemen tournament and the third prizer in the Greek-Roman competition and decided to focus on the free struggle.
It's been a long time since we've talked about a new phase of our career that our heavyweight will carry out in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll tell you more, Mahov can already perform at the world championship in Tashkent, if he wins the costume.
But the decisive word is always for the coach's staff led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a person whose personal strength could shake everything up, even in a huge organization like the National Health Service.
An anaesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to riding the sick of both the suffering of the disease and the suffering of the cure.
Among those who spoke to him his wife remembered was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors are interested in diagnosis and disease, those who are receiving treatment are mostly concerned about something quite different -- pain.
Once in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
In his struggle with symptoms like the flu, he found that he was irritatingly reproaching his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster than later," he remarked.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found out that he was unusual and unimaginable why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to X-ray the chest.
Only two weeks earlier he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The X-ray results have arrived.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects a mold, or a pulmonary shell.
For most cancers, it's hard to find out exactly why.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all people with lung cancer have smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbest, fibrous building material, which was once called "a miracle," but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that you can ignore.
Asbestos, after all, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbest has not been used in the United Kingdom since the 1960s, when the industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific sectors were working closely with it: pipes, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another age, it hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But this calm is wrong.
Britain is now at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
Here, mesothelioma kills more people than any other country on the planet.
At an annual death rate of about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die of this disease as from car accidents.
Annual mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we feel its deadly effects now is that, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually prohibited by law in 1999, the development of mesothelioma usually takes decades.
And the attack by a mesothelioma is not confined to the professions of industrial construction.
Asbest was, and in many cases remains, placed in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we shop.
As a result, mesothelioma ignores class, wealth, profession, or age.
The Bastions of Choice, from fancy London stores to private schools, have not been saved.
Parliament's building is covered with asbest.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have proved to be the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a chimney insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with the asbest.
Then he figured it out.
"It seems that there might have been a lot of asbest in the tunnel at Guy's hospital, where I spent six years on internship," he wrote.
Everyone -- students, nurses, doctors and transporters -- used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question to which unfortunately he could give a partial answer.
"of the four doctors who had been interned at Gaius hospital and who had subsequently developed a mesothelioma over the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010 "I'm the only one who's survived."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with a mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55 years old.
It's unusual to live so long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat the question of Lawson, "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to professor Julian Pito, a leading mesothelioma expert in the United Kingdom, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic in the United Kingdom is expected to survive, about 900,000 people will die.
Most people don't think they're going to die like that.
Asbest mines in Quebec, Canada
A quick look at reports from court rooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they had mishandled Janice Ellen with asbest.
She worked online for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, directing dress divisions at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she began working for M&S.
She has two children over the age of 20.
"Before it happened," she said, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I hardly knew of asbest.
It never occurred to me that it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbest.
In fact, asbest is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They have their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a fibrous structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler sutures, even in the stopping pads of cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that could cause death.
However, brown ash (amosite) and blue ash (crokidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbest, and experts suggest that "there are strong, though indirect, reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of mesothelioma patients [in the United Kingdom]".

Janice Ellen may not have thought of himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Pito suggests that her history is far from unusual.
He carried out a study of the sick, which suggests that “a substantial percentage of mesotheli, when there is no known effect on the work or the home, was likely to be caused by the effects of asbest from the environment”.
Most of this effect, he says, is due to the "usual use and effects of weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, showed how people, even at the very heart of government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines behind the parliamentary committee premises had been polluted with ash, the deadly fiber of which could be brought into motion by something as harmless as “severe air streams”.
Parliamentarians are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems true.
While the Parliament's Technical Services Department insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “clean health certificate”, it now recognized that it was necessary to work for £1 billion in the reconstruction of Parliament by improving the electricity and removing the ash, and that, after the general elections of 2015, members of Parliament might meet at the QE2 conference centre nearby rather than at the Westminster Greenbeds.
The Goddard report stated that “the situation with asbest was not managed according to various rules”.
It is not possible to know whether this management error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to detect their contact with asbest is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, he suspected that he had been exposed to asbest while working in hospitals.
"I worked at the hospital, which was successfully sued for asbest," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was struck by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45 years old, and he was in the middle of an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I started to get feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from a mold, a shell around his lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
After all, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Astonished doctors took x-rays of the chest and put in a polyderic catheter to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it to the tests.
Still, his condition remained undiagnosed.
His health gradually improved and he returned to work.
But occasionally the same symptoms were returned, often after he was engaged in sports and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients went to the reception room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with a mesothelioma.
However, even then Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was tens of years older and worked directly with the asbest.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition eroded again, and the doctor consulting him showed his C.T. results and X-rays to a team of professionals.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a camera-enabled sensor was introduced into a cavity between the shell of his chest and the shell of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just go on," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year's, "I've been told it's a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed by mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott went into meetings with the Macmillan nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbest has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was quite often thermo-insulation on pipes," he said.
People who have been exposed to asbest in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
So the mesothelioma now affects younger people with unusual occupations.
The most dangerous insulated pipes in hospitals were in the cellars, so it is unlikely that patients will be affected.
But many of the officers who walked through the pedestrian tunnel to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the dining-rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to a poisonous substance.
For decades after the war, it turns out that the hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for the inhabitants, but a place that threatened the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolmates placed their Bunsen burners on the asbestos cushions
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestus was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its remarkable isolation and fire resistance.
Schools too.
In fact, many were probably first exposed to asbest in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry lessons, students placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos.
Websites have emerged that highlight the problem of asbest in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roofs of sheds generally contained asbest.
"It's an industrial poison embedded in a great deal of our buildings," remarked Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the destruction of the garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful with the garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
"It takes quite a while to realize it," said Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to go and deal with myself.
Well, I won't see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how puzzled he was by the amount of information to be accepted.
"It was hard to understand everything," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I've been given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it is the mechanic of how we sustain life -- the very act of breathing -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When the ash breaks down and the fibers inhale, they can be stuck in a mold, a pulmonary shell.
Asbestos fibers irritate the mold and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is the inhalation of needles of asbestos fibers," by Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothorax surgeon who came to Guy's hospital in 2001.
It's the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbest, which, ironically, is now leading a mesothelioma treatment center.
The coach knew Lawson and treated some of the others who were probably exposed to internships at the hospital.
When the needles of the asbestos fall into the tissue of the lungs, says Treather, "by breathing them out into the periphery where the shell is located.
This is essentially an invasive process from the beginning.
Normal options for treating other forms of cancer are much less effective for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, has caused hot arguments.
Some feel it's worth a try.
The coach disagrees.
"It's impossible to cut the mold," he said.
It's impossible to get around her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer "is not very good at chemo," which "acts," but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are sick people who live long," said Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
The writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis was made.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, had become a single support and counseling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Rocky Central," he said joyfully when they called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six rounds of chemo, which would take four months and would only extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson did, however, "became to give things a little more positive colouring."
After meeting several experts, Abbott decided to continue the treatment with Professor Loic Lung-Lazdunski, a professor of thoracic surgery at Gaius hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," admits Graham.
The average patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a decisive role for mesothelioma patients in order to obtain the best available treatment.
However, when such treatment finally proves to be inefficient, many patients face another financial reason for concern about the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It was known that ash has been dangerous to health since 1898," said Morgan.
But what's changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small amounts could risk health.
That's when the company's bad faith came up.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a "full value settlement," according to Morgan, because Lawson could not prove clearly that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbest in Guy's hospital.
After an investigation of his death, the representative of the Gaius hospital confirmed, however, that “the bench in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, tying deadly contact with asbest to one company or place of work -- usually decades later -- proved to be a great problem for mesothelioma patients.
Many of their former employers had changed ownership or closed down.
The insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against suits know that they have no time on their side, of course.
In response this year, serious new legislation emerged that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients to collect compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a £350 million fund financed by the insurance industry has been set up for those who have been diagnosed since July 2012 and who can prove contact but who have no one to prosecute.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the sum that the court could have ordered in the ordinary compensation case, about £1200.
About 300 successful suits under this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, as many people who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by the insurers for the insurers," he says, insinuating that the sum is a quarter of what the insurers would have had to pay if the temporary period had not interfered and the mesothelioma patients would have been able to trace the companies and file a claim in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly the Minister of Labor and Pensions, has recognized that the law is "implemented."
However, both Penning and Morgan recognize that while seven people die every day, a quick action was needed.
"People suffer so much, and need help today," said Penning during the second reading of the Bill of Mesothelioma last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lung-Laudunski for 19 months.
After initial consultation, Lung-Ludunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This was followed by radio and chemo therapy, a tri-therapy in which Lung-Lazdunski can boast of 40 percent of the survivors in five years.
Abbott felt a wave of strength.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," said Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some power that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six rounds of chemo.
The following scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots in my chest.
I was about to turn 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And then Abbott went through six cycles of chemo.
Now there's no sign of a tumour.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things -- finances, when I die, for example, or showing my wife how a timer works on a boiler.
When you get bad news, you get sad.
You have to look forward.
As Ally's father, 16 years old, and Tamsin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he said.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
The first time I was diagnosed, I told the girls I had a disease that means I'm not going to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and a lot of people called us very soon.
Ally was more restrained.
She didn't talk much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by a glimpse of the possibility of survival.
This disease carries with it (even after all to Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of embalmed pawns are wrapped in asbestos.
Asbestos fibers are used to improve the pot and heat resistance.
Pliny the Sr. describes as an asbest.
Now a canvas that doesn't ignite has been invented.
I've seen his napkins melt in fireplaces on banquets.
The modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even notes) and tissues.
Large asbest mines are being opened in Canada and South Africa and soon afterwards in America, Italy and Russia.
It's the perfect heat insulator for steam engines and industrial revolution turbines.
Global production of asbestos is rising to over 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics from Predential detect early mortality among those who work with asbest and who are therefore denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke shows that the particles of asbest in her lungs were "unquestionably the main cause of death."
This is the first case of this type.
Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
No compensation paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding, one of the most deadly professions in terms of contact with asbest, has been on the rise.
Free industrial ban on the import of blue asbest
The Court of Appeal confirmed the first successful health action caused by contact with asbestos in the United Kingdom.
Global production of asbestos has grown to more than 4213 000 tons per year.
Britain imports 133,000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in the United Kingdom requires that all vendors working with asbest be granted a licence.
Import and use of blue and brown asbest are prohibited by law in Britain.
All use of asbest is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act was passed in the United Kingdom.
A compensation scheme of £350 million has been declared.
Asbestos is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but white asbest is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear revenge
The Chinese Parliament had decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to stand for election in the year 2017, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to start a long-proclaimed protest in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began planning and mobilising within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the All-China People's Congress basically allows the Communal leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It did not deceive our expectations, but it still angered us," said the lawmaker Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's people.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
In defending China's decision, Lee Fey, the deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing the popular election of Hong Kong's leader would be too "hootic."
Since 1997 when the UK handed over control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants of the region to vote for a head of government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders had presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward, as it gave the Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also made it clear that Chinese leaders would continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a commission to nominate candidates closely monitored from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision was made after the summer, when some of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong took place over the years.
Behind a large part of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers threatened to shut down Hong Kong's financial region unless Beijing guaranteed a true universal right to vote.
On Sunday evening, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central activists gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, the organisers stated that their movement was moving towards a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organisers reported that the movement "considered the possibility of taking over the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that could only be taken if all opportunities for dialogue were exhausted and there was no other option.
It is with great regret that we report that, to date, every opportunity for dialogue has been exhausted and that the occupation of the central region will certainly take place.
The government in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing's statement for a few days, and on Sunday security measures had been enhanced at government headquarters with the police and the barricade.
At the root of the unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The flow of inhabitants from the mainland increases competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put Hong Kong's business power at risk.
"The protest they're talking about can cause a great deal of economic damage depending on how much people will be involved and how long," said the lawgiver Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want the worry that Hong Kong is getting out of hand.
It's an idea that's bad for investment.
Chinese government media have also reported in recent days, in which Hong Kong democratic activists have been shown by agents sent by Western powers.
This summer activists organized an informal referendum on voting law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American prom culture reaches university life: freshmen are offered to come on a private jet
We are happy to respond to such a demand by launching the first UK lux travel service for current students.
To give a bright impression of coming to university, the company also offers transport options such as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McClaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service was thinking about safety.
This service is the perfect alternative for students who usually have to carry their stuff across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping students this year get to university with the least effort and maximum luxury.
The representative of the company said that, since the service had just been started, the orders had not yet been received, but added that “students will start ordering the service in the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that although students needed to pay £90,000 a year for their studies, it still hoped to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Student Union criticized this service as being disconnected from reality.
Meghan Dunn, the NSS Vice President for Higher Education, said, "This project seems incredibly distracted from the lives of most students.
Many of the students who will start university this month are experiencing a cost-of-living crisis, when available financial support in the form of credit and subsidies is unable to meet the rapidly growing costs of basic needs before they can even begin to think about taking thousands of pounds out of some sort of simple arrival in the dormitory.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
An armed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come up raise their hands and say, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, about the murder of an armed teenager named Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who had left comments placed the gender above race when it came to advancing reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as the tension in the Middle East grew and national attention was drawn, Perez saw the responses of white women, who focused on 100 per cent of their race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of August 9, a personal essay with such headlines as "the thought of Ferguson on behalf of a white woman" and "Peminism is not just about oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people talking about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic for the crisis that we're experiencing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so race-based, they felt they needed to point it out.
For a professor of English at the University of Ohio, Mitchell Ferguson discovered the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner, and get 150 liquor from everywhere," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are attacked in their own country, silence is overwhelmed.
"Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships but not about public safety?" she asked.
For black women, like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sex in US history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share these problems; they faced a difficult reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in feminist mainstream, Angel Hattery, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their previous women were doing the opposite.
"Till 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, almost always based on the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
It took a white woman to prove the story to justify lynching.
From Hatteri's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white surrogates, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and found that the struggle for voting rights would only work for one of the groups: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in a basket of women's voting rights, and the voice for blacks was to appear later," said Hattery.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear idea why colored women don't trust white women.
We haven't done anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women achieved voting rights in 1920, it took 10 years for white women to unite against the lynchings of the Association of South Women for preventing lynchings.
This group came about almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
From the point of view of Mitchell, the rise of white feminists' reactions to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson -- police behaviour, racial discrimination -- reflects a time when white feminists have had to deal with the problems that black women have had to deal with in several generations.
"Really, it would be great if activists with such [traditional feminist] ideology took the right to raise a child as seriously as they treated the right to prevent it?" asked Mitchell.
The second wave feminists, who have made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to birth control, are beginning to understand what that means.
A famous white activist of the Floria Stainem feminist movement, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, used Facebook and published a sharp article by a Colombian guardian Rebecca Carroll who demanded that white Americans take more part in racist protests.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger of the body -- and the views on the race problems that vary considerably in public opinion polls -- will be at the top of change," wrote Steinem.
Although Stainem is vouchsafed for a more intersecting feminism that includes both race and gender issues, its comments on race in America are still surprising to some.
Researcher Kristina Somers of the American Institute of Business, author of "Who stole Feminism?", said She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, were "more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contradicted the criticism she had previously expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, "The Watcher of my brother" to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, a violent reaction from many feminist women, including Gloria Steinem, followed.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that promotes traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested about 63,000 minors without escort on the south-west border this year, immigration reform came back to the surface -- this time, as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilised women to support immigration reform, said that in order to present the problem as important to women, she only needed to share the stories of women immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of workers are granted [male immigrants], women who come with them are placed in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are responding to women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich's pig house is for sale.
The photograph of the house put on sale in Suffolk was removed by the real estate agents when it turned out to be a large pig resting in the living room.
It's put on sale for £120000, and a separate house with one bedroom stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was a photograph of the living room of the house -- a picture of a pig with a head lying on the couch.
The Connels Real Estate Authority reported that the pig in the photograph is the homeowner's favorite.
"However, the photograph was uploaded erroneously and has already been deleted," said the company's representative.
In a detailed description of the house, Connels described the former assembly house as "unique separate house with one bedroom."
Despite the fact that the agency removed the photograph from its website, it is still in advertisements.
The sale of the house generated interest in social media, where some asked if the pig was sold with the house.
The Russian tennis player, Mary Sharapova, in the fourth round of US Open, who joined Caroline Wozniatski, thinks she lacks stability.
According to the sports woman, she wants to finish the year properly and try to get to a new level, handing out Basil OSYPOV from New York.
How do you generally rate your results at the Big Hatter tournaments this year?
Of course I'm glad I won the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I did not have enough stability, especially at the end of some games.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't even get to the quarterfinals.
What are your tasks before the end of the season?
After the unfortunate defeat, I have a huge motivation to go to a new level.
I've got something to work on, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year with dignity.
The Asian series of tournaments starts in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Committee on Physical Culture, Sport and Young People, former World Champion Nikolai Valuev, suggested that the GTO be given a bonus when entering university.
He said that generally the norm would be the same as in Soviet times -- people would pass the norm by pull, run, and other exercises.
Recall that the 12 Russian entities will begin to implement GTO standards on their territory on 1 September.
I also offered high school students who had passed the GTO to give their university entrance bonuses, said Valuev.
For example, you can add a little points to the EEG.
There are also suggestions to give an additional holiday to the employees of the industry who have passed the sports tests.
There's a new millionaire in the city of harvey in South Wales after winning the lottery.
He's a lottery player from Harvey this month.
A search is under way for a new millionaire southwest of Perth, where one lucky fellow will take home almost $1.1 million from a Saturday night lottery game.
The newsstand in Harvey brings gold to the top prize for the second time in five years, and the last win was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to make a statement.
The owner of the store, Steve Forward, said that the winnings caused a gig in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole town is talking about it, and everybody's very excited.
We thought that such a win might be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated winning the prize last month, marking the end of a few successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a Canning Vale player became one of the five millionaires in August, following a huge $7.5 million win from Belmont just a few weeks before.
The winning couple had been playing for 20 years and reported that winning had given them an opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mino-eco-development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce an integrated plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, and has presented the Vice-Director of the Department of the Ministry of the Environment, Oleg Pluijnik, at a round table, which held the "Reports" on the Moscow Road Show, 2014.
The plan was designed on behalf of the Government and one of the main goals was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted at the end of September - early October, says Plownikov, the proposed measures relate to electric cars and hybrids - a road map for the development of gas-powered vehicles in Russia is already in place.
The plan (with a copy of the report) is intended for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport need to be developed and how to encourage the use and production of clean vehicles.
A report to the Government describing tax and Customs support measures for electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a scheme of favourable credit and favourable leases will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce car prices, stimulate localization and build service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014 - 2015, changes are expected to be made to the regulations to ease the conditions for the construction of the charging infrastructure (in parking, filling stations etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to make suggestions to the regional authorities during the course of 2015, that they also encourage the use of clean transport, in the form of an advantage in driving and parking, for example, and by February 2016, and a proposal to expand public purchases of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014 the Ministry of Economic Development will add criteria to the list of performance indicators for the regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of clean transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric cars in Russia is still in the form of some 100 electric cars sold throughout the country in 2013.
In early 2014 an import duty for electric cars was lifted, so sales will be about 500 grand, predicted by the Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Punkov.
But five-fold growth does not make electric cars noticeable: in the Russian Federation, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold, according to the European Business Association.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors has imported electric cars into Russia.
Renault is preparing to import, a company that focuses on corporate clients, says the director of Renault's strategic planning and partnerships in Russia, Nicolas Remiz.
Most of the other electric transport industry has taken a wait-and-see position with regard to Russia.
There are also Russian electric car developers -- "," GAZ, "" but the output is small.
For example, in January and July 2014 ASM Holding reported that AutoVAC had released 30 electric cars.
The demand is low because of the expensive electric car, admits the Director of AutoVaza for the engineering of Sergei Amanov, there will be no breakthrough in this segment without control....
The development of the Russian electric car market, in addition to the expensive cars (the electric cars sold in Russia, on average twice as expensive as internal combustion engines) prevents the underdevelopment of the charging infrastructure (compensation-unit) and is being sighed by the president of the Autostat by Sergei Celtov.
Due to the high cost and low rate of cost cuts, electric cars will remain a low segment of the Russian market in the next three or four years, predicted by the editor-in-chief of the "Autorevo" by Mikhail Podrojanski; he accepts it.
On the contrary, automakers say that some models of electric cars are already close to the value of normal cars.
The Russian market for electric cars has good prospects, and the main thing is to build confidence in consumers that “electronicity” is real; this will be enhanced by the emergence of more charging stations, particularly by the President of the BMW group in Russia, Wolfgang Shlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented by, for example, the Rosseti State Company: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon be available.
Discussions are under way with other regions on the construction of a fuel network.
According to the Director of the Rossete Department, Vladimir Sofyin, the company believes in the market for electric cars and is ready to build gas stations all over the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of various brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a network company, is not allowed to sell electricity, and the possibility of charging electric cars is being explored.
Punkov considers it the most effective measure to control the creation of a market for electric cars to clear Customs duties in Russia.
The zero rate will remain in effect until the end of 2014 and consideration is being given to extending it, extending the grace list.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and concerns all machines) will also support the market, but not as strong as the Customs preferences are considered by Punks.
Transport taxes are small in Russia, says Punkov, unlike Norway, for example, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sales of electric cars, accounting for 12% of the market.
Russia also needs incentive measures for car owners, such as free parking in the centre of the city (as already done in Moscow), confidence in Punks, or the possibility of moving electric cars along marked lanes, which Russia does not yet have.
A private plane crashed in Colorado
Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado, America.
Three of the five people in it died, handing over ITAR-TASS.
The survivors have been taken to the hospital.
The crash occurred a few miles from the Denver airport runway.
The causes of the tragedy are now being determined.
In Donetsk oblast, they deal with the captured soldiers of the Donbas Battalion.
The defendants were surrounded by Ilowayk.
They were betrayed by their own commanding officers, and dozens of soldiers died under fire.
The survivors say that if they knew what the actual situation in south-east Ukraine was, they would not go to war.
One hundred and twenty-eight prisoners are lucky.
The Donbass Battalion's punishments were left alive after the "mesh-storm" they were hit by under Iloway.
In an army surrounded by the Donetsk People's Republic, the combatants spent a few days, actually abandoned by their commanding officers and the Ukrainian authorities.
When the staff reported that the ring could be removed from the alleged corridor, the column moved.
But just a few minutes later, bullets and bullets hung from all sides.
"On the basis of the information I was given, we had a corridor, and we were allowed to go out," he says, "and the deputy commandant of the battalion, who has the name "Lermontov."
And when we went down from Polypole to Rednosell, there was a crossfire with anti-tank guided rockets, with "jumps," rocket launchers with 30-millimeter, automatic BMD cannons, small arms.
There were four cars and three cars in front of me, and there were only two cars left.
An officer named "Lermontov" said that almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were wounded, and many died later.
The survivors are now being treated by those they come to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "Terrorist" treats them well, giving them food, medicine.
While their own officers actually deceived them and condemned them to the right death.
We've just been betrayed, they say.
The column, the entire battalion, to be destroyed.
At the Donbass Battalion, like many of his companions, Alexei volunteered because in the Ukrainian news there was a report of the abuses allegedly committed by the "separatists" in the south-east.
This is where Alexei saw a different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, not by anybody, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was a mortar attack going on, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces," said one of the soldiers, Alexei.
After that, I wanted to quit the battalion.
They wouldn't let us out of Ilowaysk, they said we were in a ring.
I've already arranged with the commanding officer, and the report has already been written about leaving.
We were immediately taken to Ilowaysk from our collections with Zurahov.
According to the prisoners, there's a 300-350 man trapped in a cottage under Iloway.
Some survivors now admit that if the time could be reversed, they would never have joined the punishment battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over by the FDN.
Everyone will be tested for war crimes.
A food price control centre has been set up in the region
In Krasnoyar Province, a central office has been set up to limit the price of products in the region if necessary.
The decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
Members of the Government of the Province, representatives of the executive branch and the monitoring agencies were part of the staff.
Together, they'll monitor the prices of farm products in the countryside.
- Will Kiev's Rosnefti pay $140 million in damages?
The head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, said that the company estimated the damage caused by the shelling of the Lisian NPP in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damages of $140 million and we're going to talk to the Ukrainian government about the payment of compensation," said Sechin.
He said that the upgrade of the Lisician NPP was planned in 2014.
However, part of the factory was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fighting, there were no digging up rebels," but Ukrainian shelling destroyed part of the industrial site.
Also, the technological oil pumped into the pipes is missing," he said.
On 18 July, the oil storage tank was burned down and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed in connection with the firing of the Lisician NPP.
The Lisician NPP is the main oil processing plant in Ukraine, and the first phase of the plant was launched in October 1976.
The total capacity of the LSN is about 7 million tons per year.
The plant is capable of producing fuel from the Euro 4 standard as well as batches of the Euro 5 standard.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the LSN were suspended due to its loss.
At the plant, it was decided to start the repairs.
A year later Rosneft received the Lisician NPP, together with other Ukrainian TNCs-XB.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea launched a short-range projectile towards the Japanese Sea.
South Korean media reports that this occurred about 10:30 a.m. local time from the Province of Chagando, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
According to Interfax in the South Korean Chiefs' Joint Committee, the rocket allegedly fell into the Japanese Sea after flying about 220 km.
The robe falls against the background of geo-politic pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar grew by 3 Cops to 37.15 roubles, and the ruble dropped to a boulder basket in a context of geo-politic tension.
ETS tenders for the dollar began with transactions at 37.11-37.2 roubles/$1 in an average two-minute rate of 37.16 roubles/$1, which is 4 cops above the previous closing.
The euro rate was 48.79 roubles per euro, which is 3 Cops above the previous closing.
The price of the boulder added 3.5 cop to 42.395 roubles.
The US dollar trades 23 cops above the official rate, the euro 16 cops above the official rate.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He continued to cheapen and ruble and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Now, the investors are already presuming a decline in the geo-politic environment and possible new sanctions against Russia.
So far, however, it's more like an artificial hysteria, spread through the media, especially the Westerns.
There are not many options for imposing new sanctions on the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the ruble continues to sharply weaken against the boulder basket.
The geopolitic background remains a decisive factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative soon, both Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
Orenburg Airlines will be suing Perfect Tour.
The Orenburg Airlines have brought a total of 4.7 billion roubles to Ideal Tour.
These are two cases on which the meeting will take place in October.
There will be different judges to try.
According to Interfax, the first suit was filed on 14 August.
His sum is just over 425 million roubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 7 October.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
It's 424 billion roubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 2 October.
Journalists in the Russian Union of the Tour industry have been informed that there are different judges appointed.
In July, Ideal Tour's debt to Orenburg Airlines amounted to 1.5 billion roubles.
The director of the flight company, Victor Zukin, speaks of a sum of 1.6 billion roubles.
The president of the Aeroflot, Vitaly Savelev, calls an even larger sum, two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to be more interesting to new users
Twitter microblogs has changed the user registration process to involve new players more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
Now new Twitter users will view during registration a large number of recommended accounts to immediately form their own reading circle.
The recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests specified when registering.
Twitter automatically ticks subscriptions for all automatically selected accounts.
This means that the user will have to hand-click the ticks so he doesn't want to read those he doesn't care about.
While users of microblogs have previously seen only the recommended users' avatars, Twitter now produces a sample of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help shape the person.
This is the largest change in Twitter registration in three years.
Recently, Twitter has been active in modernizing the service.
This activity is particularly linked to the continuing efforts of the service to achieve costlessness.
In 2014 the microblog service encountered a slower growth in the user base and a decline in reader activity.
The company is now desperately in need of more of the customer's loyal resources, which would have remained for a long time.
That's the only way to ensure a steady flow of advertising tools.
A day of knowledge in Moscow will be yellow and rainy
The first September in the Moscow region will be cold and rainy all day long, reported by meteorologists.
Moscow's air temperature will be between 16 and 18 degrees, and Moscow's temperature will be between 13 and 18 degrees.
In cloudy weather-clearing places will rain, the east quarter wind will be rather weak -- just 3-8 meters per second.
Automobile management programme resumed on 1 September
Since 1 September, Russia has been resuming its car-recycling programme.
By 31 December 2014 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As explained by the Head of the Ministry of Trade of the Russian Federation, Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits which have already been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other sources of support.
The programme will affect all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation will be between 40,000 for a passenger car and 350,000 roubles for a cargo.
Earlier in Russia, a similar car management program had been in place.
The main difference of the current project, the Minister explained, is that it is now intended not only to use the machines to obtain a discount, but also to enable the car, if the car is over six years old, to acquire a new one, with a discount on the old one's trayd-in from the dealer, to send Interfax.
More than 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal disposition programme, which was in effect from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
As a result, the production rate for cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million (a plus 101% in 2009).
Designer Coming Out Simulator will launch a game on modern journalism
Game designer Nicky Keyes, famous for Coming Out Simulator, decided to launch a game on modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
The Keyes began work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact is only now well known.
The source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where protests were under way, which began after a policeman had killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has no name yet, will be the way the media coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civil journalist, will need to photograph what's happening in areas where there's a conflict between the police and the population.
A hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police look like heroes and the protesters look like thugs, the police will start treating him better and letting him go where a normal person can't go.
If he does otherwise, his photos can turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
The points in the game will need to be Twitterd by a hero who will have new subscribers, if the photos there are popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of exit and the platform on which it appears is unknown.
The case, however, published an image showing how an event might change depending on how a photograph of it was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Keyes, he explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game a long time ago, but he wanted to focus it on events in the Gaza Strip rather than protests in the United States.
After he began to collect material for the game, the game designer realized that he did not have enough knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw media coverage of events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what had happened.
Nicky Keyes is an independent developer who produces web games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which talks about events from Keyes' own biography, focuses on how a bisexual teenager tries to tell homophobic parents about his or her relationship.
Helete is dragging Ukraine into further bloodbath
By appealing to prepare for the next ten thousand victims, the Ukrainian Defence Minister, Valerius Glethey, is dragging the people into the continuation of a bloody conflict, as reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valerius Goletheus, who declared "the completion of an operation to free Ukraine from terror" and the beginning of the "Great Domestic War", in which the loss would amount to "tens of thousands".
The level of appropriateness of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the post on his Facebook page, is a subject for the study of non-combatant experts,” states in the Russian diplomatic report.
They scarcely believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "The Russian side has already threatened, through informal channels, that if resistance continues, they are willing to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
He stated, however, that the “Operation for the Release of Eastern Ukraine” had been completed.
Perez Hilton removed all intimate images of the stars and apologized.
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars have been terrorized.
The hackers hacked primitive passwords in the iCloud (Data Repository) in smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
Not for long, really.
Remember, the official representative of the Star of the Hungry Games, Jennifer Lawrence, has already reported the theft of photos from her cell phone, and has also confirmed that all photos that shine on the network are real.
Perez Hilton, the designer of a single tabloid site, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her assistants for publishing their frank images, writing The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
I haven't been contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to remove the frank picture of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justiz," wrote a Twitter blogger.
However, all frank photos of stars have already spread over the network.
David Beckham was hit by an accident, hiding from the paparazzi.
David Beckham crashed on a bike, avoiding a paparazzi.
It happened in Los Angeles at a corner on Sunset Boulevard.
The British football player had a bruise and sprained right arm muscle.
Beckham came out of the tattoo-salon where the paparazzi was waiting for him.
Slide from their pursuit on a bike, he failed in the turn of control and fell, writing TMZ with a reference to a footballer's close sources.
As a result, Beckham was hit, his right arm was stretched, and he was scratched.
Tony Stewart is crashing back on track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
He crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front bus exploded on 172 laps, ending his performance.
And then he walked out without talking to the reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that 14 team members were upset, but now they're going to focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better attempt and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we can do better there.
Edward first crashed into the wall earlier in a Sunday night race after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repair of the right side of his car.
"I started today with a rather great hope of coming to the end well," said Johnston, adding, "just failed."
Shortly after the second crash, the car was loaded on the tow truck, and the team was ready to go.
Edward skipped three NASCAR Spring Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during a race along a dirt highway in north New York.
He decided to come back this week, and he had to win either in Atlanta or next race in Richmond to take part in the prosecution.
He returned to work during an investigation into a tragic incident in which a 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. was killed, who went to the highway to express his displeasure at the time of the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the investigation of the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
No decision was made as to whether or not the charge would be brought against him.
The three-time champion was greeted with loud shouts and applause when he was presented before the race.
Started at 12th position, he went to the first 10 at the beginning of the race, getting to the fourth position.
Then on the 122th round, after Bush's restart number.
car 18 came off a trajectory at the outlet of turn 2, and crashed into Stewart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Edward went on, but he's down to position 21.
Cobczak and Vittorgan eat cigarettes with Guenetski in Odessa
Xenia Sobczak and Maxim Wittorgan are now in Odessa, which the broadcaster has not failed to report in her Instagram.
True, one photograph surprised and embarrassed the couple's fans very much.
The picture was taken from the Guinevere.
"At Michael's breakfast, the Giovanni Maxim explains what instagrams are:) #odessa," signed a photograph of Xenia Sobchak.
But there's nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no buns, no butter, etcetera...
The couple's fans thought Xyusha was smoking too, and they convicted her for it.
"And whose cigarettes?," "Smoking kills!" "What sort of cigarette breakfast?" "It's like breakfast, and on the table only cigarettes))) ", "Xenia, do you smoke too?", were excited about her favorite followers of her blog.
Remember, recently Sobczak boasted of the delicious dinner that Maxim Wittorgan had made her for the first time in her life.
"Happy is when you come to the house, and your husband prepares dinner for your visit (for the first time for married life, but it's delicious. It's important that at the end of dinner he doesn't say with the words of anecdote, "that it should now be like this every day," she boasted her husband, Xenia Sobchac.
The picture shows Maxime making something eagerly, and the table already has salt and baked chicken.
Bulgarian prison officials held a national protest
Hundreds of prison officers from all over Bulgaria had held a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During a peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the return of the previous working conditions which had recently been changed.
The salary increase is also part of the list of requirements to be discussed with the Acting Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov.
During the month, the officers protested symbolicly against the new schedule of work, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the prison union had met repeatedly with the Ministry of Justice, no agreement had been reached, it was reported to the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
The talks are still under way, as reported by the BPR Head of the General Department for Execution of Sentences, Rosen Gelazkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will join the protest by the prison employees' union.
The army controls the new Thai government
General Praut (right) appointed Mr. Prait Wongsuvan, Minister of Defence (left)
The military leader and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chang-Ocha, announced the composition of the new cabinet of Ministers of the country, where more than a third of the positions are occupied by retired Generals or Generals.
The army received key positions: the Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chang-Ocha was officially appointed Prime Minister following the King of Thailand's formal approval of the appointment of the head of the interim military government.
A 60-year-old military officer who took power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup d'état of 22 May was the only candidate for the premier post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
The army had previously appointed MPs.
According to Prauta Chan-Ouch, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was followed by a six-month demonstration during which protesters demanded the dismissal of Prime Minister Yingluck Chinavat's Government.
Officially, Praut Chang-Ouch will be a temporary premiere, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military are trying to strengthen its power in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
With the total paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Jinglik Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also arrested.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army removed Brother Yinglik Chinawat Taksin as Prime Minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, and have been successful in the elections on many occasions.
However, many middle-class and capital elites have joined an anti-government movement that has almost paralysed the country since November 2013.
No one said that the media salad would be better, I didn't promise you that, and the waitress from the new Palm brass series is getting sick.
You have to officially admit that it is, but the mind and stomach remain constant.
Because everybody knows for a long time that we say "Belgium" -- we mean media, we say "Mids" -- we mean "Belgium."
Rectors like to assert deeply that the success of an institution depends on three factors: location, location, and, once again, location.
There are places that don't fit well, but even fine, but have some bad luck.
Anyway, when I sat down at Palm's table, I remembered that there was once a City Café (after that TV show), then an Odessa-Mother, and a restaurant called "God" and a "Friends" beer.
Now here's the beer room again, but it's not nostalgic Soviet, it's Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg was placed above the ground: a bar and a couple of tables, and all the rest of the space is without even a hint of sunlight.
But it's fun here, like in the children's room: red, yellow, and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows, TVs, where girls swim.
Belgium's institutions in Petersburg are no longer new, so you can compare them to something.
There are eight types of spilled beer (260-300 roubles per 0.5 litre) and countless bottles (170-1550 roubles).
A computer-positive waitress has a fun presentation of the menu, saying that "middles are fat large seeds," and it is worth noting that service, despite some disadvantages, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected for content, but often very unexpected for execution.
Well, who, for example, is allowed to predict that the meat roll with the Walloon prunes (280 rubles) is actually a carpaccio cut so thin that the pergament paper will appear uglyly thick in comparison to it.
You can only taste something if you warm up the poultry.
It's worse with the salads.
Classic levy (260) would be the most right thing to do to make it a crime against the Belgian people: some swollen iceberg, once baked a long time ago, swollen Kenyan beans, dried bacon chips, and something marinated onions.
You don't want to meet anybody with such a lazy salad!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If, for unripe quarters of tomatoes of cherry or overcooked chocolates, it was still possible to close your eyes, why did the mice look as if they had been defrosted and cooked several times in their lives!
Because I already know there are perfectly normal Belarusian media here!
They're served in bowls of sauce for your choice (490-560 roubles for 0.5 kg).
Sous half a dozen, the one with white wine, selderia, and carrots, didn't really work out.
There's vegetables, and there's no smell, and whether there was wine, there's still a mystery.
Well, they're good at mooring frites with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken water here is not so thick that you can decide whether the first or the second dish is in front of you, but just a nice cream soup.
It was said that a rabbit was cooked by a local cook in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On the contrary, rosemary suffocated everything.
It seemed as if the rabbit had been given only rosemary bushes in his lifetime, so that the meat had acquired such an extraordinary scent.
But at the same time, the rabbit's foot was attached to a wonderful--no, just a great pear in a caramelized crust.
The Palm waffles offer not only sweet but also nut, with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce turned out to be overly watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in the lunch experience.
Then we should come again.
The dollar's exchange rate has risen on the MIF over 37 roubles on the news of new sanctions being prepared by the West against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
By 10:29 a.m., the dollar for tomorrow grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 roubles, and the euro rose by 30 kopecks, up to 48.73 roubles, as shown by the Moscow Exchange.
The currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the previous closing level and was worth 42.28 roubles.
Before Crimean events, the dollar peaked on February 19, 2009, at a cost of 36.43 roubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was 37.005 roubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German chancellor Angela Merkel were considering the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both with the euro and with the dollar.
The long-term prognosis presupposed this mark, says senior analyst Anna Bodrova "Alpari."
Anything connected with Ukraine will somehow be reflected in the course.
As long as this continues, the investor will react.
Today, the rumours about the military invasion have not been confirmed on any side, but the market has been very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news yesterday was crossed.
The week is expected to close around these levels, 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, the price of oil is weak, the policy, the sanctions, the problem of the gas flow through Ukraine are all the elements of the same chain.
Inflation is also forecast to increase: 5 to 10 per cent will be added to current autumn prices.
And soon, we'll run out of seasoned vegetables and fruit, and we'll have some sort of vacuum while the networks are reoriented to other providers.
"The dollar came up to the 37 rubles mark, passed it and came back, some powerful hysterical, no," comments Constantine Bushuev, head of the "Opening the Broker" Market Analysis Department.
They will still see whether the promised sanctions will be introduced on Saturday, as will the meeting of the North Atlantic Organization.
The Ruble, he said, fell sharply after the end of the tax season, followed by news on Ukraine, and the CB last week declared that before the end of the year it was fully moving to the floating rate and was abandoning any foreign exchange arrangements.
When you look at the day-to-day swing, it's exactly the same as the previous one during this month, and it's exactly 37 rubles that scared everybody, and the analyst continues.
And so there's nothing powerful going on about the trade.
The turbulent times for the currency market were, I'll recall, when late January saw an increased demand for currency, as well as the third March, when the CB shipped a record amount of currency.
UFS IC also sees the positive side of weakening the ruble.
First of all, it's an increase in the revenue from export operations, as well as an increase in the competition of domestic producers through import costs, says the Chief UFS IC analyst Alexei Kozlov.
One of the negative aspects is the travel of imported goods and services.
The sharp swings in Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, trigger an increase in inflationary pressures, and result in an increase in the cost of borrowing money, which in turn slows the country's economy.
With regard to the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble has somewhat offset the decline in the price of shares expressed in the rubles.
For example, the MIFB index declined by 1.67 per cent during the Thursday trade and the RTS index lost 3.27 per cent.
This significant difference in the relative reduction of indices is due to a decrease of over 1.5 per cent in the course of the day.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy a currency.
As practice shows, the emotions gradually fade, and the ruble quotations partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We think we'll soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near the level of 36 roubles per dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
The British woman reported that she had spent many years thinking she would die after a misdiagnosis.
Caryn Rogers spent most of her teenager's life thinking that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had a problem with Sharco-Marie-Tut, a group of hereditary diseases that cause nerve damage outside her brain and spine.
The CMT UK charity reported that misdiagnosed diagnosis is a common problem among people with SMT because so little is known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are believed to have SMTs that can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, untrusted walking, and squeezing toes.
The sick can feel numbness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progressing, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Frederick's attack, a condition for which the prediction was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and die before she turned 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew as a child I couldn't do what the others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I've never been able to skateboard or skateboard with other kids, and I've been bullied a lot in school because I was walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked into the medical file when her doctor left the room and it was written that she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I stuck my nose where I shouldn't, and so I didn't tell anybody, but I came home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked, and I experienced the worst panic possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in this period.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she had realized that her ability to walk had not declined as much as she thought and had asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something that is a much smaller threat to your life.
After a couple of genetic tests, she was found with a CMT.
"When he explained what SMT was, I thought I had pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The UK SMT Charitable Organization announced a month of information about SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on the businessmen of the Washington Area is rising as the economy recuperates
The recovery economy means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country increased moderately last year, as economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and a company in the Washington Area is no exception.
The companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid 27.6 billion dollars to state and local treasury in financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the $266.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local business increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after the successive years, when the accounts declined, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes have increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study carried out by a professional firm, Ernest & Young and the State tax centre, the tax policy team.
More than half of the district tax revenue, 56 per cent, comes from business taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland tax revenue comes from the firm.
Virginia, with 28 percent, generates the lowest tax revenue, proportionally from employers.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a return to the value of companies' properties, says researchers, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 per cent.
While large states, such as California, New York and Texas, account for a large share of this revenue, the same seems to be happening in the Washington area.
Firms in the county, Maryland, and Virginia have collectively paid $10 billion in real estate taxes on the state and local level last year, an increase of $9.6 billion over 2012 -- an increase of 4.2 per cent over the previous year.
However, the observed return of real property value has no similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenue in Maryland, where real estate taxes are barely higher than one fifth of companies' tax accounts.
Virginia and D.C. companies pay about half of state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their property, especially their tax base around Columbia County, belongs either to the government or to a non-profit organization that doesn't pay taxes on real property," said Douglas Lindholm, the Executive Director of the State Taxation Centre.
So Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services as other states.
The recent increase in tax revenue from businesses cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Business income also seems to be improving according to these data.
The companies in the region have declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion compared to 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income tax revenue, most of all in the region.
While trends are in the same direction, the tax burden on employers at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was the same as the national average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth rate in Maryland was much faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenue rose below the average of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
Maryland has a corporate rate of 8.25 per cent, while the county has a relatively high rate of 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Trade earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower taxes on state and local businesses and a generally more favourable climate in terms of taxes on businesses than in Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbour from the South.
North Carolina recently signed a law that reduces the corporate rate from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, this law could raise the income tax rate for employers to even 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small business in the Washington area seems to be feeling better and thus paying more taxes on state and local levels, according to a recent study.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners -- the transitional structure under which most small companies are operating -- in Columbia County, Maryland and Virginia grew by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than the taxes on employers as a whole.
Researchers say that the trends and increases in business taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with sales taxes in state and local governments rising by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington zone may be lagging behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
Russian judo Brochure Age
The Judo World Cup offered the Russian team two silver and seven bronze prizes.
By this rate, Russians have only given way to Japan's main favorite competition.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk began on Monday, and the first day brought a silver coin to the Russian team.
It was owned by Beslan the Wise, who was in the category of up to 60 kg.
However, in an equal final struggle with Boldbat Ganbat from Mongolia, the end of the conflict resolved only one observation received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful day for Russia, and three coins were won on Tuesday.
In men's competitions, up to 66 kilograms of silver was given to Mikhail Pulyaev and the bronze to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian gave over to the world champion, Masashi Ebinume, Japan, in the course of the match.
Han-Magomedov, who had lost a fellow countryman in the quarter-final stage, had won a comforting tournament and had been the winner of a bronze prize.
In a women's tournament of up to 52 kg, Natalia Kusutin also reached the third grade.
In the semi-final, she lost an active world champion, Mailinda Kelmendi, from Kosovar, who played under the flag of the International Federation of Judos and successfully defended the title.
In the argument for Kusutin's armor, she won from Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she expected.
Once again, Kelmendi, a Russian woman who had won Kusutina earlier in the European Finals, became a barrier to her journey to gold.
On the third day of the Chelyabinsk tournament, the Russian team had placed the armour in the back of the Russian team, which had fought up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, he was abused by a former Moldovan representative, Victor Skohortsov, who is now a member of the UAE team.
But then the Russian won two battles and became the winner of the reward.
The mighty ones played at the home championship with a holnostope injury, which he plans to cure soon, so he will pause in the competition.
As for Svortsov's ex-moldiwin, he and he at this tournament got to the bronze Medal.
It is interesting that Ivan Remarenko, another of his countrymen, who had acquired UAE sports citizenship, completed his performance in the category of up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the CM-2014 also brought the Russians one armor, which Ivan Nifontov conquered in the category of up to 81 kg.
In the heavy battle of the small finale, he was defeated by the Frenchman, Alan Schmitt, on the basis of a comment from his opponent.
On Friday, three prizes were played at the tournament, but the Russians generally confined themselves to one armor in a men's tournament of up to 90 kg.
It was owned by Kirill Question, and the Russian team was guaranteed this Medal: his competitor for the comforting final was Cyril Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the questionable's opponent was unable to come to terms with his father because of the injury.
The man's armor was conquered by the owners and on the sixth day of the competition, it was deposited by Renate Saidov, who was in the category of over 100 kg.
In a comforting finale, he won a pure victory over Brazilian David Moura.
That's how the individual part of the world's supremacy ended.
On the last day of the Chelyabinsk tournament, Sunday, the world championships were played in team competitions.
Both Russian teams, both male and female, were among the main candidates for the prizes, but, as in the individual competitions, the women of the fine sex were not lucky; they did not get to the Medal.
But Russian judoists have won command silver.
In a decisive struggle against the scores of 2 to 3 they gave up to Japan's team's top winners.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after a clear victory by Khan-Magomedov and by will, Deniz Yartsev (up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese opponents, Murat Habatchirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiyev (100) were unable to cope.
In the same scenario, a bronze match in the women's tournament was developed, where the Russian team, with 2-0, gave way to Japanese 2-3.
Russian President Vladimir Poetin attended the Chelyabinsk team competition and congratulated the male silver team after the tournament.
"The second place is a very honourable one, but I mean, it was obvious that you might have become champions," said Poetin, whose words put the RIA "News."
Losing the Japanese, the judo-heads-- there's nothing shameful about it.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
Russia's home championship was much better than it was a year ago at a level like that held in Rio.
At the time, the Russian team had only three coins in it -- one silver and two silvers.
At the same time, the current tournament was skipped by the Aarsen Galstian and Mansour Isaev champions.
We're all, of course, big maximalists.
Yeah, I want gold coins.
But let's remember that if a person in the olympics cycle is part of an eight of the strongest, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
Of course, in a kind of sport like judo, the Russian Minister of Sport, Vitaly Mutko, summed up the results of the tournament, the words of which are quoted by the press service of the championship.
Japan's team was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medailles of various dignity, five of which were gold.
The next World Cup will take place in the summer of next year in Boston.

Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she arrived at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed her hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress will be cured of the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in her statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday, following an emergency call that she had a heart arrest at a hospital in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopie, reporting sources.
The doctors deliberately keep her under drugs and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "heavy."
The response was broad, including numerous Internet support from such people as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Everyone can do the Kings.
The band's debut album, Royal Blood, was a new hope for British rock, which brought rock-duettes out of the clubs directly to the stadiums.
Duoth Royal Blood has only been on stage for a year, but has already been promoted to the BBC Music Prize, the Arctic Monkeys opening tour and a visit to the New York concert dressing room from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut single album had received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before release, and the contract for its release lay in the Warner Music cabinet.
Given the current dire situation in the music market, the situation in the series is quite remarkable, since it is not about the new lana del Rey or another sweet voice representing the "new R'n'B," but about a duo of British-like bulls playing with the volume and intensity that was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the first album's stakes for all the above-mentioned circumstances were particularly high and have already been fully justified.
The duo had not for nothing taken a name that could have been compromised before, except for the desperately hairy metallists, and the blood of which the kings seemed to be flowing in their veins, too.
Of course, this is about the heroes of the last level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood is intended to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, leading it to a new height.
It's probably a little early to predict the success of this venture, but something can be confirmed.
A dozen songs in 30 minutes is not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer's talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Of course, some of the advantages of individual numbers cannot be denied: let's say that the "Out of the Black" single is marked by a drum party, not by a melodic line.
The musicians joke that this song is even easier to rattle than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing record of the "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
The truth is, however, that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy rock party, but when played consecutively, they combine into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it's not necessarily bad, even the other way around.
Royal Blood's power is that they don't claim the credit of the new Lennon and McCartney (preferably intended to be followed by Motturhead), but they've brought many rock-duettes out of the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, is designed for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousands of people, it's obviously tight.
The secret is partly to use the bass that replaced the Gitarre in a traditional format designed at the beginning of the Numeric Numeric Zero.
However, it's not just the tools, it's the way the songs are written.
The heroes of zero were hard-won outside the postmodern paradigm, and they were very reluctant to recognize themselves as independent creative units rather than just epigons.
Royal Blood is already sounding so powerfully and boldly that this pressure successfully ejects some secondaryity and hardness of music.
And at the end of the day, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMASON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: an online store and video production, and a hundred other things, buys a Twitch streaming video production service for $1.04 billion (US970 million).
This news turned out to be a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a customer.
Three months ago, selling Twitch to Google's video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a general flowing service -- the YouTube version in real time.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their internal moments; "YouTube for real-time games," says Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a genre of videos in which all-knowledge people (mainly old) play games like "The Mystery" are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch has been found without much interest, a classic example of a well-established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that, according to available information, he was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from the Chief Executive of Twitch Emmett Shire: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who say they'd rather sport than watch it, find it difficult to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking over the joystick themselves.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. when she crawls through the Resident Evil, and quite another -- watch some stranger get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching their images without controlling the angle of vision on their own can be a recipe for headaches worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speed in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic age finish the whole game in record time is entertaining.
But if it's not about the virtuality of the game or the humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be even interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and that's the fourth largest source of high internet traffic.
How exactly would Amazon make it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch will go to Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
But Twitch has something that any company would love to have: a crowd of young men that advertisers dream about.
As the head of Twitch Shire, Amazon, and Twitch said, "both believe in the future of the games," and this channel does not show signs of learning, even--oh--as an entertaining sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, died as a result of the 2004 attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to the surviving hostages -- almost all of the students now, to the parents of the dead, to the cemetery keeper -- the City of Angels -- Ramon Caspolatov, head of the "Mother Beslan" committee, Susan Dudieva, who took part in the special operation by a member of the MES, says to Elizabeth Antonov, a director of the "Society" department, who was working on a special project.
Upon his return to Moscow, he met with Aslambeck Aslahanov, who 10 years ago was the President's adviser on the North Caucasus and he was engaged in talks with the terrorists, as well as with Vjaceslav Bocharov, a member of the Russian Federation's Bureau of the FSB.
What struck me particularly during my work on this subject is that Beslan didn't seem to have been in those ten years.
This subject is extremely painful for everyone who has anything to do with it, and people find it hard to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," said Antonov.
A special project was developed by Rambler & Co's Infographic Holdings studio, which has been working for a company since spring.
Previous special projects focused on the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Poetin's reign.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea launched a short-range rocket
North Korea launched a short-range rocket in the Japanese Sea, reports the "Renhope".
The launch took place about 10:30 a.m. local time from the Province of Chagango, which is located on the border between North Korea and China.
It is assumed that the rocket landed in the Japanese Sea, flying about 220 km, and reported to the South Korean Chiefs' Joint Committee.
MPs suggested speeding up the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative is successful, these Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from 1 January 2015
A bill has been submitted to the State Duma to reschedule the date of entry into force of the already adopted Russian Personal Data Act, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the law of the lower chamber.
It was sponsored by State Duma members Vadim Gallin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov (the only Russia), Vladimir Parahin (the fair Russia) and Alexander Jushchenko (CPRF).
This change, according to the authors of the initiative, will help to ensure more quickly and effectively the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to maintain personal data and to respect the secrecy of communications and information networks.
A law whose entry into force is hastened by Parliamentarians requires Russians to keep their personal data online in the Russian Federation.
It also makes it necessary to record, systematize, store, specify and extract the personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation into databases located in Russian territory, as well as to specify the location of such databases.
The Act also gives Roscomnadzor the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of Russian personal data law on the basis of a court decision.
The Act also suggests the creation of so-called “black lists” of offending websites, an automated information system called the Register of Perpetrators of Personal Data Entities.
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The draft law was sponsored by Andrey Lugowa and Vadim Gollin of the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of the KDPF.
Money and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill to defer the entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who don't have data centers in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent.
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State Duma today, the first head of the Douma Information Policy Committee, Leonid Levin, said that he saw no problems in moving the date of the personal data protection law into force.
He said that those companies that would not have their own Russian personal data storage facilities in the Russian Federation by 1 January 2015, would be able to lease them, for example, to Rostelecoma, who had repeatedly said that they were willing to lease their servers and were already providing their servers, to Mail Group, Western companies that were already providing their servers.
"There are also several independent data centers willing to work together in this field," he added.
"If companies decide to abide by the law and continue to work in the Russian Federation, there is no problem -- they will get technological space to stay," said Levin.
Controversial Bill
Immediately after the bill was published, the Russian Electronic Communications Association raised concerns that, if the bill was passed, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
These include online booking services for airfares and hotels.
According to the association, “the bill prevents the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation - from managing their own data by making it mandatory that their recording, systematization, etc. be provided only in databases located in the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement stressed that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism to inform the user where the recording is made, to systematize its personal data.
In such a case, it would be possible to choose the area in which the said actions would take place.
The adoption of such bills to “localize” personal data in other countries has led to the loss of global services and significant economic losses.
A party to the test with a bucket of ice water sprained her jaw
Isobel Roberts, from the United Kingdom, shouted so much when ice water poured out on her head that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test with a bucket of ice water went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she had shouted so much during the test with a bucket of ice water that she had dislocated her jaw.
Isobel Roberts shouted so furiously when the ice water poured out on her head that it damaged her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I yelled, but when I did it, my jaw began to get stuck," she said to The Mirror.
The water is flowing to a 20-year-old.
Isobel Roberts seconds before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but it didn't close, it stuck, and then it came to me that something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister got the same understanding and they began to laugh, but I had to be taken to the emergency room immediately.
A 20-year-old woman from the United Kingdom was taken to hospital to fix her jaw after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The video became an online session and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The soldiers handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The army of Novorossia claims to have hit the Ukrainian Su-27 and accused the enemy of breaking the cease-fire.
As at 10 a.m. on 1 September, the soldiers handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by a spokesperson for the Newspaper.
He added that “by air defence forces in the vicinity of Mereska town a Su-27 aircraft was shot down, in breach of the cease-fire arrangements”.
According to the agency ' s interviewee, the Ukrainian side used cluster weapons prohibited by international conventions when shelling the Lugono airport.
The spokesperson for the press said that the militia had managed to damage two Ukrainian military aircraft in a night at one of the airports, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two armoured warehouses.
"The enemy's loss of life -- up to a hundred killed and wounded, surrendered to 13 prisoners," summed up a staff member.
Interfax has no evidence of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the “people's republics” of Donbassa announced that 223 captured soldiers and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine had been handed over to the Ukrainian side as part of the cease-fire regime.
At the same time, at night, the NPD army, according to the "Army of Novorossia," "has stopped an attempt by the National Guards, in violation of previous arrangements to remove heavy equipment from the area of the district."
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in a short combat, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to HQ, the total enemy casualties in all directions (Donetsk, Luganski, Mariopolski) during that night amounted to five tanks, eight armoured combat cars, and more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers found themselves surrounded by militiamen in the Ilowayska region of Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Poetin has asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian soldiers from the environment.
In the DNR, they agreed to do so on condition that the enemy handed over arms and ammunition.
The first dozen soldiers began to leave the encircled villages on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian Spatial Defence Battalion, Donbass, Semen Semenchenko, an additional 14 people left the Cotla on Sunday night.
In his Facebook account, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded were "in captivity to the 137 regiments of the 32nd division of the Russian Federation and the 9th tank crew of the Russian Federation" where they were treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of Russia denied reports by the Ukrainian military and by the United States of America of the presence of Russian forces in Ukraine.
MED Russian Federation: Russia will react if the EU introduces new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take measures to protect its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A report from the Russian foreign diplomatic department states that the European Council's “convictions” of 30 August demonstrated the failure of EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their unreserved support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine on the basis of "absolutely unsubstantiated claims of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country," as stated on the website of the agency.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member States, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in stepping up their confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as for a fully fledged “dialogue between the warring parties”, emphasize the agency.
The agency's website also notes that there are now no objective estimates of the humanitarian situation in Donbasa, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has occurred, as well as an increasing number of casualties among the civilian population.
We recall that within the next seven days the European Union is about to develop concrete proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with United States officials.
They are expected to correlate the measures introduced over the period of validity and severity.
New EU sanctions can affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian government has also announced an extension of sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Strict ways to save university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon be in second grade, has come up with a clever way of reducing costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My math book, which usually costs $180, I got a semester for $10 and a cookie called "Chick-fil-A," says Schroeder, who's 19 years old, who's a student at the University Covent in Georgia.
The necessary literature for the last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Board of Schools, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but students have a range of options to reduce these costs.
More and more students choose Internet stores and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
The purchase of books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use it during the semester, and often costs significantly less than buying it.
Nibo Incorporated, owned by more than 250 university bookshops, reports that book rent has doubled since 2011.
The industry studies show that about a quarter of the books in university bookshops during the last spring semester were rented, says the vice president of Nibo, and that this is a good idea.
Fewer than half of all books are bought in university bookshops, according to the professional association National Association of University Stores.
Here's an introductory course on how best to make a lucrative deal.
Internet Shopping
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see in the university bookstore.
The 9th edition of "Mathematic Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is worth about $290 on the list, but a new copy can be bought for $239.99 on the website of Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Harvesting used
If you don't mind someone else's mark or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
Mathematical Analysis is sold for $93.49, used on Chegg.com.
Matt Cassadey, 25 years old, a fourth-year student at Brigam Young University, says he paid 42 cents for Amazon.com for a second-hand copy of the textbook "Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business of the Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers like Ingrid Bracey, director of the "College Without Walls" at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invite students to ask their professors whether to use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are not relevant to the classroom.
In such cases, older publications can often be found for a very small portion of the value of the latter.
Besides the Chegg and Amazon websites, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular option for buying used books.
Leverage
The idea of renting textbooks is to think, if you treat them well enough, you don't forget to get them back and you don't want to keep them after the course is over.
You can save over 80 percent of the value of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent Mathematical Analysis for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you get the books, including any fines that you can pay for notes, highlightings, and damages.
If you rent a book, remember, if you do not return the book, fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.
Sometimes such books are leased for a certain period by the distributionists, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg.com "Mathematic Analysis" will cost about $61 for six months.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the best prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, while literature in natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look around.
Joe Golt, 29 years old, who is about to start law school in Pepperdin, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price of a book, as it guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering online, Golt says, make sure that the book is in the warehouse.
He's had a hard lesson.
The delivery of the book he had acquired was postponed for four weeks, and finally he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Poetin declared that the Far East Development Fund is completely inefficient
Russian President Vladimir Poetin said at a meeting on priority investment projects and areas in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, was inefficient, reports the Interfax.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposit," stressed the President.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested that the approval of the list of pre-development areas in the Far East be accelerated.
He recalled that the draft law necessary to create TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this fall.
The Federal Assembly, the President pointed out, had not approved the list of pre-development areas in the Far East and their criteria until 1 July.
Vladimir Poetin has also set the main goals for the development of the Far East.
These include improving the region's transport accessibility and removing infrastructure restrictions, both on the domestic market and on export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create preconditions for attracting additional investment into the region, as well as for creating pre-development areas that should become competitive with regard to the key business centres of the APRM, underlined by the President.
It has been previously reported that a pre-development area may replace an NEO.
Why the Guards of the Galaxy couldn't save the cashier's collections
Sylvester Stallone returned less than 30 million dollars from her $90 million budget in the United States, while "City of sin: a woman worth killing" returned only $12 million from her $70 million budget.
"The Home Video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's movies like "How to Harvest Dragon 2" also disappoint the revenue.
The Telegraph article by Robby Colleen suggests that when it comes to children's movies, it may be about the poor quality of the movies themselves.
Colleen called 2014 "the worst" year ever in the history of children's movies, and he called "How to Embed Dragon 2" a scarcely "functional" continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to movies directed at audiences of a somewhat older age, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the film itself.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film that was rented in the summer with at least 2,000 copies between the May and July 20, 2013 and the year.
Results that take into account both the viewers and the critics suggest that this year's film yield is similar to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that this may be about changing visual habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services such as Netflix.
The director of the film, John Fauro, who is currently working on a fast-paced Disney film called "The Jungle Book" said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We must recognize that and not try to pursue what was before.
In contrast to the current fall in Hollywood cash taxes, Netflix's revenue from the streaming reproduction service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's value of $837 million.
Last summer, the director, Stephen Spelberg, criticized the studios for relying too much on comic books, and foreshadowed Hollywood's red.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that there was truth in his gloomy predictions.
Since several potential cashier hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including the "Avengers: The Ages of Altron", the "Minionov" and the "Yur Park" are expected, other members of the film industry are more optimistic.
"The next summer will be the most cashier summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Productive sanctions do not frighten the owners of institutions with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants in Europe and Japan, Russian providers are a terrible dream.
Generally speaking, the common market still prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel, and China.
"There's a better cucumber than a bad mozzarella," lamented the cook of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of the cheese offered to him by the providers instead of the Italians.
Mozzarella and the burrat cheese ended at the restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
Parmesan must be stored for a couple more months.
What do you want to do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Roadmill market.
Mariono Valerio makes such eyes, which makes it clear that shocking memories keep him alive.
The meat there lay on carts just 30 cm from the floor!
There's cats!
Rats!
So I said, for our restaurant, we'll never buy anything on Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe things have changed now.
But the other day, they brought me fish from the Far East to test.
So it turned out to be bad!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio marvels that many of the usual things for Italy are for a Russian manufacturer in wildness.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hanged in a cold chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang out to be soft, so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get such tender meat?"
I said it's yours, Russians!
Why doesn't anybody do that to you?
At five minutes' walk from the Barlotti in the French restaurant Brassery Bridge, there's a stop-list in the kitchen showing the missing foods: French oysters, seafood.
The head of the Brassery Bridge restaurant and the Arrow bar, Régis Trigel, are not as pessimistic as Valerio: the oysters from France have already replaced with oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
Besides, Régis is getting more emotional when it comes to Russian providers: "Blue-coat: 200 roubles!
I say, "Why, on what basis is it so expensive?"
They say, "Well, we've got to earn some money too."
But this cabbage shouldn't cost more than 80 rubles!
Far East oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15 to 20 years, you know how much their shell weighs?
The price is that it's super-delicate.
Russian providers seem to be one of the main sources of terror for foreign cooks.
The standard story is, "The first three months were all right, then quality dropped sharply."
Main claims: Russian providers cannot withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many restaurants in Europe don't know what's going to happen when they're out of cheese.

On 6 August, President Vladimir Poetin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russian security, mostly called food sanctions.
The country is prohibited from importing beef, pork, meat and meat from poultry, meat delicacy, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurt, tomato, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
The restaurants had begun to sell food prices, and they had to look for analogues from other countries.
This will have the greatest impact on expensive restaurants with monocookies in France, Italy, Spain, where the products were supplied directly from the “materian” countries.
The general public has had to reconfigure before.
For example, when Rosselhoznadzor prohibited the import of Australian beef in early 2014 and a year earlier the import of American and Canadian meat.
In return, the vendors set up the supply of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer 2014 sanctions were much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved the changes to the Presidential decree, which remove from the ban the young Atlantic salmon and trout, lactonous milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for planting.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions may be reduced.
Meanwhile, some restaurants exist under conditions of uncertainty.
According to East West, one of the largest providers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the bonus segment was up to 70%.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergei Mironov, the restaurant manager, the owner of RestConsult.
If the cook is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we don't have enough cooks like that, and it might take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from Brassery Bridge is ready for this: 10-15% of the dishes will have to be discarded, half the menu will have to be processed.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, they're already starting to replace dishes like a beef beef steak, says Sergei Mironov.
"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Chile, Tunisia, and Tunisia, by Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of East West.
The cream and dairy products from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
The chicken from the United States can be replaced by a hen from Russia and Belarus, a salmon and a semma from Norway, a salmon, a semgo, a trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of European vegetables and fruit can be offset by domestic production, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget network restaurants will be rebuilt more easily than the prime segment, with hardly a gourmet that can distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Though it's hard for Ginza Projects, he thinks it's hard.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with its own menus.
It'll take a long time to replace," says Mironov.
In Ginza comments were rejected, citing a lack of ownership in the country.
The owners of the Caucasian and Central Asian Cafés emphasize that products from former Soviet republics taste better than European foods.
But there are many restaurants that the sanctions will hardly touch.
These include institutions with the kitchen of the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijan.
"There are no expensive foods in the Georgian kitchen," said Hatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the "Way Me!" cafe.
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, based on many dishes -- chicken fillet, exotic green we don't use."
No dishes have yet been removed from the menu at Colossians.
Timur Lanski, the owner of Chichon N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchens, the sanctions don't bother; he'll only have to change lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia were to import from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we would even win the price, it would be cheaper for us than it would for us to import from Europe, he said.
You can get cheaper cuts, lambs, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fruit.
However, what comes from Central Asia is much better than the plastics from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
We all know about Uzbek tomatoes that they're delicious, sweet.
No one says that about Spanish.
Following the introduction of the sanctions, a representative of the Ministry of the Environment of Uzbekistan, Olymboy Artikov, said that he intended to increase the export of fruit-producing products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan declared their intention to replace European imports into Russia almost immediately after the sanctions were introduced.
The fast food restaurants that responded to the "Denig" request are also quite calmly responding to sanctions.
McDonald's press stated that localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian vendors.
According to Tatiana Bohdanova, head of Subway Russia's supply department, about 80 percent of the products are bought by the network in Russia, although the supply of vegetables and the price of meat products produced from imported raw materials may be time-consuming.
In "Trail," "sanctionary products" were at least 4%.
The sanctions and the Vocker noodles were not affected.
KFC, Burger King and "Child Potato" did not respond to the "Deneig" request, but other market players argue that Burger King is much less localized than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East
On his bulwark
For the time being, the freezers are complaining that, due to increased demand, prices are rising even for local products.
"The average price for Grabley's products rose between 10 and 15 percent, and for the Italian restaurant "Cerry Meo" doubled," says the restaurant's author Roman Roshennikovski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of the dishes will rise by 5-10 percent, admits Kolbay.
East West does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have been traveling 10-15% since August."
"The Brazilian providers have doubled the price of pork," complains Sergei Racque, the deputy director-general of Stardogs.
Chicken ham traveled 35%.
Waiting for China's prices, maybe they'll cool off the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a scheduled price increase of 8%.
Now it's very undesirable to raise prices,' says the cancer.
Statistics show that the increase in general income in the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest indicator since 2010.
The retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how quickly: while most restauranters have stored their products for the next two months in the hope of waiting for price swings.
But what happens in two months, nobody knows.
In front of the Moscow City Hall, there are ten tents decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the stage, musicians play waltz.
It's a festival of Regional Products with the fun name "There's Time to Eat."
"We were going to make a local meal party a long time ago, and here's the sanctions, we hurried, we organized a festival," says one of the organisers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, the Greek cook Anastas prepares a salad of pasta and homemade candy, and recently there was a master class of cooking borche with caramelized apples.
All Russian products, the organisers assure.
In the tents, an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian national economy.
Bashkiria honey, a reindeer from Salehard, vegetables from a Moscow Lenin Supper, cheese from an overwhelmed Italian, Jay Clouse.
"A fish for restaurants can be replaced quietly by another fish of salmon from the Far East," said the owner of his own fish shop, Philip Halkin.
We've got nerks, whales, cucumbers, humps, chavs -- "Kingel's salmon."
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take him in, he doesn't even move.
And you can't keep our far east salmon.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic
In the window of his tent there are shrimps with a label called Magadan, cod, omul, muzzle, meadows from Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin thinks it's time to go to fish from the Far East.
Statistics show that fish catches in Russia in 2013 are over 4 million tons, and that a large part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Importing fish in 2013 is about 800,000 tons.
The Own People hunt has been working since 2012, selling fish through an internet store, serving a dozen more restaurants, such as "Simple Things" before the sanctions were introduced.
Now there are 15 more restaurants that have been asked to visit Galkin.
The same sushi can be made of our fish, he's hot.
We've got a lot of trouble, we've tried a lot of recipes.
Now we sell sushi on an Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper a few times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
As a confirmation in Galquin's tent, I'm getting a meal of Philadelphia with a whale.
Unlike the seven rolls, they have to chew longer, but knowing that this is our domestic fish gives us strength.
There are even halibut rolls and sea-bugs on the site of the "Homemans" store.
In sushi bars, it is true that Norwegian salmon is preferred to be replaced by Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains this because cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes for long-east fish.
"The Russian fish providers haven't offered us yet," explains the owner of the Killfish Bar Dmitry Eusev.
This situation is similar to that of other products: Russian producers could take over the vacated net, but this is not happening.
According to the founder and co-owner of the Lavka Lavka project, Boris Akimov is now more likely to import from Europe and America by importing from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong and large volumes of logistics.
They can quickly replace prohibited imports, unlike our farmers.
That is to say, the ban will benefit first and foremost the large producers of other countries," says Akimov.
In the last month, however, the restaurant industry received a more disturbing signal than food sanctions.
Following massive extra-curricular checks, three McDonald's companies in Moscow and two regional companies in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are examining the nature of the claims made to determine the actions required for the prompt opening of restaurants for visitors," said the McDonald's press office "the money."
No one really knows what's going to happen.
If everything is confined to food sanctions, it's one option that can be survived, an anonymously speaking employee of a restaurant consulting company.
But if they start closing McDonald's all over the country, the script will be quite different.
Europrotocol instead of HYDBD help
Casca payments can be received without the help of GIELD, so the BC aims to encourage the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has drawn up draft instructions according to which, from 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to do without a GIELD certificate.
It's true that it's only when the accident was processed on a "europrotocol" without the involvement of the traffic police.
So if there were only two cars involved, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the limit and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
Since 2 August, the europrotocol limit is 50,000 roubles, and as of 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Moscow and Leningrad will increase it to 400,000 roubles.
The point is that often even in slight damage, in a situation where an accident can be handled by a "europrotocol", drivers in an accident cause DPS.
For if there was a policy, it was not possible to obtain compensation for it without a GIELD certificate.
The parameters set out in the draft instruction are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for the cascae for a car accident processed without HIELD should not be lower than the limit for the Europrotocol.
At the same time, however, it cannot be above the limit set by the Casco insurance policy.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically able to unload both the DPS and the roads.
But it's probably not going to cheer the car driver or the insurer.
The latter already indicated a serious risk of increased fraud, which could be caused by the introduction of new rules for payment on the part of the caste.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver will usually wait hours for an inspector to take care of a little accident, because it's more reliable.
And we don't know what's easier to do -- beat the crooks or convince the drivers of the "europrotocol" trustworthiness.
Saving certificate will make name and irrevocable
The Minfin wants to ban bearer's saving certificates, but will allow banks to make them the equivalent of an irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban bearer's saving certificates.
Recently, this tool has gained popularity because the stakes here are higher than those on banking.
The fact is that bearer's saving certificates are not included in the deposit insurance system, and the bank is cheaper because there is no need to contribute to the Treasurer's (AEC) fund.
The picnicity of the situation is that this step is planned because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, but will be affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which are estimated by ASB to control 98% of the market.
With the Bank of Moscow accounting for about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained by the ASA, is that the customers of a small bank who have bought such a certificate attempt to obtain money from the ASA if their license is revoked.
Some depositors, without sufficient financial literacy and purchase of bearer certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.
A reasonable lack of insurance for these certificates if a bank license is revoked may lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there have been cases in which bearer certificates have attempted to collect insurance through the court,” the ASA stated.
The problem, of course, is inconceivable.
After all, no one would pay the purchasers of certificates, since they did not have a legal right to compensation from the State.
If the instrument were not insured with ASA, it would also ban metal accounts in which citizens' funds are counted in grams of one of the four metals: gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts are not included in the deposit insurance system, but their existence has not yet been compromised.
The fact is, probably, that bearer certificates are a very convenient security that can actually be a Quasidenegue.
There is little control over their movement: any bank client can buy a certificate, hand it over to any citizen, and before such a certificate is cashed, a large number of owners can change.
It was no coincidence that the bill stipulated that a saving certificate must be a particular security which should be kept by the depository.
And to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed without early maturity.
That is to say, the analogue of an irrevocable contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
There were protests this weekend by those who opposed the North Atlantic Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against the North Atlantic.
And Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was described as antisummit.
Stephen Fairklow followed the events for us during the weekend and spoke to the protesters who came from all over, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply arms to Iraq to counter the Islamic State's terrorist group, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TASS, referring to the decision taken at the end of the meeting of the Government of the Russian Federation, led by chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to be sending to Iraq 30 Milan man-portable anti-tank rocket systems and 500 charges, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The supplies will be made by the end of September.
In addition, a decision has been made to provide Iraq with an additional 50 million euros for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Mrs. Merkel will deliver a government statement on this subject in the Bundestag.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to hot spots.
The views of the people of the Russian Federation regarding the transfer of arms to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the soldiers of the Islamic State, while others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of the terrorists.
A Ukrainian patrol boat in the sea of Azov was hit by the military
The Donetsi militia bombarded a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August ITAR-TASS.
This was reported to have occurred in the Bay of Taganrog near the towns of Chiroquino and Benomnoy (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports that two coast guard boats have been fired upon.
It is clear that the incident occurred today about 1620 msk.
The teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenagers were transported by helicopter to a secure location after having spent the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went camping shortly after noon in Gowetts Lip in Blackhit.
The concerned relatives called the police about 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search party was sent, including local police and rescue teams, and a couple were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl broke her knee, and the young man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were picked up at the winch Monday morning.
They were taken by an emergency car in a stable state to Blue Mountins hospital.
Two Unions Meeting
The Minsk high-level talks did not solve the problems for which they were convened but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian
On a disturbing occasion (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delay), EU and Customs Union leaders first discussed a number of “hot problems”.
Whether such a structure can work effectively is not clear; however, it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
The questions in this regard fell off the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, followed by other Europeans and Europeans, saw the new President Lukashenko in the news.
The Belarusian leader set an example of a well-defined courtesy, which was the behavior of a man who just blew up the jackpot--and plans a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maydan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European commissioners (European Ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to address the final briefing on their behalf -- not just legitimizing the President with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for Minsk to be recognized as a full subject of European politics and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute for Policy Studies, Denis Meliantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same way as before.
"The fact that Kathryn Ashton met with Lukashenko suggests that relations with the EU will continue to be defrosted," he said, "Fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for a breakthrough by the Belarusian authorities began well before November's Maydan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
"The results have also been achieved with the EU -- the successful negotiation of visa and readmission, the dialogues on upgrading -- the "Fire" interviewer -- and the US has been the subject of international security talks.
The States have even lifted some sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reactions of the Belarusian leadership have only contributed to this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militiamen in Donbassa with all its severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk has not withdrawn from the Customs Union or from the OCD, and the Russian airbase is located in Baranowitz.
Brussels and Washington noticed Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue, and appreciated it, confidently by Belarusian experts.
As successful as Lukashenko's movement towards political diversification will be, it will be seen how often Minsk will soon be able to host EU+TC meetings.
In the press service of the EU's High Representative for External Policy and Diplomacy, Kathryn Ashton was unable to quickly answer questions about what Brussels expected from the new format.
The Spokesman for Ashton Maya Cosiancic merely said "Fire" that the issue of war and peace is not a priority.
It was reported that Kazakhstan could also be the next place to meet on the Ukrainian issue with the first persons in the new format.
A drop of degth for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he had been asked personally by the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all the parties would like Minsk to remain a central meeting place both in the Russian-Austrian format and at the level of heads of State and high officials of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” is becoming a fully handcuffed European leader who helps solve the global problem.
Best friend of a European farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Trade and Energy Commissions, led to the conclusion that the main theme of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbassa, but the economy.
Indeed, the meeting's timetable for future gas talks and for addressing the concerns of the TS countries under the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU seems to be broader than the peace declaration without a specific date or number.
However, the trade commissioner Karl De Güht pointed out that the EU representatives had “come to Minsk to find a solution to a political crisis that had economic consequences rather than vice versa”.
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine also works for Belarus.
Its consequences, and above all the Western and Russian reciprocal sanctions, are given to Minsk, who is still experiencing the sanctions pressure, the long-awaited space for manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Misses Research Centre, former President of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are keenly interested in the ability of Belarus to supply farm products to the Russian Federation without sanctions.
In doing so, supply schemes have been put forward for which Vladimir Poetin at the summit had laundered Minsk.
"The initiators of these schemes," said Romanchuk, "the fire," "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out supply schemes, including those from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have now been destroyed.
Russian business needs to somehow rebuild them, even through the intermediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies are willing to produce in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials, also oriented towards the Russian market.
Ukrainians have about $4 billion in export to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be very needed."
Romanchuk believes that the role of the owner of the EU and TS talks is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic ties with Europe.
He recalled that the loss of the European Union's agri sector from Moscow's sanctions was estimated at Euro5-10 billion, while the European Commission was currently offering only Euro125 million compensation to the farmers.
The Belarusian president may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for the European farmers.
This can raise the EU's voice in Lukashenko.
Hostage without initiative
Kathryn Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the irony is that the official Minsk is deactivating its active role in the birth of the TS+EC format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague has stressed that Kyiv is the initiator of the new format.
"It was your offer to meet, without any trouble, to discuss, not from the Bay-bar, to decide, after signing the Association Treaty with the EU, to address the situation which was currently taking place in Ukraine," he addressed the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.
However, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which was said to have originally been against Minsk's intermediation, which greatly increased its political importance.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department it is carefully emphasized that Belarus, when it organizes interaction between the EU and the TS on its land, does not pursue selfish purposes, and the ultimate goal of this format is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
“It is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts which, in other areas, particularly in the area of security, put forward and advance the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation,” said the “Fire” in the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an office which has recently carefully chosen the words.
There may be pay-as-you-go zones in Moscow.
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of pay-as-you-go zones as a method of controlling the overloading of central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, to be M24.ru, with reference to the Moscow Vice-Maxim Likutov Transport Assistant.
One of the options that has been successful is payment entry.
It's an expert opinion, we'll certainly study it, we'll look at all the negatives and the positives.
To say that some decisions have been made on this matter, not yet,' said the Lixuts.
The President stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow, is of great importance to the capital authorities.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already under way construction of the central ring road, added the Lixuts.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to skip all traffic through Moscow.
If there was enough bypass infrastructure, there was no need to have a transient traffic in Moscow," said the US-Moror.
Maxime Lixutov also said that the introduction of laundered parking had significantly unloaded the streets of the capital.
And, he said, the capital authorities don't plan to stop on what they've done.
On 26 August, the Russian capital's mayor Sergei Sobian participated in the construction ceremony of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Round Road (CACAD).
Boring Sinable
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, "City of Sins-2: A Woman for Whom to Kill" had not revolutionized at all.
The first "City of Sin" (2005), filmed with a minimal but symbolic participation by Queentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between film, comic books and literary nuar.
The sequel is also in its own way a revolution: in the sense that it breaks the fundamental modern thinking chain of "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" (as defined by the concept of the universe of nuar and the antithesis-space comic book).
From now on it should read "thesis-anti-thesis- chaos."
"City of Sin-2" is chaotic on both the dramatic and the philosophical levels: both times it is chaotic in a bad way.
Yeah, some of the heroes are familiar with the first City, although, here comes the big Marv (Mikki Rourke), I remember, ended my life on the electric chair, and here, nothing, just managed to extract -- as a native maid -- knives and other axes from the air.
But old people are literally pushed out with their elbows by newcomers, like they broke into town from some other movie, whose meaning and story the audience is asked not to worry about.
So, his story, shamelessly shattered by the authors at the most interesting place, by the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Lewitt).
Hers is the lustfully-free-frying Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for something avenging her by Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion in which, let's say, Dwight's face is not different from Johnny -- especially since faces, like other parts of the body, are being thrown down to characters with inexorable regularity -- is no trouble or even half a trouble.
They're not people, we know they're noir archetypes: a fatal bitch, a self-confidenced player who's caught in the honey trap of sex by a detective, a corrupt upirist sensor.
Well, when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and an archetype chases, it's not a movie, but an abstract painting.
And it's funny to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the story.
Besides, even in this troubled world, there's something permanent.
Fighting whores from the first City continue to hold a round of defence against the crowds of darkness that besiege them.
And Detective Hartigan's ghost is gone, and he's going to look at the fire, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem with City of Sin 2 is another.
Frank Miller was good because as a drawer talentedly combined the comic book and the nuar, and as a director, he turned the idea of moving comics to the screen.
Comics and Noir are two aggressively opposite "realities."
The contemporary comic book phenomenon was born in the late 1920s, at the same time as the novels of Dashill Hammet "The Bloody Harvest" (1929), "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created a canon of nuar, then known as the Hard-boiled School.
Or pulp fiction.
The comedians gave Hollywood dozens of heroes, from a sailor named Popey, who eats spinach, gives him rich power, Superman, Batman, and stings Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "revenants."
But in any comic book film, there was something bad about it: painted characters persistently refused to grow up with screen flesh, remained pretending to be in the world around them in the will of the "real" world.
Simply put, they were totally out of "existence."
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After world wars, a traditional novel -- with experiences, character, family scandals and history -- lost all credibility.
What are the Forsythes, what are the Tibos and Rogon-Mccars, what are the Bolkons and Rostovs even thinking after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into a soap opera, and a criminal - that is, a marginal - novel rose to the level of a philosophy.
Hammet found out in his skin what it's like to work as a nurse on the front.
He was a Commie.
As, by the way, were at least close to the company and the clusters of genres like the writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, the directors of Julie Dassen, Joseph Lawsie, Edward Dimitrick.
So the noor, the archetype of which they set, is first, rough and cynical, and second, purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first "City of Sin" was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically connected the comic book to the nuar.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book came alive, with no shyness in its graphical nature, rather than pretending to be a real movie.
The dream of a corrupt world where the cardinal ordered the murders and the senator covered the monstrous sadist son was quite worthy of Hammet's feather.
And the paintings are like the cut-off heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the brilliant James Elllroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best -- that is, the declarative nausea, the neonourist.
"City of Sin Two" is not even a retreat, but a surrender of Miller-Rodriges' radical styles to the comic book tradition.
It probably happened in a lot of ways because of 3D technology.
When you watch the second City of Sin, you feel like a prisoner in a glass ball where the snow falls into a toy cloak.
Most often, though, it's not snow, it's bloodlines, but basically, what's the difference?
Well, there's nothing to talk about about sociality.
Because it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere we have sometimes, even on the side of the dirt moor, but there's a normal world where you can get a girl who's gone down the road or, say, a sad parent who's been punished.
But if there is no place for sin in the city but sin, then sin is no more a sin, but a norm.
Boring as any standard.
Chaos City of Sin Two is just boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic lease gave this fresh sin a small but pepper.
The titles warn: The film contains dangerous smoking scenes.
In view of the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a man's fingertips break, it gives him hellish humor.
Hammet would love it.
French socialists have to "shut up and bring France to order," says Frasous Holland's key ally.
Mr. Valle called upon the deeply divided left forces to “exercise the warmth” of the attacking socialist president, whose conversions were not approved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our devotion, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, voicing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister affirmed that his Government would not call into question the disputed 35-hour working week in France, despite inciting conflicting proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economics, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his fellow members of the Socialist Party to remain "united" with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the Minister of Justice, had put sticks in the wheel, coming to a meeting of dissenting members of the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost their faith in the future”.
Marin Le Pee, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not realize that the new Wallian government would last longer than a few months.
Francis Hollande is a bare king, but a nude and Prince Manuel Valle, forced to gather a new government when the previous summer failed.
"And the new one won't last the fall or winter," said Mrs. Le Penn to the reporters.
She repeated her party ' s call for the Parliament to be dissolved, saying that she was sure that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to run.
The reigning French party survived the March municipal elections, and the extreme right-wing national front came first in the EU elections in May.
A Sunday Journal du Dimanche poll found that 76 percent of the French believed that the Socialist Party was at risk of breaking down into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Holland's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Xiang Poe, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record joblessness.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"The City Without Dope" is without a suit.
The Sverdlovsky Court of Arbitration dismissed the action by the Regional Department of Public Administration of the City Without Drugs Foundation.
The office intended to collect more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rent for a building in the centre of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the Sverdlovsky Regional Court of Arbitrators dismissed the action of the Executive Director of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Region (MOGISO) against the City Without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders is the President of Yekaterinburg, Eugenius Roysman).
The district authorities intended to charge the organization with $7.3 million as rent for the building.
It was now known that the plaintiff had failed to appear before the court twice and that the decision to refuse the hearing had therefore been made.
The reason for the absence of the MAGISO directorate was not clear; Maxime Titov, the head of the legal department, did not answer the telephone.
No contact was possible with the Foundation either.
Remember, this is a mansion that has occupied a foundation in the city centre on Belinski Street, 19 on a non-reimbursable basis since 2011.
This decision was made by the former governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Department of Public Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a claim with the Sverdlovsky Court of Arbitration for the removal of the foundation from the building.
According to the action, the agency requested, through the court, that the non-contained free use contract be declared as the premises of the monument's mansion.
According to the IOGISO directorate, the agreement did not contain substantial terms for the lease of a cultural property.
The Sverdlovsky Court of Arbitration dismissed the claim and an appeal was filed with the 17th Court of Arbitration, Permi, which was granted.
The foundation then filed an appeal against the decision with the same court, which had not been satisfied, and the decision was then appealed by the foundation to the High Court of Arbitration, but the court accepted the direction.
A new lease agreement was concluded in 2013, under which the foundation began to pay the rent again, as reported by the head of the city, Eugenius Roysman.
The rent was set at 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous district government handed us this building free of charge, acknowledging our anti-drug credit, as a sign of respect for the foundation.
The current administration had decided otherwise," he said.

Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On July 24, President Alexander Kosintsev of Yekaterinburg invited the city's Speaker, Eugenius Roysman, to resign.
The criminal case concerned an arrested woman suspected of murdering deputy Oleg Keenev, a member of the council, who was considered a member of the mayor.
How Eugenius Roysman found a criminal case
On 1 July, it was reported that a criminal case had been opened on the basis of a “failure” (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code) on the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugenius Roysman.
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk Region by Anna Filatov's Director of the Defence Law Center.
According to her, Mr. Roysman accused her of having blogged for having been involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "it's another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will turn into a wallet
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is due to present its new designs, more leaks appear in the press about what you can expect from the presentation.
Referring to US media sources, the sixth generation of the iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint Apple project with the Visa, MasterCard and American Expression payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and Specialized Internet Resources Re/code, on September 9, Apple could also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Expression, which will make the iPhone 6 mobile wallet function available in the new smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse any comments on this matter.
This function allows payment to be made on the account of the store using a smartphone.
The user will identify the payment by fingerprinting it using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will have the first NFC technology built into, which allows for a non-contact payment using a smartphone and a corresponding reader on the register.
The NFC technology itself will be made available by a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum, an association to advance this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with the NFC function, Samsung Nexus S, was launched in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced a Google Wallet system that allows users to attach bank cards to their Google account and to pay with a smartphone on Android.
In fact, US experts stress that, despite large investments by high-tech companies in advancing NFC technology, US Ritters are still cautious about innovation and are not willing to spend money on the equipment of their shops with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's entry into this market will still force the retellers to accelerate and accelerate their implementation of this technology in their outlets.
MlD of France: Paris's position on the supply of Mistrals to Russia has not changed
The official representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Roman Nadal, declared Paris's unaltered position concerning the supply to Russia of a type of Mistral helicopter.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (France Holland) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August: "Today's level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
It's a European decision, not a French one," quotes Mr. Nadal's "RlA News."
So the representative of the French foreign policy department replied to the question whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in the position of Paris in the execution of this contract.

National Security Council of Ukraine: seven soldiers lost their lives in the area of military operations in the past 24 hours
The representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Andrey Lysenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had died in the area of combat in the east of the country and 25 others had been injured during the past 24 hours.
The situation under Iloway is extremely difficult.
No details will be made available until the withdrawal operation is completed.
Upon completion of the operation, information on the loss and causes of the situation will be made public.
Those responsible for this situation will be held responsible,” Mr. Lysenko added, refusing to discuss the situation in more detail under Iloway, where several Ukrainian battalions are surrounded.
According to the representative of the SNBO, “every effort is being made to return the soldiers who have been held prisoner”, reports ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lysenko also pointed out that the Ukrainian military had departed from Luganska airport in the direction of the town of Georgievka.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion deal with Prestage Cruises
The Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stage of negotiation for a similar company, Prestigue Cruises International Inc., for about $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to cruise ships of the "lux" class and secured clients of Prestage Cruises, as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week by sources on Sunday, warning that the talks might still fail.
The owner of the Prestigue Cruises, a private investment company called Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise's shares.
Sources requested to remain unnamed because the talks were not open.
The representatives of Norway's Cruise and Prestigue Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, manages 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent over 2012.
Prestigue Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands of Oceania and Regent, which together owns eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She announced an income of $1.2 billion in 2013, an increase of 6 percent over the previous year.
The $99 billion cruise industry is expected to have a positive effect in the coming years on the growth of middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
The competition companies seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. governments for primary public stocking in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after a $850 million deal in 2007.
The Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists in 2000 as a result of a merging with a cruise operator belonging to the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a entertainment conglomerate and a Casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Coke Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in the Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
The Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a 28 percent share, Apollo owned a 20 percent share, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP owned an 8 percent share of the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of the cruise passenger flow in North America, according to registration documents for the first public posting of Prestige Cruises.
Crimea Telecommerce can get 250 million roubles of subsidies
In Mincomcom, Russia is offering 250 million roubles in 2014 to a state-owned television and radio company called Krim.
As reflected in the draft Mincom-Community Resolution, which is available on a single standard-setting release portal, subsidies are intended to be spent “to cover the costs of creating the conditions for large-scale information coverage of the social and economic situation and the development of modern information space in the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also be used to buy equipment, repair roofs and power systems in a telecom company founded in 1959, reports "RlA News".
Hong Kong Democratic Movement activists prevent the Chinese representative from speaking the day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood close, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday has set a procedure under which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the election of the Hong Kong leader in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of a majority of the members of the nominating committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for a democratic opposition to go to the vote sheet and makes democratic activists promise to stop Hong Kong's financial center again with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describing China's control over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city's business centre and took a sitting strike.
Li's briefing is organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Communications Bureau in Hong Kong.
The vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Djang Rongshoun, and the deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Bureau of the State Council of Feng Wei were also scheduled to address a series of talks during the day.
The activists announced that they would meet at the Hong Kong Head of Government in the afternoon.
Britain had not mentioned democratic government for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to add 400 ha of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to add 400 hectares of land on the West Bank of the Jordan River belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to BBC, the decision to join South Beetle's land is linked to the desire to retaliate for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence announced the occupation of the Territory on Sunday and ordered the military to set up an administrative office on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, the world must hold Israel responsible for “the continued settlement activity on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem”.
Poetin requires Kiev to start talks on the statehood of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports of his comments, Russian President Vladimir Poetin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease fighting with the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start talks about the “statehood” of the separated region.
His Spokesman, Dmitry Pescove, later explained that Poetin did not mean to suggest that East Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be re-examined in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to defend its rights and interests.
However, Poetin's call on the government of Kiev to start talks with the pro-Russian rebels as equals to the obvious strategy that it followed since the beginning of the bloodbath five months ago: to help the separatists take the Territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossia de facto independence in order to get closer to Russia rather than to the West.
In an interview with State First Television Channel, Poetin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the Separatist-held Territory to the eastern Donetsk and Lugon oblasts, which had been seized in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists recently called the seized areas Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Poetin said that anyone who believed that peace talks would take place in the near future when Ukrainian politicians began campaigning for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces attacked peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, the “plenary of illusions” reported by ITAR-TASS.
"We must immediately start meaningful talks, not only on technical matters, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there," he said.
Sandov said that Poetin's words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed over the months with the leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the Eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Sandov.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Sandov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Kremlin's Spokesman in order to correct the “failing interpretation” of Poetin's words underlined the Russian leadership's decision to behave against the secessionist uprising in the east in a way other than the open capture of Crimea, where most of the 2 million people are Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much harder battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugono oblasts of eastern Ukraine, since most of the six and a half million inhabitants were not Russian, and interviews before the conflict began showed widespread support for staying inside Ukraine.
The autonomy which Russian diplomatic discussions in international fora would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade arrangements and foreign policies themselves, in fact by handing over to the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would link Russia's main territory to Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, which was joined five months ago, there is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical sea resorts.
There are also mines, factories and lithium factories in the regions between the Rostov region and Crimea, which produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko suggested, during his opening speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian lawmakers, after new elections, weigh the changes to the constitution that allow the segregated regions to have greater control over their finances and languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels accused of arming and inciting Moscow.
Poetin's last call to Kiev to agree with the leaders of the Separatists, as with the equals, followed the new rebel attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a former peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists took control of the city of Novoasovsk in an attack about which Ukrainian security officials say that they fear it is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic shorelines to Crimea itself.
This has led to extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between the Novoasovian passage and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Porokenko called on Saturday for a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of non-return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any action; the leaders called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia to be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaysk after two columns of Russian armoured equipment and 1,000 military soldiers last week entered the Donetsk region to support the troubled separatists, Colonel Andri Lisenko, the press secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reported to be being held in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion were traded on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, reporting to Lysenko on Sunday.
A scandal with a picture of itself taking over Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his abhorrence for hackers who may have stolen naked photos of his bride, Gabi Greco, and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was outraged when a series of frank photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence came online as a result of a massive hacking scandal with celebrities.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have about 60 open photos of the star Lawrence and the superstars, including the models of Kate Upton and Kara Delevin, the singer Rihanna, Adrian Grande and Leah Michel, and actress Kirsten Danst.
Australian actors, Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Stratovski and living in Melbourne, also allegedly had stolen photos from an iCloud leak.
There are 101 famous names on the list.
Edelsten, who made the Greek proposal last month, said Confidential, "That's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's awful that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York City, said to the news website that the hacker attack was "shameful" and that the target people were "feeling invaded."
The hacker's supposed to have 30 photos of Palmer with Scott Speedman's ex-boyfriend, including two images of her lying by a pool with her breast bare.
Palmer's work in the movies includes "Love and Honor" along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the movie "Chuck" by Stratowski and the actress from "Prohibited reception" by Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen photos.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ, "This is an outrageous invasion of privacy."
The actor, Set Rogen, expressed his resentment against the hacker by tweeting: "Puting photos stolen from a mobile phone is really no different from selling stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, you can't stand publishing stolen photos.
Possible way of stealing photos of naked celebrities discovered
The massive hacking of star accounts is probably due to vulnerability in the Find My Phone application.
A potential scenario described The Next Web resource.
A Python script was published on the Github resource, which allowed for the collection of passwords from the Find My Phone service of Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
The same combination of login and passphrase is used to access the Apple iCloud cloud from which images of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed you to over-recognize the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces all sorts of combinations of characters, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The script author argued that there was an unlimited number of password input options in the Find My Phone service.
If the security system is properly organized, after several failed attempts to enter an incorrect password, the account must be locked and reported to the user of an attempted hack.
Because of vulnerability, users have not received any reports of trying to get a password for their account.
The hackers found the password from Apple ID and used it to access the iCloud.
According to Hackapp on Twitter, vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and a script program was written to pick up passwords.
Vulnerability is now closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hackapp user and he said that the above-mentioned vulnerability is common in many services, but he said that he had no evidence that this vulnerability was used to access the "stars" account.
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister again appeared foreign recordings
While there is no solid evidence that vulnerability was used to steal photos in Find My Phone, there was a wave of malpractice using this service.
The hackers intercepted the controls of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that the safety of clouds had not been compromised, but had not investigated how users had lost their accounts.
In Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, the Russian Prime Minister's Twitter, had also been hacked.
If the intruders had access to the iCloud described above, there could be a password for the head of government account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource could not get Apple's Vulnerability Comments in Find My Phone.
Poetin granted Russian citizenship to a Ukrainian five-gauge
Russian President Vladimir Poetin granted Russian citizenship to a famous Ukrainian sportsman named Anne Buryak.
The decree is published on the Internet Portal of Legal Information.
Earlier this year, the sports woman moved to Russia for a permanent residence and requested the Federation of Modern Five Fights to be allowed to stand for the Russian Federation.
In 2013, she won two rounds of the World Cup, won a silver European championship, and became a champion of the world in a mixed relay, which is one of the new types of sport.
It also holds a leading position in the current season.
By the rules, she would need a special permission from the Ukrainian Olympian Committee to speak at the 2016 Rio Games.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian sports woman to change her citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Poetin decided to issue a Russian chess passport to Caterina Lagno, a native of Lviv, who is a double champion of Europe (2005, 2008), a world in Bliz 2010 and a fast chess (2014).
As part of the Ukrainian women's team, she became the winner of the chess championship in Turin, the world championship in Boston, and the European championship in Warsaw.
The SCR stopped the investigation into the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukowo
The Russian Investigative Committee (RCC) dropped the criminal case for the crash of a Tu-204 plane by Red Wings.
This is reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the commandant of the aircraft and the aircraft engineer.
Forensics found that the crash was caused by an increased speed of landing, by the crew ' s failure to meet standard landing procedures, and by the unintentional introduction of engines to higher direct traction speeds.
The Tu-204 flight of the Red Wings flight of Prague-Moscow crashed on December 29, 2012, landing at Vnukovo airport in Moscow.
The airship rolled over the runway and set fire.
At the scene of the incident, an aircraft commander, a second pilot and a flight engineer were killed.
Two flight attendants were taken to hospital, where they died of injuries.
Three additional flight attendants hospitalized with serious injuries were treated for long periods.
In addition, a driver of a car was seriously injured during a crash on the Kiev highway.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
After the accident, the Transport Office carried out an investigation at Red Wings, during which numerous abuses were detected.
In February 2013, the company's license was suspended.
The company resumed its work in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelianenko began training in SIZO
A famous Russian mixed-style soldier, Alexander Emelianenko, 33 years old, who is in SIZO on charges of sexual assault against a domestic worker, has recovered completely from the injuries and has begun training.
This is reported by the Chempiot.
In May this year, the Russian Investigative Committee charged Alexander Emelianenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted and arrested in Tambowa on 9 May following an accident which caused a broken hip.
The Jemelianenko Jr. was arrested until 31 August and a sentence was ordered on 1 September.
However, the trial was postponed and the investigation insisted on extending the period of detention until 30 September.
If proved guilty, the sportsman would be sentenced to up to six years' imprisonment.
What's the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelianenko's career.
He spent his last match in January of this year, losing a technical knockout to a fellow countryman named Dmitri Sosnovski.
Alexander is the younger brother of the more famous fighter Fedor Emelianenko.
The latter is a four-time world champion in mixed combat arts, a four-time world champion, and a seven-fold Russian champion in combat samba.
Angrily turned out to be the most universal and functional emotion of the human being
An angry expression is biologically universal for humanity, and each body and group of muscles involved in it is not random, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers from Australia and the United States have discovered.
They spoke about their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and you can briefly read them in a press release by the University of California in Santa Barbar.
The angry expression of the face is a tilted and lower eyebrow, stretched out into a thin line of lips, splashed nostrils are the same in all cultures, and makes it even blind children who have never seen it, notes the researcher Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, researchers found that this emotion emerged to effectively manage conflicts during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can do to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his condition, and he communicates it to the person in question by means of anger.
Researchers have also found evidence of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and take advantage of their actions, feel free to subject others to conditions that are disadvantageous to them, and prefer forceful methods of conflict resolution to be peaceful.
Rejecting that anger is above all an “emotion of trade,” researchers decided that the movement of each of the seven muscle groups, creating an angry expression of the face, should make the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewee, and thus force him to accept its terms as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, researchers modelled on the computer persons who had or were missing each of the seven elements of the angry person and showed them to informers.
While lowered eyebrows or advanced chins individually did not make the face angry, the more physically visible person was recognized by the researchers as unanimity.
Human anger, like animal rage, is a threat: an exaggerated act of self-power that forces you to accept and obey.
A person grows his nose and his lips for the same purpose as a frog that blows up, or a baboon that shows his fangs.
An “starts” with the person concerned's failure to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that best illustrates the consequences of this denial.
But the amazing thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary; they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tuby.
Minicom offered to provide 250 million rubles to Crimea's radio company.
The minicom has offered 250 million roubles from the federal budget of the autonomous non-profit organization Krim Teleradio Company.
This is mentioned in a draft government decree prepared by the department which was examined by Lenta.ru.
According to the memorandum to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be allocated “to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information coverage of the social and economic situation and the development of modern information space in the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, hardware, video walls, central hardware and video servers are to be rebuilt for the money allocated.
A mobile television station and a satellite sender are also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fiber-optic line (VALS) and for the repair of the power system.
Subsidies will be provided within the limits of the federal budget provided for the Minicom.
The State broadcaster Crimea was founded in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, television coverage of the broadcasting company is over 75 per cent of the peninsula.
In 2011, Krim's Teleradio Company acquired a digital broadcasting licence.
