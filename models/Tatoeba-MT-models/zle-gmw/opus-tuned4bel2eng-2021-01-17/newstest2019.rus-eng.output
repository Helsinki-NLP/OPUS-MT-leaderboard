Number of new soldiers in preparation to be sent to Donbas from Ukraine
The official representative of the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Lugono People's Republic (LDR), Andrey Marocko, said that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new soldiers to Donbas in the winter of 2018-2019.
In this way, he said, Kiev plans to "have some way to complete the units."
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian military, mass dismissals have led to low levels of force," said Marokko, quoted by the RlA News.
Nor did he rule out that the real numbers of enlisted Ukrainians could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kyiv began a so-called anti-terror operation (APO) which was later replaced by a United Force operation (JFOR).
This measure was intended to increase the role of Ukrainian activists in the resolution of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbassa became worse because of the murder of the head of the DND, Alexander Zaharchenko.
The DNR authorities have described what happened as a terrorist attack.
Several persons involved in the explosion were arrested during the investigation of the criminal case.
Preliminary evidence suggests that they have confirmed that Ukrainian intelligence services have set up a diversion.
U.S. government forced the Mask to resign from the presidency of Tesla
An American businessman, Ilon Musk, will retire as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla, a company founded by him, at the request of the U.S. authorities.
To settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman will also pay $20 million to settle the claims.

The head of the British MIDA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and prison
The British foreign minister, Jeremy Hunt, compared the European Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of captivating the member countries of the community.
This statement was made by the diplomatic speaker at the meeting of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail points out, Hunt has thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to belief in Europe's dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to defend freedom, and the Soviet Union kept it from leaving.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from a community to a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity,' said the Minister.
He added that trying to punish Britain for getting out of the European Union would only worsen the crisis, notes Gaceta.ru.
In mid-Sept., British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the Brexit talks had stalled.
So she comments on the outcome of the EU informal summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was adopted in 2016 by referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom was expected to take place before April 2019, but discussions with Brussels on the matter were complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will work together after London leaves the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.

Named Moscow with the cheapest apartments
In the first six months of 2018, Moscow bought about 30 square metres of apartments worth up to 4 million roubles.
More than half of these transactions took place in two VCs, as shown by the Urbanus Portal (available at Lenta.ru).
Up to four million roubles of house sales have been led by the LC Neracowska, located outside the ICAD, in the Kotelniki district (Uvao), and by the Barbaris complex in the Bibirevo district.
Two VCs in New Moscow, South Bunino and the Cloud Alley, were also visible in the structure of the transactions with the budget.
Urbanus analysts note that the share of apartment transactions up to 4 million roubles in these facilities reaches 60 percent of the total sales and provides half of the total revenue.
"The impact of apartments with a budget of less than 4 million roubles on the commercial success of the Central District in the New Watutinkas and the LOG Philatov Lug is to be recognized," says a study of two more New Moscow LCs.

Telegram users complained about a failure in the new version
Users of the iPhone have complained about problems with Telegram messaging since the update of September 28th.
The user's phone number can be obtained by reference to the user's number.
The complaints relate to gadgets with a valid iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, after updating, the application displays a white screen or closes immediately.
Messaging agents reacted to a malfunction.
They said that the problem might be the migration of information to a new Swift application.
On Telegram, the automatic updating of the application was temporarily suspended until the problem was resolved.
On April 13, the Moscow Court granted Roscomnadzor's motion to block Messinger Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the communication operators began to execute the decision.
The reason for this was the failure of the Messaging Authority to provide the FSB with the key to decrypting the correspondence necessary to obtain data on the terrorist.
In August Telegram changed the policy of privacy and agreed to uncover the IP address and mobile phone number of the suspected terrorist user when a court decision was received.
Telegram has decreased by 1.2 million since the blocking in the Russian Federation
I'm glad for the guys who went out to realize the numerical advantage in a match with the Minsk Dinamo.
Bob Hartley: Welcome to the guys who went out to realize the numerical advantage in the Minsk Dinamo game.
Bob Hartley, the Chief Trainer of the Avangarde, summed up the score of the regular HLC championship against the Minsk Dinamo (2:1).
A very important victory for us.
After a match in St. Petersburg, we held a meeting and agreed that we should leave the game behind and prepare for Minsk.
We knew Dinamo had a good win before we met, so we were prepared very seriously.
It was important to drop in most, I'm glad for the guys who went out to realize the numerical advantage.
We've been playing well in most of the time lately, but we haven't been able to score.
At last the red light outside the gate lit.
We knew Minsk would be loaded for the game, and he would try, and that's what happened.
The game in most became a defining game, and the winning goal we scored was in unequal composition.
We managed to have a good third period today, despite the fact that we missed an early goal in that segment and it was clear that it would not be easy in the future.
But we played very well in the defence, we didn't give a lot of chances to the opponent, we didn't get caught on shifts, Dinmo didn't have a numerically advantaged attack, so it ended well for us, and that's what Hartley's press club said.

Ilon Musk has to resign as head of the Board of Directors of Tesla
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Musk settled their dispute in the fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, as part of the agreement, the Mask will have to resign as head of the Board of Directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Mask to retain the post of leader of Tesla.
It is reported that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be recovered from Tesla.
However, money is distributed to affected investors.
In addition, the company is required to appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American entrepreneur who is one of the 50 richest people on the planet in the Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX Space Company, the Neuralink company and the developer of Tesla electric cars, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued the Director General of Tesla Ilon Musk because of his tweet message about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy out all stock at a fixed price of $420.
The stock value of $420 was allegedly set "because of the importance of this number in the crop of marijuana," previously reported by Bloomberg, referring to Stephen Paykin's Co-Director of the Security Department of the Commission.
At the same time, Ilon Musk later gave up his plans to buy the stock.
Commenting on the US Securities and Exchange Commission's suit against him, the businessman stated that he considered the charges of fraud to be groundless and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"The truth is the most important thing in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn't break it in any way," said a businessman in an interview with CNBC.
However, in August a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective suit against the Mask, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs argued that the businessman's posts had caused them a loss.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the businessman's tweets had been misled, making Tesla's shareholders forced to buy papers at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also pointed out that the reckless remarks made by Ilon Musk led to sharp exchange rate swings.
In September, Ilona Musk was accused of exchange fraud by the head of the Citron Research research company.
Meanwhile, if Musk had not been able to settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Board, he would have been threatened with being suspended from the company and even prison.
This was particularly reported by the former CNBC chairman of the commission, Harvey Pitt.
The mask is "a good guy who can't run a car company."

The RPT compared the possible renaming of the CPI with the actions of the Fascists
The head of the Department of External Church Relations (OCTS) of the Moscow Patriarchate of the Mythropolitan Volokolemski Ilarion compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of Nazis in Germany.
Mythropolitan Volocolomian Ilarion - about the causes of the conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchate, possible church division and its political connotation
According to him, now that "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage," renaming the church is as if in Nazi Germany "the Hebrews are wearing a yellow six-point star."
"It means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and that's what this bill was for," said the RPT broadcaster on Russia 24 TV.
The Mitropolitan police also stressed that the UCP is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, because "the faithful believe that they are Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country."

As a result of our meeting with auto-producers, it is in the near future that the creation of the Russian Formula One, which has no analogue in the world, is expected, said Dmitri Kozak.
We have to encourage our car growers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I don't think it's possible at that point.
I think a more realistic time frame is within the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014 the "Marous" team performed under Russian license in Formula One.
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors who are willing to invest in the creation of a national team in the World Auto racing championship in the Formula One class.
I know that there are car sports fans in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, ready to invest in creating a Russian team called Formula One, he remarked.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team has come about, too, because Sochi has such an infrastructure."
The Sochi Autodrome is waiting tomorrow.
According to Dmitri Kozak, the organisers were able to sell all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even at the grade level, it was almost filled,' remarked the vice-premier.
I can tell you that this year's revenue went up by 72 percent compared to last year.
It's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing a plan of action to improve the efficiency of the Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
It'll be an extra tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dimitri Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian motorists were the return of Daniel Kwait to the Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him success next season,' said the vice-premier to the news.
He's a very hopeful driver.
Next year, for the first time in history, Formula 1 will be able to take part in the two main Russian pilots.
Though the future of Sergei Orotkin in the Royal Races remains unknown.
His contract with William's ends at the end of the season, and the results are not astonishing as he is ranked 18th in the Russian Grand Prix.
Let's hope next season there will be more of our main pilots than this year, said Dmitri Kozak.

The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of an era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming world glory and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, extracting penicillin from mold mushrooms wasn't Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, he had been cold, sowing his own nose into a Petri cup, such a glass lid in which he was experimenting with the microbials, and a few days later he found out that the microbials there had been destroyed.
They found penicillin almost as accidentally as they did.

When Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945 shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, the Paris newspapers wrote, "For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions."

Alexander Fleming died of a heart attack in his home in London in 1955.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London Cathedral of St. Paul.

By the way, this, in my view, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there in Madrid, but at a different time and not at all about it.

"I didn't quit anything," stressed the President.

The Hollywood star Gwinette Paltrow ("The Ivy Man," "The Loved Shakespeare") married Producer Brad Falczak.
Although rumours of their wedding had been going on since April, the couple had officially concluded only now, on 29 September.
According to People magazine, a private ceremony took place at Paltrow's house in Long Island.

Business Insider reports that payments will increase to $12 billion next year.
Last year, Google paid $3 billion for this option.

At the beginning of August, Apple became the first US company to capitalize $1 billion.
The previously published accounts show that the corporate net revenue in the third quarter increased by 32 per cent over the same period in 2017, reaching $11.5 billion.

They managed to take over the Spanish Embassa and to tear down the office of the British non-governmental organization Oxfam, which, according to Rubicon, was involved in a paedophilia scandal.

Will aspirin protect you from a stroke?
This is an information echo after the European Cardiologists' Congress,” replyed the Chief Cardiologist of the Central Bureau of the Russian Federation, President Nickit Lomakin.
There were reports that aspirin does not protect, in primary prevention, people with low risk of heart and vascular disease.
Professionals know that.
But it effectively protects against heart attacks and strokes in primary prevention in people with high risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as patients with ischemic heart disease or other atherosclerosis.
In these cases it remains a means No. 1.
Trump talked about "love" in Kim Chen Eun.
From mutual violence, the US and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's leaders almost got in love with each other, joked by Donald Trump.
US President Donald Trump made a good joke about his successes on the frontline of a resolution of the North Korean crisis.
Beginning with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now adjusted their relationships so much that they are hardly in love with each other, remarked the American President.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main challenge in foreign policy.
Trump remarked that Barack Obama's team had so started a relationship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that they couldn't even reach the country's leadership that they just couldn't take off the phone.
At that time the US and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House "pretty letters," remarked Trump.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work he was also cruel to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
But now their relationship has been refreshed so much that the leaders are "loving each other."
At the same time, Trump asked me not to take it literally and warned that the US media would interpret it as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to Pyongyang's recent halt to nuclear and missile testing and the closing of military sites.
All this is the merit of his administration, I'm sure the American President.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump lauded Kim Jong Eun from the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps that had been taken to de-escalate the tension.
However, Trump observed that the sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea would continue until the full deducularization of the Korean peninsula.
Singapore Talks

The positive results of the meeting were the end of the nuclear and missile tests of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the return to the United States of the remains of United States soldiers.
Along with that, other practical steps towards the deducularization of North Korea are still bouncing.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit the US had already sent a number of disarmament scenarios to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "Gangster".

Nice called for "the Russian language to be replaced with a Ukrainian product"
The Ukrainian children's writer and mother tongue purifier Laris Nice called for the removal of the Russian-speaking Moscow product and the Moscow language from Ukraine.
To do so she suggests a Ukrainian product -- a cultural wave, a cultural push.
Nice shared her views on the “advisability of expunging Russian in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian publication The Spectator.
She said that the corresponding Ukrainian product was now being prepared -- it was already eating and was continuing to grow.
In time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "moscow language," she's convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that Russian speech had previously been widely used on television and radio, but had hardly been left in public space.
However, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities against the use of Russian are, in its view, only “expanding the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Nice had previously shared her experience of maintaining a "Ukrainian-speaking regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she had been invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watsons bookshops, one of which was contacted by a cashier in Russian.
Without getting what it was, Nice threw the change at the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians she calls "language schizophrenia," urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of names.
Nice recently stated that the name Pink was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not avoid the anger of the writer: when she came and heard the employees talking to each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left with the door shut.
During the break, they had a manly conversation, and it brought fruit
"The Urala" defender, Denis Kulakov, was the winner of the "Arsenal" (2:1) in the 9th round of the Russian championship.
"Dennis, what do you think made you win?"
"I think we wanted to win more," quotes the official Ural website.
"So hard a game turned out, during the break they had a serious men's conversation, and it had borne fruit: they beat two balls and didn't miss it.
"You skipped a few games because of the damage you received at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today?"
"If it lasted 90 minutes, it's okay!
Actually, I felt good.
Maybe at the end a little shore of strength to keep it safe.
So the doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich of Koshniev led me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
"What do you think of the atmosphere in the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after victory and recovery, it's easier, and the mood in the community is good.
Now we've got a white stripe, though it was black at first.
You have to keep going and cheer the fans."
"Did you miss the game for the time you didn't go to the field?"
"There's this, a little bored, because the really, unpleasant situation has come out.
But once again, thanks to the physiotherapist and the doctors for getting on their feet.
Most importantly, we won and we cheered the fans.
And the rest is secondary."

In a referendum in Macedonia, violations were recorded
Four incidents of election law abuses were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental renaming agreement with Greece.
This was reported on Sunday by the Spokesman of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of the polling stations, there have been four incidents which have been resolved, he said.
At the polling station at the Lazo Angelovski Elementary School in Skopje, 22-year-old K.J. broke public order and calm, insulted citizens and assaulted police officers.
He was arrested and taken to the police station.
According to the MFA representative, all the intruders were immediately brought to police stations.
The Ministry had indicated that all abuses were being verified.
"The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can peacefully exercise their right to freely express their will.
We call upon citizens to observe the law and to refrain from any disturbance of public order and tranquillity or any interference with the secrecy of the vote," said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Citizens are asked to answer one question during the Sunday referendum, "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
On 17 June, the heads of the Macedonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which borders between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
This agreement should not only resolve a long-standing dispute about the name of the country, but also open the way to the North Atlantic Organization (NOTE) and the EU.
Head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Russia ' s decision to supply C-300 is a timely step
Russia's decision to supply S-300 anti-aircraft rocket systems to Syria is a timely step.
This opinion was expressed by the head of the Syrian Ministry of Internal Affairs, Walid Muallem, in an interview with the RT television channel, which aired on Sunday.
If we analyse the importance of protecting the Syrian sky, we will see that this is a sign of security and stability rather than of war.
I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very grateful for Russia's efforts in this regard," the Minister remarked.
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that C-300 was a defensive rather than offensive system and was intended to protect the Syrian sky.
Pashinian hopes to hold early elections to the Armenian Parliament in 2018
Parliament elections may take place in 2018, as declared by the Prime Minister of the country, Nicolas Pashinian.
"Perhaps before the end of the year," replied the head of government to the question of journalists about the timing of the event (click on Interfax).
Mr. Pashinian also did not rule out that "return people to the streets" to hold extraordinary elections if discussions with parliamentary forces failed.
But I'm determined to hold talks with the parliamentary forces.
I hope they are also committed to constructive dialogue,” quotes the premiere of the "New-Armese."
Nicolas Pashinian added that the early elections were a “people's demand” and part of the government's agenda, for which Parliament had voted.
A long-term vision of government, he said, was also necessary to attract investment and economic development.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Pashinian promised, upon his return to Yerevan, that he would begin “a dialogue with all the parliamentary and extra-parliamentary forces to discuss the time and conditions of the early elections”.
In the current Parliament, about half of the members of Parliament represent the opposition Mr. Pasinian of the Armenian Republic Party (RPA).

The charges against the Dutch MP are news.
The Mahachkala Soviet District Court held for two months a member of the Daguestan People's Assembly, Rajab Abdoulatipov, suspected of having participated in a criminal association that took the form of disability for bribes.
The "unknown" details of the investigation's findings were how, according to the Russian Investigative Committee's version, the younger brother of the former head of the Republic, Ramazán Abdoulatip Rajab Abdoulatip, had now contributed to criminal action by the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Sciences, Magomed Mahachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, in the course of the intelligence activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was found that Rajab Abdoulatip was lobbying for the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as the head of the Bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles.
The previous investigation of Magomed Mahachev, the other directors and officers of the Regional Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise under his authority had led to a criminal prosecution under article 210 (creating and participating in a criminal association using official status), article 290 (receipt of bribes by an organized group), article 292 (servatory fraud) and article 159 (major fraud) of the Criminal Code.
According to the investigation, in late 2013, Rajab Aboulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Mahachev and his accomplices in the fund's theft, joined their activities by joining the criminal community.
While in the position of Head of the Department of the Russian Federal Migration Service for Daguestan and having connections with State authorities and law enforcement agencies, and enjoying their relationship with the head of Daguestan, Rajab Abdoulatip, the investigators consider that “ensured the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with government officials to support the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his position as head of the federal prison, the Chief Bureau of the Medical and Social Expertise on the Republic of Daguestan, organized the illegal establishment of disability for citizens”.
Following the announcement of this information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Aboulatipov denied the charges against him.
"Of course, everything I'm accused of today is new to me, I'm not familiar with it at all," he said.
The court arrested a member of the Unite of Russia not for ten days before the charges were brought, as was the case with previous high-level officials in the Netherlands, but for two months immediately, as it contained article 210 of the Criminal Code.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much longer time to charge an investigation, up to 45 days from the moment of arrest.

In addition, according to the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for Tuesday, 2 October, and writes "Lenta.ru".
The day before, it was reported that the Serbian President had brought the military of the State into full alert because of the situation in Kosovo.
This is the case last Friday, when a number of dozens of Kosovo's special forces entered the area adjacent to the lake supplying water to the Gazivode hydroelectric power plant.
It is clear that this power plant is located on the territory of Kosovar, but is also related to the Serbian power system.
Let us recall that Kosovar declared independence from Serbia 10 years ago, but in Belgrade this fact was refused.
Last spring the parties terminated their talks on this matter.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, Russia ' s negative theme was almost missing
The head of the Federation Council for International Affairs, Constantine Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a success for Russia, and does not rule out that it will be a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral part of solving global problems.
"The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric that we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with respect to Russia has now been more suppressed," said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation had sometimes “noted as one of the three main threats to humanity, but, in addition to the Ebola fever, Russia had been in this category, in any case, as a group of Western countries, which had expressed itself quite unanimity in this regard”.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed that "the topic of Russia was almost non-existent."
"If you carefully analyse the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at any rate, the chorus was not quite accurate," the politician remarked that Russia "was no longer a wall that was being trained by a tennis ball."
The head of the Sovfed's relevant committee does not rule out that this indicates a tendency which he considers to be “shall highlight the current session [of the UN [Honsassemble], although this tendency may occur in a year, in two or three years' time”.
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some way be a turning point," said Kosachev, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia can move forward in international affairs with its connection."
He gave an example of the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will be demanded over time," added the Parliamentarian.
This is because he believes that there is an “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible -- an integral part in solving the global problems of our time”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have the feeling that we're going through somewhere where movement will no longer be backwards, it'll be a forward movement," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context was called the "request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I have attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, and I have had my own meetings with great pleasure, and I have seen that, if a year or two or five years ago by Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is going on in the world, in large measure, no one was interested, the situation is different," said the Chairman of the Sovfed Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “there is no answer in the so-called new liberal order that represents the West on how to deal with the world's problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the problems of migration”.
"And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more apparent," said Kosachev's confidence, highlighting that in this sense he considers "the current session is a good one for the Russian delegation's work, a good one for Russia."

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that military force will not be required in the Syrian Province of Idlib, has been declared by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
However, he said that Syria was entitled to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had an opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the withdrawal of the Russian-prohibited organization Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports the RlA News.
The head of MIDA also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the areas east of Euphrates if the Kurds wanted separatism.
At the same time, Muallem believed that the talks with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until the US interrupted.
On 17 September, Poetin and the President of Turkey, Recep Erdogan, agreed to establish by 15 October a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian Province of Idlib.
Terry led the Chelsey youth team.
It was previously reported that a 37-year-old defender had been engaged in discussions on the transition to the Moscow Spartak.
According to the RT, with reference to Mirror, former Captain John Terry of England led the Chelsey youth team.
According to the source, a famous player who has long been a member of the London Club will run a team at least 23 years of age.
It is reported that at the coach's office, Terry will replace Jody Morris, who left for Durby County.
Remember, in September, Terry was close to moving to Moscow's Spartak, but eventually gave up the idea after talking to his family.
The First Vice-Speaker of the Upper Soviet Council, Irina Geraschenko, apologized to the convicted Russian national for the "spionage" of a Ukrainian journalist, Roman Sushchenko, for having not yet managed to release him from prison.
She spoke of this in a video address to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko FSB.
She said that in those days an action was taking place under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, which had declared a hungry protest demanding the release of the Kremlin's prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural leaders, among them, are hungry, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview where the President of Ukraine, Ukrainian power, all of us, have demanded pressure on the Kremlin, exert pressure on Poetin with one demand: the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those children who are being held illegally in the occupied areas of Donbassa and Crimea,” said Heraschenko.
It also expressed confidence that testing would stab every Ukrainian, making us “more angry, harder in defending Ukraine's national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what good is and what evil is”.
Recall that the Ukrinform correspondent in France, Roman Sushchenko, was arrested by Russian soldiers on September 30, 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October he was charged with spying on the General Department of Security of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years' maximum-regime colony, and the Russian Supreme Court found the verdict to be legal.
Russian prison guards granted the last request of the Ukrainian before he was brought to prison.
NASA reported an asteroid approaching the Earth the size of Big Ben.
The US space agency NASA has reported that a large asteroid SP1 approaching the Earth, which may be about 160 m long.
According to Daily Press, a space object may exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or the London wheel of view.
However, no exact data are available on its size.
The speed at which SP1 is moving is about 60,000 km/h. The smallest distance between asteroid and Earth will be on October 3.
It will then pass our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first observed on 19 September.
NASA listed it as a near-Earth object.
Earlier, on September 27, the Japanese Aeronautical Research Agency published the first ever video from the Rugu asteroid's surface.
Two Japanese Rovers, launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe, managed to extract unique frames.
The foul of the football lawn of the CM-2018 Stadium was attributed to Baste
The damage to the football lawn at Rostov-on-Donu stadium was linked to a concert by Russian rapper Vasily Vakulenko, or Basta.
Photo published at the Instagram account hd7tv.
"We're very good at Basta and his creativity, but... sorry for the lawn," says the signature to the photos.
The comments alleged that the protective cover (special tiles) caused damage to grass at the edge of the field.
The concert, scheduled to be held on 29 September, was never cancelled.
The Rustov Football Club, as well as the Russian Prime League, were opposed to the concert.
"I want to know the names of those football players and Rostau, who claim that my performance can damage, interfere with the performance and development of the football club, as well as affect the performance of its players," wrote Basta in response to criticism.
Rostow Arena is one of the world championship stadiums in the 2018 World Cup.
It held five games.
Poetin congratulated Hamilton on winning the Russian Formula 1 Grand Prix.

The agreement with the group of companies, Formula-1, provides for the Russian Grand Prix to be held every year from 2014 to 2025.
"I couldn't even hold a spoon."
Wahtang Kikabide for the fight against cancer
Nowadays, many artists talk about how they managed to cope with cancer.
The disease unfortunately spares no one, and the stories of popular people winning cancer give hope to many sick people.
A famous actor, Vahtang Kikabidze, confessed that he was only alive because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
"I feel like I've been hit with a hammer down my skull.
I fell.
Lost his orientation.
They put it in the hospital.
There couldn't keep the spoon, could not stand, fell all the time.
They started doing tests, it turns out it's bad, the artery doesn't miss blood.
They brought me to Moscow, and they said that I had a big filth cyst in my head, and they had an urgent operation.
And during the surgery, the doctors after the cyst saw a swelling," said the Kickabidze in the "One Day" program.
The swelling turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the inhabitants of Tbilisi even came to say good-bye to the idol at his doorstep.
But the actor's wife didn't let a live actor be buried, and she believed that she would be able to cope with the illness and had not left bed for over a year with her beloved husband.
If it wasn't for Irina, I'd be gone right now.
Always when I had a critical situation, she was there like a rock," the actor confessed.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, and now he lives happily in his home in central Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumours of his illness, and of the untimely death that comes on the web.
The designers of the Peacemaker site put Peter Sielarto, the Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, under the "Purgatory" section.
The policy was to "attempt Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the neighbouring country was found guilty of “direct threats of invasion of Ukraine” and of “support for secessionist sentiments in Ukraine” and of participating in “in the organization of an act of incitement directed at the mass violation by citizens of Ukraine of Ukrainian law”.
Let's note that the vice-director of Kievo-Pecher's Lavra Pavel and the leader of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) Onufriy had arrived in front of Cijarto in the Purge.
The result was their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, in commenting on the issue of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine in Zacarpatia, the President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities have named the sum of the gold parachute of the Vorones' quarterback.
The only 23 salary payments made by the deputy governor of the Voronego region, Yuri Agibalov, were made under the Regional Public Positions Act.
However, the real amount of the gold parachute released from the office of Vrio was somewhat less than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations were provided by the Regional Government Press Service.
According to the law, the salary for the office of Agibialov is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, in the press, the lump sum was 223,892 roubles less income tax, rather than the 1 million roubles reported by the media.
He had received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
He has been in public office for more than nine years.
This pension and a lump-sum payment are granted immediately upon dismissal, as explained to RIA News in the government of the region.
At the same time, the payment of supplemental payments to Agibilov was suspended on appointment to the State, and his salary remained unchanged from the previous period.
The winner of the governor's election, Vrio the governor of the region, Alexander Gooseev, took office on 15 September.
Aguibalov was dismissed on the expiry of the term of office of the head of the region.
Likewise, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region have ended.
On September 29, Telegram Channel Nesigar published documents which showed that Agibilov, who had resigned from his position as vice-governor, had paid a termination payment of 23 salary and two days later he had again received a similar post without a vrio.
The state's deputy called for students to be informed of the harm of masturbation.
Otshchenko holds the post of First Vice Chairman of the Education and Science Committee.
On the basis of his experience, he observed in an interview that young people are provoking masturbation through the bad information they find online.
It was at the level of educational institutions and the family, and he added.
Gennady Oneshchenko, MP of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with Radio Voice Moscow):
As part of the general sex education of children, this must be done by explaining the harm caused, because there is a risk to the sexual health of a child, both boys and girls.
The problem is objective; it is that children's maturity is early enough, and there are large scissors between their sexual maturity and the ability to officially contact intersex.
In the view of Otishchenko, the problem is prevented by “faithfulness”, by the silence of “sexual age” and by the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers face masturbation.
It is the view of the MP that teaching about the harm of masturbation is first found in schools in hyperurbanized regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Islamic Republic, you and I will simply not be understood, to say the least," said the professor.
Genady Onishchenko is an active RAMN academic, a member of the Bureau of RAMN, a doctor of medicine, a professor.
Received doctor of Russia and of Kirgistan, member of the Bureau of the Russian Public Association of the League of Public Health.
The families of those killed in Ishmilovsk will be helped by the Thermostele.
The warmth will provide assistance to the families of the victims during a pipe break in the Ismail Avenue.
The family was told about it in the company immediately after the tragedy.
Recall that the pipe in the yard of the house on the Ismail Avenue occurred on September 28th.
As a result of the tragedy, several cars collapsed under asphalt, and two young people died on the spot of burns.
ADH became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" scores another popularity record, while the ratings of Angels Merkel fall.
It seems that the Germans began to become seriously tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most notably, recent social studies have shown that the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming more popular and that the positions of the ruling bloc of Merkel and Zeehofer are becoming weaker.
This week, ADH broke another record, rising to number two in popular sympathy ratings.
Right-wing conservatories with 17 percent popularity have managed to bypass social democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to statistical error, but it cannot be overlooked that the ADH of a small group of European economists created in 2013 has become a serious political force.
The overall leadership has so far continued to hold the HCC/HDZ ruler block, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a marked tendency to lose points -- back in April, the support for the Angela Mercel bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Nowadays, 48 percent of Germans are in support of Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
In addition, the social democrats were followed by green (15%), left (11%) and liberals (10%).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The "Alternative for Germany" party was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Choice 2013" group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group was initially in opposition to government policy, but in the first place it was dealing only with economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's “support” of weak EU economies, and did not rule out the possibility of returning to the German mark and completely leaving the European Union.
With the deepening immigration crisis, the ADH political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took over the euro-skeptics and began to criticize the government severely for failing immigration policies.
At the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the ADH was able to get into the Bondestague for the first time, winning 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" get a seat in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens a "nature of fools"
He played a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books, Osp Drosdov, on live television, confessed that he considered his countrymen to be "a hunch."
They believe TV and don't read much.
As Drosdov has pointed out, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We haven't been taught a culture of reading or accepting text since we were kids," said a journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drosdov's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Television and Radio Committee of the Independent People ' s Republic of Korea has begun to combat literature, which contains the slightest hints of criticism of the Kiev authorities, and has prohibited the import of as many as 201 publications.
"Monchester City" beat Briton and became leader of the APL.
At the seventh round of England's Manchester City championship, Briton won a score of 2:0 in his field.
At the winners of the meeting, Raheem Sterling and Sergei Aguiero scored with their voices, beating the ball for the 29th and 65th minutes respectively.
"Monchester City," who knows no defeats, went to the 19th point at the top of the tournament table, passing one point over to the Liverpool, which today plays with Chelsey, and Briton put it on the 15th line, having five points in the asset.
On the next round, the guards of Josepa Guardia will play with Liverpool on their way out on October 7th, and the Chakeys will take West Ham two days earlier.
Canadians built a car in case of apocalypse -- driving magazine
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Roshel Defence Solutions stated that it was already accepting applications for its new armour.
Rocel Senator APC Apocalypse Armor
The theme of the apocalypse is not just video games, video studios, and book publishers.
Now the new thing is being learned by car companies.
For example, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its armored Apocalypse Senator APC.
In a fantasy-free time, this company's engineers are creating armoured cars for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are placed in a full-warm armoured container, without being particularly comfortable, but safely.
This bin is not a design, because it is reserved for B7 and is installed on the chassis of a strong Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armoured, is capable of protecting the capsule from rocket and anti-personnel mines.
Rocel Senator APC Armored Handle
In order to prevent passengers from being hit by even an explosion caused by a bursting projectile near the car, the car's cabin is fitted with special depreciation chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous venting and fire-fighting system.
For a secure view, the Rosel Senator APC is equipped with a camera system with a night vision function and a armoured viewing tower on the roof.
No weapons in the car.
Front of the armoured apocalypse
In order to prevent the heavy weight of the armoured car from affecting its mobility, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbodies engine of 6.7 litre, with the power transferred to the four wheels of the armoured vehicle through a 6-step automatic transmission.
There's no chance of getting stuck in the armored apocalypse of Roshel Senator APC
A special exhibition in Washington, D.C., will be held in October to see the armoured apocalypse of the Roshel Senator APC.
Named the time of death of the universe
The universe is still about 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world that is observed, about 13.8 billion years.
A study of an international team of scientists is published in the electronics library arXiv.org and is being published in the Journal of the Atomic Society of Japan, reported by the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
This was the case with the HSC (Hyper Supplement-Cam) telescope Subaru in about 10 million galaxies.
After tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the world's observed energy, scientists, working under the standard cosmological model CDM (the Cold Dark Matter), rated the evolution of the universe, which was a bit slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Subaru observatory notes that observations have provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, while the European Space Telescope Planck has clarified the limitations placed on the parameters of CDM.
In July, scientists modelled the possible destruction of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments to the effect that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the great gap.
Another attempt was made to merge the initiators of the pension referendum
The possibility of learning people's opinion on pension reform is delayed indefinitely.
On Saturday, Moscow held a meeting of a general federal initiative group against raising the retirement age.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that had registered various language issues (the Centre had registered five).
They decided to apply to the CEC for registration of a single initiative group and to ask the Russians, "Would you like the age set by the pension law as of 1 July 2018, at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old age pension, not to be raised?"
This language was registered by a sub-group of birds, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but which was considered to be the most simple and legal vessel.
The majority of the participants were members of Ilya Swiridov's Fair Russia (six sub-groups) and PRRA (four sub-groups).
Three independent sub-groups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg, joined.
Sviridov had previously said to the “Messages” that invitations had been sent to all initiators and that some 40 sub-groups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenov, who was chairing the sub-group of water, (her wording was supported by another 15 sub-groups), said, "We have not received or planned to come, "We have not understood who the friend is and who the enemy is."
Blues singer Otis Rush died
At the age of 84, a famous Chicago blues player and singer, Otis Rush, died, reporting to AP, referring to his manager Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following a stroke carried out in 2003.
Mr. Rush's creativity influenced musicians such as Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.
He gained a lot of credit in 1956 after the release of the song "I Can't Quit You Baby", which took the sixth line of the Billboard R&B rating.
The admiral has caused us great problems.
Zinethula Bileletdinov: "Admiral" has caused us great problems.
The Chief Trainer of Ak Barsa, Zinethula Bieletdinov, summed up the results of the regular KHL match against the "Addmiral" (4:2).
"The hard game was, complicated.
The rival fought well, caused us great problems.
I'm glad we played well in most of the game today.
I've already told you that someday, the goal will come, and all that matters is that we work on it.
And that we won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zarripov a break in this series?"
"We have our own program on which it works.
So there was this solution," quotes the club's Billalettin Press Service.
Ilon Musk will retire as head of the Board of Directors of Tesla
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk will be required to leave the board of directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
At the same time, a businessman will retain the position of Chief Executive Director of the company, reports AFP with a reference to the controller's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Earlier, the governor had sued Ilon Musk -- officials thought he had misled Tesla's investors because the businessman had allowed the purchase of all company shares at a high price -- $420 for paper.
In the Loko match, "Ahmat" Turbine's mistakes were falling out of the ear of abundance.
Former U.S. judge Vladimir Levitin spoke about the work of Arbitrator Evgeny Turbine in the 9th round of the Russian Locomotive, "Ahmat", and addressed the disputed episodes of the game.
- How do you judge Eugenius Turbine in a Locomotive match?
- I believe this arbiter has confirmed that he is not eligible for trial by the Russian premiere league.
I am surprised that the pressure of the fifth round of "Spartake" - "Dinamo," neither Turbine nor the leaders of the DCI have drawn serious conclusions about his low skill.
The result had not slowed down in the ninth round: errors in its actions, private skipping of rough tactics had scurried out of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute, the railroadman, Eder, with his hands, is hurled down in his fine square by the defender of the "Achmata" Rodolfo.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbine doesn't put a penalty on it.
How do you rate the episode of Idov's participation, which was at the 82nd minute when it seemed like a ball hit his arm?
- I think it was a premeditated defender's hand game in his fine square.
Turbine was right next to the moment, and he could see the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep, and the penalty was not set.
So the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice has been compromised.
This was the very case where the judge's notions pushed out and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
At the 52nd minute Turbine did not decide to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who had broken the rules in his struggle with the Krikhovian, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second mustard?
At this point Turbine and the first yellow card showed up not quite on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after a match about double standards of justice that some teams are being punished for abuses such as the Idawi episode and some others are not.
What do you think a football player says?
- Depends on what to mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give it.
So the arbiter doesn't give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
Here's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge watches who plays.
This Saturday was a Locomotive game and Akmat has serious concerns about Turbin's work because the team has been compromised.
Matt Damon played the accused for raping Judge Cavanaugh at the start of the SNL.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the United States High Court of Justice, Britta Cavanaugh, who is accused of being raped.
The first episode of the new season, "Saturday Night Live", was released on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at the senate hearing on charges of rape.
A candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailed stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Clobushar.
For example, Cavanaugh repeatedly confessed to his love for beer, but stated that he had never been drunk to memorylessness.
Moreover, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Cavanaugh claimed that he had been a virgin in those years.
These moments were also played by damon.
All I did was drink a lot and don't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows it," said the judge in the execution of Matt Damon.
Cavanaugh had previously been elected Chief Justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found her cloned dogs strange in behavior.
The American singer Barbra Streisand stated that the clones of her dead dog behave quite differently than the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
Actually, [clons] look like her, but it's impossible to clone a soul," stressed a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Straisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog a coton de toulear named Samanta, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua dog called Miracle Milli, the world's smallest dog, was cloned for the forty-nineth time.
Professionals are trying to clone a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The US thought about Russia's sea-lock because of oil and gas supplies.
In the US, Russia may be under a sea-lock to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The American authorities are so eager to fight for success in the world hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the Russian maritime siege, which remains one of the world's main energy providers.
On the previous day, Mr. Ryan Zinke, head of the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs, spoke of the possibility of a sea siege.
Contrary to global practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior performs civil rather than police functions, including natural resource policies.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came within the competence of the agency he led, although it was not without political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinck said that the US Navy controlled the maritime routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
From Zinke's words it was understood that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supply to the world energy market.
Zinke reminded us that Russia continues to earn a lion's share of its revenue from the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main reason for Moscow's activation in the region, I believe Zinke.
The minister has made it clear that the US is still looking for leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest oil and gas provider.
To do so, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the sea-locking trade routes, an appropriate measure in that direction, he thinks, is Zinke.
The Kalmian director received good feedback from the festival
Our landlord, the actor of the Gogol Center, Yevgeny Sangajiev, and his film "Harmony" were given a special mention by the jury of the sixth "Movement" debut festival, which was held in Omsk.
The name of the festival degree states that "this is a signal for the immediate response of large industrial players to the film."
As you know, a picture of a young Kalmian director was presented in a short film program called "Move, Beginning", where eight movies took part.
The main prize in this competition program was the painting "Ianna is Anja the contrary" -- the director's debut of actress Jan Glady.
The focus of the National Film Festival for the Debut of "The Movement" is on a young film, not in terms of age, but in terms of their spirit, desire, and ability to risk.
And P. Chonkoszov, a graduate of the Evgeniy Sangajeev School of Arts, and RATl-GlllSYSYS, meet all these requirements.
He's young, talented, creative, and in his creativity he's looking for new non-standard forms of expression.

The island region's doctors encourage the inhabitants to be more active and not to ignore the doctor's advice.
Vaccination coverage is expected to reach 219,000 inhabitants this year, including at least 70 per cent of all children.

Supersound passenger aircraft in the Russian Federation will be supplied for serial production
The production of supersonic passenger planes in Russia will begin after 1930.
This was announced by the Director-General of the Central Aerodynamic Institute of the Zhukovski Kiril Sipalo.
He said that the Centre was working on supersonic issues both in international consortia and in cooperation with the Minprompromtoria.
"It will take us two or three years to get a technology demonstration, and 10 or 15 years to get a serial car that allows for transport around our home country," he added.
He explained that the question now before Russian experts was how to make technology cost-effective and safe at the same time.
At the beginning of September, the PAO developer, Tupolev, declared that the pre-project work on a supersound passenger aircraft had been completed, and it was estimated that the aircraft would be able to speed up to 1,900 km/h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was reported by the Vice-Director of Valery Solozov.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, thanked Russian President Vladimir Poetin for making Ukraine more European.
He announced this on CNN.
He stated that he could only confirm the words of the columnist Washington Post that the result of Poetin's aggression against Ukraine had been the unification of Ukrainians.
"In 2013, Ukraine's trans-Atlantic integration and its accession to NATO supported 16% of Ukrainians.
Now it's over 54%.
Who did this?
Poetin.
In 2013, European integration of Ukraine and accession to the EU supported 33% of Ukrainians.
It's 73% now.
Who did this?
Poetchenko said.
So thank you, Mr. Poetin, for making my country much more European and much more ready to defend European and trans-Atlantic values.
And we are absolutely sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire," stressed the President of Ukraine.
In late September 2018, President Peter Poroshenko was in the United States and took part in the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly.
He also visited the grave of a great friend of Ukraine, Senator John McCain of the United States (1987-2018).

Formula One Russian Grand Prix
There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former captain of the Chelsey and the England team, John Terry, who had attended the 9th round of the Russian Spartack-Rostau championship (0:1).
"I've got a club in Russia that I'm following.
I've been watching quite recently, and I was curious to see him from outside.
I can't say I'm a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsey, but I have sympathy for Spartak and I want to apologize again for the decision, and that's what the "Chelsey" fan site says.
Remember, Rostau, with 18 points, went to third place in the tournament table, and Spartak, on the fifth line, had 15 points in stock.
Next round, the red-and-white ones on October 7th will be playing with Enicey, and the tutors of Valeria Carpine will take Orenburg the day before.
The expensive violin was put in a pawn shop for a priceless price.
When an LBC Boutique and Loan pawn shop in Somerville, Massachusetts, brought a violin, an old and unimaginable tool, an employee of the pawn shop offered only $50.
But the experienced manager of the shop, dylan Mcdermitt, suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and asked for advice from an expert.
So it turns out that the violin was manufactured in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinand Galliano and valued at 250,000 dollars.
Only the violin connections are estimated to be between $16,000 and $18,000.
The investigation found that the violin had recently been kidnapped from one of the city's inhabitants and the tool had been returned to the rightful owner.
It is not known how the violin got to the man who handed it over to the pawnbar, but was not followed by any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that everyone bringing a violin to the pawn shop will now be asked to play it to make sure that it actually belongs to a client.
In the 9th round of the RPL, we're about to face an exciting struggle: "Spartake" will be hosted at its Stadium in Tushin "Rostov" under the leadership of Valeria Carpin, a man known to be not a stranger to the "people's team."
And what makes the meeting particularly picky is that the clubs now have an equal score of 15 points, and they divide 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, falling behind the far-reaching Zenith, and being in the same room as the Reddoder, who is playing with Dinamo tomorrow.
The red-and-white people now have a difficult strip: the club is surrounded again by idiotic scandals, and in the European League, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly flew in "Rapidou," and recently gave up the house "Ahmata."
After the Derby with the SCA, which ended with a fair tie, Spartak won the Black Sea Cup with a minimum of effort, and it is too early to say whether Russia's most popular club is approaching the crisis.
The Rostau three games in a row couldn't win, but the defeats don't even know five games.
Let's see if Carpin can extend the winning series with such a principled match.
The previous meeting between the Karpin Rostau and Spartak ended in favour of the capital team.
Start at 7:00.
Indonesia is shaken by post-tsunami post-tsunami shock
In Indonesia, where an earthquake occurred a few days ago that triggered a three-metre-long earthquake, meteorologists are witnessing more than 170 post-shocks.
The Magnitude was 7,4, mostly affecting the island of Sulawesi, reported by Russia 24 TV.
More than 420 people died and over 500 were injured.
The authorities had notified the population of the disaster beforehand, but had later cancelled it.
The thing is, the devices didn't detect a wave approaching.
The fate of dozens more people who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday on one of the coastlines of Palau, most affected by the destruction after the natural disaster, is still unknown.
London broke out with charges against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the cold war, as declared by the British Defence Minister, Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the Conservative Party's convention in Birmingham.
More and more threats, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, and enemies are operating in grey areas with cyberattacks and false news, added the Minister.
But the biggest one is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians have been repeatedly denied by Moscow, and they are submitted to the TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not follow international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March this year by ex-colonel Sergey Scripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum is being held to join the European Union and the United Nations Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute with neighbouring Greece over the name of a country that matches the name of a neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first votes was made by Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, a keen supporter of the renaming of the Republic to Northern Macedonia.
The preparations for the referendum and today's vote are monitored by international organizations.
The head of the observation mission of the Office for Democratic Institutes and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers was organized:
About 100 teams travelled around the country to monitor the process today, from the opening of polling stations to the closing of polling stations, then the counting of votes and the writing of protocols.
For a month, 10 of our teams have been working in the country to monitor preparations for the vote, the media, the law on the financing of elections and the organization of a referendum.
Faye Dulgeri: "Around 500 foreign observers follow the voting closely.
Observer groups shall record in detail what is going on and communicate with the members of the election commissions in order to make them available in the final report.
Translator compared the mentality of Russians to Germans
The mentalities of Russian and German people are different, but the few differences between them do not play a great role in understanding.
On 30 September, the International Translator's Day was told by the professional synchronist Burbel Sakes.
She has been translating Russian and English for over 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan things quietly, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "the long-running, the fast-walking."
But it seems to me that for people to understand and for translators to work it doesn't matter," said the specialist in the comment "RlA News."
According to the interpreter, in order to understand that two countries need each other, it's enough to know history.
And in the future, Saxe said, Germany doesn't need to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, and there's no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny," she said.
The previous day, German chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country was trying to “connect” with Russia and maintain it.
She said that for Berlin the Northern Flow 2 gas pipeline, which is built from the coast of Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is particularly important.

"The night was cold, the next night wasn't honey, either, but I hope sunny day compensates my house trousers and so early evening bubbles," remarked Didenko for her prediction, felicitating the Ukrainians with a holiday--the day of holy faith, hope, love, and mother of their Sofia.
Remember, the previous nights were marked by freezes on the ground in the western and northern regions of Ukraine, as well as in the Winnitz region.
Poetin has appointed a new head of the President's Office for External Policy
Vladimir Poetin was executor of Alexander Manjosin's office as head of the President's Office for External Policy.
Instead of him, Igor Neverov was appointed to this post.
Mr. Mangosin has been running the President's Office for External Policy since 2004.
One of the reasons why he left near the Kremlin's source referred to personal circumstances, noting that there were no substantial claims for the quality of the work on the head of management.
Igor Neverov had previously been head of the Second European Department of MIDA.
In 2009 - 2014 he was a Russian ambassador to Sweden.
Russians donated one ruble for a low-wage MP
In Yekaterinburg, the People's Charitable Foundation opened a fund-raising campaign for a member of the State Duma of Vera Gansi, who complained of low wages.
The campaign can be tracked on the organization's website.
The People's Charitable Foundation hopes that the whole world will be able to save the servant of the people.
Let's ask all interested people to give us a chance to live and a happy future!
All collected funds will be transferred directly to the poor.
God save you!" said the foundation.
A total of 380,000 rubles are being collected for the deputy, which is the equivalent of a month's salary.
Reports of the assistance received are published on the Vkontact page of the foundation, where the organisers produce screenshots of remittances.
The most common amounts are one ruble and 50 kopecks.
By the time the note was published, Russians had donated 1633 rubles to Vera Hanse.
The fund-raising opened on 28 September following a low-income complaint by Ghana.
She said that the average salary of the deputy was 380,000 roubles, from which nothing remained, and therefore had to be spent on a credit card.
Ganjia visited that Parliamentarians were not paid for hospitality.
Subsequently, the State Duma announced that it would consider the possibility of paying representation costs to the MPs.
"The Golden Shake" of the San Sebastian Festival received a film called "The Between the Two Seas"
The painting "The Between the Seas" (Entree dos aguas) by the Spanish director Isaki Lacuesta was recognized as the best film at the 66th International Film Festival in San Sebastian.
The tape won the main prize of the festival, the Golden Spin.
Norwegian actress Pia Tielt won the Silver Splash Prize as the best actress for the Blue Spot.
The best actor was named Dario Grandinetti, Argentina, for the film "Red" (Rojo).
The director of the same film, Benjamin Ney state, won the title of the best director.
"The Night School" comedy was led by an American box office.
The evening school comedy, which debuted in American movie theaters last Friday, earned 28 million dollars for its first weekend.
This result allowed an unthinkable picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the United States box office from 28 to 30 September.
On the international market, the film, which had so far been released in only 20 countries, had raised $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable, has been quite appreciablely ahead of another new Western roller, a cartoon called "Smallfoot," a curious history of meeting a charming Bigfoot with a human being whose existence the main character never believed in.
The Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig's project for their start-up weekend raised 23 million dollars, generally meeting the expectations of experts who predicted 20-25 million ribbons for the weekend.
With regard to the sum of Smolfoot, it now stands at $38.6 million (and it has debuted in 50 countries), the most active one being Mexico, which has filled the film's treasury by $3.6 million.
The three of the strongest this time was shut down by the children's tale "The Mystery at Home with Hours" by the horror master Eli Roth, who finally proved that the director was able to make a good movie for audience 12+.
In her second week of renting a screenshot of John Bellers' book with the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett made $12.5 million, bringing the world's total bill to 53.8 million.
Despite the flight from top three, it continues to surprise the "+" thriller with Blake Lively and Anne Kendrick with "Simple Request": in 17 days in the United States, a picture of Paul Fig, from which some unreal financial performance was not expected at all, raised $43 million (including $6.6 million for 28-30 October) and now has as much as $62.9 million in total revenue.
The last representative of the first five this week was the "The Curse of a Nonnanny" Horror, who collected $5.4 million during the reporting period.
Spin-off "The spells" has spent 24 days in American (and not only of course) cinemas earning $330 million, and recently proudly holds the title of the most successful film of the fraternity, which also includes two parts of the spell itself and two tapes on Annabel's creepy doll.
Just after Corin Hardy's horrors last weekend, another member of the genre, the debutant of the "Hellfest," was one of the main youth horrors of the year.
On his first weekend as a child of a famous engineer (and recently director), Gregory Plotkin, who had previously worked on a number of large Croatian projects, including the "Happy Death Day", on which Hellfest had a lot of resemblance, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is very positive.
The seventh was the "Perfectly Rich Asians" ($4,15 million), who seem not to be thinking of falling out of the top ten of the American box office: the romantic comedy that has been on the screen for the seventh week is the sixth highest score in the history of the highest score of 165.7 million.
This is the sum of the current picture in the domestic market: the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.
With regard to the last three lucky people in the United States for the month of 28-30 September, they were the hunter, the White Boy Rick, and the Blackmint, earning $3.7 million, $2.38 million and 1.1 million, respectively, over the past weekend.
Let's add that next weekend in the U.S., the long-awaited Vienna with Tom Hardy, who -- you can be sure of that -- will take over leadership in the United States box office on the first weekend of October.
From the other premiere of the coming week, we have to highlight the musical melodrama of "Star Born," the winner of the United States film festival by Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama of "Your Hate."

Valery Below: God has helped Siberia today.
Valery Below's Chief Trainer of the Vitamins, about the fall from Siberia (3:4) in the regular KFL championship.
"The colleague was talking about the Siberian fans, and I want to celebrate our fans," quotes the White official Whirlpool website.
"I hope they'll also support it, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, perhaps, God was helping Siberia today, because it was very gravely wrong, especially our leaders.
We've lost a small game of zero and three, so we've had a hard time getting out of this game, though we've had moments.
But still, I'll take the blame.
Because apparently we missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team."
"It's an ugly chimney."
The audience is outraged at Agustina's choice of voice show.
The audience of Voice 60+ blames Leonid Agustine's mentor for "abhorrent camouflage and brawl."
When in blind listening he first learned the voice of his father, Nikolai Agustina, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the performer.
But the son's feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative on his team.
At the time, many considered it a joke, but forgave the teacher the bias in the first step.
But the joke took a long time, and the star's father took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agustina for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, resented the shameful and frank dragging of our close relatives to the final staircase.
I've even doubted that Agustina would have the strength and the conscience not to drag his father to the top of the table,” Irina Petrovski and Xenia Larin reasoned in "The Man From TV."
Meanwhile, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutain "sung" beautiful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrevich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wanted to see his father in the show.
But as it turns out, that's not the case, the audience wants an objective evaluation, and they want to see really talented performers in the final, and now Agustin has discredited the show.
"I'm sorry for the members of the Agustina team, they were doomed."
"The last time Agustin showed him how much he liked Dad, he was supposed to be a professional today."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave their dad in the project who doesn't sing but whispers, how can you then call a mentor?"
"I like the way dad sings, make him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people come to this concert."
This is Voice Show, not Bloody Relatives Show.
"It was unprofessional from Agutain."
"Then you have to offer your own show to pope instead of the show that comes for Channel 1 money."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other player with real Vocal data.
Why did the Surgut worker with a great voice and a tembro leak and Father Agustina get to the finals?
And then we all complain that on the stage and on the screens, we've all had the same faces for decades!
Because you can't get through the chimney!"
"What were you waiting for?
That's Russia!
Around the blues and chimneys.
And we'll have money for the family budget!
The theatre of absurdity continues!"
The users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voice, a son of Gradsky had appeared at blind listening.
Then it never occurred to me to take my son on my own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, I get it."
Acutin couldn't do as a professional.
Canadian military allowed to wear beards to raise the spirit
The Department of Defence of Canada has issued an order that allows soldiers to wear beards.
According to CBC, the bill contains instructions on beard management.
It is observed that the military may order that they shave "for security reasons."
The military beard cannot be longer than 2 cm, nor must it be carefully trimmed, and the neck and cheekbones must be shaved.
At the same time, Navy officers were allowed to wear a beard only on land.
It is expected that the innovation will increase morale in the military and attract more Canadians to the service.
The ban on wearing beards has been in effect in the Canadian army since the Second World War.
It was previously reported that police officers in France were also allowed to wear beards and even to have tattoos.
At the same time, the court in Egypt supported the removal of police officers wearing beards.

In Russia, they'll start fines for infractions in the construction industry.
As of tomorrow, Russia will begin to be fined for infringements in the area of construction, and it will be broadcast to Russia 24.
The penalty is on the hands of companies and officials if they do not submit the building data to the Integrated Information System for the Construction of Accommodation on time.
The innovation will help those who choose to buy an apartment in a new building, but who are afraid of the developer's failure.
This was mentioned at a conference in St. Petersburg for the construction industry.
Due to the changes made to the law on equity construction, developers will have to lend their full credit to the bank.
And a lot of experts have already talked about the possibility of a large travel of apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.
In the centre of Kiev, a burglar threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to borrow money from the ATM.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 September in Ivan Kudry Street, reported by the police.
According to the victim, the unknown person came to him and started a conversation, but then suddenly grabbed the knife and demanded that he be given the money and cell phone.
Since the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered the withdrawal of the money from the bank card.
After the assailant had received 4,000 hryvnias and a telephone, he hit the victim and ran away," said the report.
The law enforcers managed to apprehend the robber, and they turned out to be a 25-year-old Quijavanian.
He now faces up to seven years' imprisonment.
The police are also working out a theory of the perpetrator's involvement in other such crimes.
Remember, the previous day there were several resonant robberies in Odessa.
In one case, armed robbers were caught using a dart.
A scientist spoke about a possible scientific program to explore the Russian Federation's voyage to the moon
The head of the RAN Institute for Space Research, RAN's correspondent, Anatoly Petrukowicz, told RIA News about a possible research programme for Russian spacemen on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was currently working on the direction of such work.
"Consolidated opinion not yet," underlined the scholar.
He said that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the Moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place that such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," said Petrukowicz.
He also believed that the Moon could be used to test robotics and use local resources for construction.
In addition, a scientist believes that astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on Earth.
This might help to determine how life emerges on planets.
Formerly, the head of Roscosmos said that the Russian Federation, in an optimistic way, could fly to the moon by the year 1930.
An offended client chucked out a fecal basket at the 7-Eleven store.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old Saint-Petersburger, called Florida, had a tooth on the manager of the 7-Eleven 24-hour network store: in May he threw him out of the store for inappropriate behaviour.
So he decided to take revenge on his enemy in the original way.
At half-second of the night he went into the store and threw it on the floor and on a piece of the shelf goods the contents of the basket which he had brought.
There were fecals and pee in the basket, which Simms "learned" from a nearby mobile bio-tool.
The police officers who arrived at the scene arrested the Avenger.
He was jailed and released on bail at $300.
He was charged with illegal intrusion into someone's property and criminal offence and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
While Simms' crime seems rather funny than serious, the sentence may be rather severe, as he has repeatedly broken the law: large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, drunk driving and cruelty to animals.
The U.S. called Russia's most formidable submarine
The most formidable enemy submarine to the US Navy will be the Russian sub-ship "Kasan" of the "Yasen-M" project, writes The National Interest.
The submarine was released in March 2017, but the Navy will take it into service in 2019.
According to the publication, even the pre-eminent Casani of the Northodwinski submarine was highly appreciated by the United States military.
We will face a severe potential adversary.
Just take a look at "Severodwinski," quotes The National Interest Counter-Admiral Dave Johnston.
At the same time, the publication states that the United States retains an advantage in this industry vis-à-vis Russia.
The multi-purpose Atomic Submarines of Casanus, Novosibirsk, Krasnojarsk and Arkhangelsk are built on an enhanced project of Yasen-M (885M).
They have a displacement of 13,800 tons, a depth of 520 metres, a crew of 64 persons, an autonomous 100 days, a submarine speed of 31 knots.
The submarines are armed with mines, torpedoes 533 mm, Onyx and Caliber rockets.
In August, U.S. Press announced that the U.S. Navy's U.S. submarine force remained "the most powerful and frightening force on the planet."
German politicians ignored the opening of the shrine because of Erdogan

Deutsche Welle writes about this.
The event was attended by the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Recker reported having received an informal invitation on the eve of the opening on Friday, 28 September.

Speaking in front of the Moslem, Erdogan summed up a two-day visit to Germany.
The President described them as successful, he said, and he was able to meet with President Frank-Walter Steinmeyer and chancellor Angela Merkel, who had been discussed, inter alia, against racism and Islamophobia.
The new church in Cologne has become one of the largest in Europe and has the potential to contain about 1.1 thousand faithful at the same time.
Construction cost 30 million euros, financed by the Turkish side.

There were two teams who had two defeats before the meeting.
It's a "tooth-tooth" thing.
Well played by a special team, throwing up two pucks.
You can see that the kids have a very large psychological load.
They're very hasty at the end of the attacks, so it's not working.
After that time, you have to go through and move on.

The U.S.A. found the identity and apprehended the owner of the Peugeot 301 car, who was travelling the previous day around the capital with a license plate of the so-called NPD.
It turned out to be a former employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who currently works as an agent of an insurance company in Ukraine.
According to the U.S. Press Centre, the detained person explained that the car had been wanted by Interpol since 2014 and was therefore arrested in Russia and handed over to him as a representative of the insurance company.
When he crossed the Ukrainian-Russian border, he removed his fake registration plates, but on entering Kiev he re-established them.
He said that he had done so “to ensure that registration numbers of a package of documents on a given car issued by the Russian Interpol officials were in line with the vehicle in case the vehicle was stopped for inspection by the Ukrainian police”.
“A set of measures is currently being implemented to verify the explanations provided, as well as to determine whether it may be involved in terrorist activities,” the ISA stated.

In the United States, a possible sea-lock was declared by Russia
The United States could, if necessary, impose a maritime ban on Russia in order to prevent its supply of energy to the countries of the Middle East.
The U.S. Home Secretary, Ryan Zinke, said so.
Addressing an industrial event in Pittsburgh, the head of government stated that the only source of income for the Russian economy was the sale of energy and Moscow had an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas, as it did in Europe, by Washington Examiner.
Zinke also said that the situation was similar to that of Iran.
In the view of the Minister, there are two options for a solution: military and economic.
He would prefer not to use the first, so pressure must be put on and Iranian energy must be removed.

Sergei Orothkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful
Sergei Orotkin, a Russian pilot of William's, comments on the results of the Russian Grand Prix.
"To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I ended up between two cars, which immediately jammed me.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
Turned out to be in a very bad position.
I'm stuck in traffic.
It was hoped that once the rest of us got to the pit stop, we'd get into the clean air and get back to the pace, but the rubber was gone.
Plus he fought with his partner, and he had contact with him too.
I take it he's a bit wrong.
We were in this situation on the slowest track of the season, and I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
"I don't want to talk about it any more," quotes Orokin's "News."
Remember, the Orotin race at the Russian Grand Prix ended on the 18th, and the winner was the British pilot of the "Mercedes" by Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called it absurd to suspend Glušakov and Jennko from the basis of "Spartak."
The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTP) Shamil Tarpeštov comments on the removal of the football players of the Moscow "Spartak" by Danis Glušakov and Andrey Jennko from training with their main members after the liquor on criticism of the Chief Trainer of the Massimo Carrera team, and reports "Sport Weekend".
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
Such a thing to pay attention to is an indistinguishable nonsense.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It only worsens the problem in the team.
First of all, these are poems, you can read and read them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted if I were Carrera.
Everybody's got a different opinion.
Second, everybody wants to get a good laugh.
If Glušakov and Jenko are liking, that doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And that doesn't serve the normal environment in the team.
Nowadays, the Spartak doesn't have a game, so it didn't have to be blown up at all.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
"Spartak" has a lot of problems in different ways, and it's an indignity once it's made up of young people.
Relationships within the team do not seem to add any optimism before this match," I'm sure Tarpshawk.
The game will take place on 30 September and will start at 7 p.m. Moscow time.
Formerly rejected "Spartake" by John Terry led the "Chelsey" youth team.
Sirius teachers discussed natural technologies with scientists.
The teachers of the Sirius Educational Centre in Sochi, a student at the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by researchers at the National Research Centre of the Curchatov Institute.
A presentation by researchers took place within the framework of a programme of the Global International Forum on Convergent and Environmental Technology, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Poetin, on the website of the educational centre on 29 September.
The lecture was opened by a documentary film entitled "Courchatov's Codes", during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, RAN's member Michael Kowalchuk, spoke about global challenges as a driving force for civilization.
The lecture is published on the Syrius website.
Schoolmates learned that modern technology needs huge amounts of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to generate such amounts.
This problem will be addressed, according to the organisers of the Forum, by the natural technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of natural technologies, as well as the risks inherent in the creation of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, a huge good.
It's an explosion of medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of natural technologies is actually a technological replication of animal systems.
There's a backside -- focused interference with human activity.
There are always risks.
There was a car, and people were dying under the wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I'm creating medical new technology and I can create weapons of mass destruction," quotes the scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and talking about modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask the participants questions.
Speakers included a candidate for physics and mathematics, the head of the Kurchatov Complex of NBlX-like Environmental Technology, the "Kurchatov Institute" of Iulia Diakov, and the head of the IBlX Complex of Technology, Viacheslav Demin.
The Sirius Educational Centre in Sochi was set up by the Talant and Success Educational Foundation, based on the Olympic infrastructure, at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Poetin.
The aim of the educational centre is to identify, develop and further professionally support gifted children.
Previously, in September, it was reported that the Internet Security Champions, an all-Russian online platform, would be sent to Sirius for training.
Air traffic controller saved a life-saving plane with passengers during an earthquake in Indonesia

Macedonia: No referendum due to low appearance
The referendum was intended to endorse an agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Baltic country as Northern Macedonia.
Greece objected to the Macedonians using the name of their historical province.
The renaming led the former Yugoslav Republic to open the way to the North Atlantic and later to the EU.
But, as EFE reports, only 34 percent of the Sunday's playlist was "not reached" by 50 percent of the constitutional threshold.
However, since the referendum was only of a consultative nature, the authorities in Skopje might decide not to abandon its renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closing of polling stations, the Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zayev, a supporter of the change in the name of the Republic, said that if there was more "yes" among the votes, Macedonia would change the name, regardless of the quota which had not been reached.

Kemerochan stirred up a herd of sheep at the cemetery
On September 30, the famous Kemerovo social network page received a report from a witness that a local cemetery was freely run by horned animals.
A large flock of animals passed between the fence and plucked the grass.
The commentators expressed different opinions: some local inhabitants said that there was no harm to the animals in the cemetery, and their appetite could even help to clear the area from weeds and grass, but some of the city's inhabitants did not enjoy animal behaviour:
"This is a grave, not a pasture.
There's nothing for the lambs to do there.
Of course, you can't say they're sacrificing, but it's not a matter of business." (Style saved) - remarked a furious Chemorian in her message.
In any case, one of the witnesses said that the animal problem in the middle of the cemetery was already known and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
To push and win is how right is it?
A word of pressure does not exist.
Right, right, right.
The word "press" in terms of "stress, influence, influence" exists only phonically, because we hear sound [a] instead of [o] in terms of "satisfaction."
We use that word because we think it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "satisfaction" are not only not close, but even in a way opposite.
Make sure you do.
Length (church.-book, obsolete) means "pleasant, full, sufficient, sufficient for anyone or anything, satisfied."
Satisfaction, pleasure is kinship.
He used to have the meaning of "do not depend on anything, have a self-satisfying meaning" -- "be content with yourself."
Old-Slawish Widow is related to the words "give" and "will."
Pushing, suppressing, it's completely different.
These words are really frightening "natives": daos is a "wolf" (repressing sheep), deyja is a "death" and dvaidė is a "attract."
A similar phonic form of the words "pressure" and "satisfaction" and the imminent obsolescence of the latter had led them to contaminate.
So we've got this very "d'a's" that's used on a letter with a "a," which is, in a good way, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of creating and developing those words.
So, right, let's do it.
But this word is obsolete, and it's no longer used in its proper meaning.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative effect on you from above, use the word "press."
You can also use the "pressure-based" design, but remember, it's a cleric.

What's the reason?"
"My attempt was going well, but then there was one of the Mercedes racers.
He was preparing to try and still managed to skip me, but it seems I've lost some time on it.
However, it's hardly a big impact on the result."
"In Sochi it's very difficult to overtake, starting a race will be the key?"
"Please, yes, but you never know how it's going to work.
It won't be easy anyway, because our car is much slower than the Mercedes cars."

Russian bailiffs demanded debt from a dead old woman
In Kurgan, bailiffs demanded that a long-dead woman pay a government fee of 200 roubles.
This is reported by the Ural Meridian.
In mid-September, the relatives of the late Maria Mitrofanovna Blinde received a letter from the Kurgana Division of the Courts, in which it was reported that a 105-year-old woman had been the subject of execution proceedings.

The bailiffs have promised to take care of the situation.
Users of social networks, after learning about the incident, advised relatives to file counter-claims against the old woman's pension and social benefits for the "lived" years after her death.
In 2016, the Court found a living man who had been reported dead.

The student maintained the highest level of military readiness of the Serbian army
The President of Serbia, Alexander Vuccic, ordered that the highest level of readiness to which the armed forces of the country were assigned be maintained due to the situation in the north of the autonomous province of Kosovar and Metochia.
"The President ordered that the highest level of alert be maintained and that a separate order be issued to cancel it," said the Serbian Defence Minister Alexander Woolin on Sunday, quoted by the TASS.

In Germany, 14,000 people took a demonstration against racism
Some 14,000 people took part in a demonstration against racism in the German city of Hamburg.
More than 450 organizations were supported by the campaign under the motto “Complete against racism”.
Originally, the organisers reported that some 30,000 demonstrators would take part in the campaign, who would encourage the authorities to refuse to deport immigrants from the country and defend people's right to protection and asylum, as reported by the newspaper Zeit.
The event also stated that the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean should cease to be an offence.
In addition, the demonstrators demanded the dismissal of the head of the Ministry of the Interior of the Federal Republic of Germany, Horst Zeehofer, and the dissolution of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
One of the participants in the Neuroz Duman campaign stated that the purpose of the demonstration was to show social cohesion and solidarity in the matter.
The refugees and immigrants should not be treated as others, and migration itself should be the mother of that society.
Numerous migration communities and anti-racism organizations had sent an open letter to the Minister demanding his retirement.
Through an operation in Syria, Russia protected itself from terror
In the course of three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of whom 85,000 have destroyed the Russian air and space forces.
This was reported on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the WBC, Victor Bondarev, Head of the Defence and Security Council of the Federation.
He noted the high precision in the use of air-to-air weapons: the air-to-space forces have and continue to strike precisely at the targets of the terrorist.
According to Bondarev, in three years tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria, such as ammunition warehouses, fortifications and offices.
By means of Russian air strikes, the defence of the jihadists was hacked -- a decisive contribution to Syria's government forces' advancement, handing over Interfax.
However, according to Bondarev, our military operation in Syria has protected Russia itself from terror, many of which had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, prohibited in Russia) and the Jebhat al-Nusru (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, about 4,000 Russians and some 5,000 citizens of the post-Soviet countries have fought on the IG side, and they have handed over TASS.
And it's only about registered persons, not counting those who have not been identified, that have underlined Bondarev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our country freely.
So, Bondarev remarked, in Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism at a far distance; otherwise, it would have been "to us."
The telephones of Boris Johnson and a number of British Ministers have been made public.
The personal data of a number of former and present British Ministers have been made publicly available due to the security failure of an application created by the Conservative Party, which is reporting Sky News.
In particular, the mobile phone numbers of the Minister of Finance, Philip Hammond, and the ex-heads of British MIDA Boris Johnston were available.
According to TV, several politicians received "unpleasing calls."
The technical problem has been solved, and the use of the application is now safe.
We are examining the reasons for the failure and apologize for any problems caused," said the Conservative Party.
During the crash, users could not only see confidential data, but also edit information in the profile of politicians and journalists.
Thus, in the profile of the Minister of Environment, Environment and Agriculture, Michael Gove, his photograph was replaced by a picture of the mediamagnate Rupert Murdoch.
Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, accused the US and its partners of war crimes in Syria and of supporting terrorism.
The [Western] Coalition completely destroyed the Syrian town of Raqqa, destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it was targeted, and committed mass murders of civilians, including children and women.
These murders under international law are war crimes," he said.
According to Muallem, the US and its partners have provided “direct support to the terrorists” because the targets of the rebels and the western coalition in Syria coincided and meant “the sowing of chaos, death and destruction on their way”.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also pointed out that the fight against terrorists in Syria was almost over and that the country had become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intended to rid Syria of its illegal foreign presence and that priority in rebuilding the country would be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Centre for the Settlement of Hostilities in the Republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, stated that two American F-15 aircraft had attacked the Syrian province of Deir al-Zor with prohibited phosphorus weapons.
The US rejected all charges.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, believes that, while respecting the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
This was announced by the Head of State during his visit to Kharkov oblast, commenting on the issue by Hungary of its passports in Zacarpatia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine," stressed Poroshenko.
According to Poroshenko, as President, he would defend Ukrainian citizens wherever they were, in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a passport scandal against Hungary, which consisted of the intention to ban the  Consul of that country from the coast.
"I fully share every letter that the MFA says," remarked the President.
As reported by FACT, on 19 September a video was published on the web showing the time Ukrainian citizens issued Hungarian passports at the Hungarian Consulate in Bergovo.
In doing so, they swore their allegiance to Hungary aloud.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, said that the Hungarian Consul, who appeared on a video with Hungarian passports distributed to Ukrainians, was required to leave Ukraine either by a decision of Budapest itself or would be removed by Kiev.
It was also reported that the prosecutor ' s office in the district of Zacarpata had initiated criminal proceedings for issuing Hungarian passports.
The incident is classified as “State adultery”.
Poetin flew secretly to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Poetin has spent the past two days in Dushanbe, where he participated in the work of the Council of States of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and has held a number of bilateral meetings with the Presidents of neighbouring countries.
Data on the flight of Russian flight No. 1 on the Flightradar site indicate that about 6 p.m. in Tajik time on 28 September Il-96-300 flew from Dushanbe airport and took a course to the northeast.
In the area of Lake Balkhas, the transponder of the plane was turned off.
The direction of his flight suggests that the ship could fly to Haqasia.
According to Baykal24, the president in Abakana on the night of September 29th met personally the head of the region, Victor Siemin.
According to informal information, Poetin flew to the Republic for a weekend, but the site's sources believe that the real reason is "the problem of the second round."

Valentin Konovov (CPRF) and the current head of the Republic, Victor Zimin ("One Russia").
However, on 21 September Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
Andrey Filjagin ("Just Russia") is expected to take part in the upcoming round.
The Haqsa media suggest that Poetin can accept the renunciation of the head of Haqsa and appoint a new president of the Republic, as well as a decision on the fate of Zimin.
Poetin had already visited Haqasia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the President's favorite places to rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict which has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people have fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
In the view of Damascus, military action is now nearing completion and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
This was stated by the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Muallem, in his address to the United Nations: "The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure because of the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terror, bringing them back to normal.
All conditions had been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country which they had had to withdraw because of terrorism and the unilateral economic sanctions which had made life and their means of living difficult.
The Syrian authorities had also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to provide funds to that effect.
Meanwhile, the US and the European Union have refused to provide assistance to Syria, arguing that a political solution to the conflict must be found first.
The Folxvagen fully pleaded guilty to the "deselgate" in January 2017.
Last December, he was sentenced to seven years in prison by Oliver Schmidt, one of the directors of an American division of the company.
The contract losses are estimated at at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.
Until June next year, the car manufacturer is obliged to buy or fix 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company's management announced that 83% of the cars had already been met, so that the program would be completed early.
FolxWagen is always trying to compensate for the loss and restore the client's trust.
Thus, the management of the firm has recently changed and there has been an announcement of a major reconfiguration and policy change in the management system.
Moreover, the Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesel on their streets: this power was acquired in February this year.

Mitropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the PCP with the actions of the Fascists
The head of the Synod Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Mitropolitan Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of Nazis against the Jews.
"It's the same as in Nazi Germany to put a yellow end star on a Jew, which means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and that's what this bill was for," said the mythropolitan broadcaster Russia 24 (the Interfax quote).
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at an acute stage.
Kyiv thus hopes to have complete control over the OCC and to “make it illegal” the clergyman considers it.
"It's a Ukrainian church, and the faithful of this church think they're Ukrainian, they're patriots of their country," he added.
It had previously been reported that members of the Verkhovna Rada were working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter suggests the renaming of the Moscow Patriarchate's PCP.
The deputy of the Pochayev laurel called for the protection of the orthodox and Ukrainian shrines
Vladimir, vice-chairman of St.-Uspen's Pochayov laurel, made a call for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) was published on Saturday on the website.
In various times of history, Christians who had gone before and after in faith and spirit had to practice their faith and defend their holy places.
Given the situation and the information we have and the threats of violence that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to survive,” said the Mitropolitan police.
He asked for support -- prayerful, moral.
Also, the viceroy of the laurel stressed that it is likely that "you will need your physical presence."
The clergyman added: "Lenin's grandsons, by spirit, threaten with execution, and therefore protect our holy place."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochayev laurel, the orthodox Ukrainian and world-wide shrine, needs to be prepared to defend it, as stated in the appeal.
The Mitropolitan has called on those who mislead the faithful not to go about it.
The PCP has a canonical status defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to make it dependent on the news patriarch and the Catholic Pope's friend Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is not acceptable to us.
And we're pleased with the status that our church has," remarked the viceroy.
He recalled that since October 1990 the CPI had been canonically independent and fully independent in its administration.
There is no administrative and financial responsibility for Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
Which other Tomos do we need?" remarked the Mitropolitan Pochayev Vladimir, urging the faithful and all citizens to ask whether other Tomos have any faiths, are they independent of the Vatican?
The faithful sorted out and decided to what kind of temple they would go to.
However, some want to sow enmity and strife again.
Some are envious that the dome is shining on the temples they want to destroy," stressed the clergyman.
The Latvian laurel is the largest church complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurels are located on the top of the Potato Mountain, 70 miles from Ternopol.
The first historical history of this is from the beginning of the 13th century.

Another sad post of the Instagram Bouzoa angered the subscribers
A singer and TV announcer, Olga Bouzova, cannot survive the betrayal of a member of the show "Married to Bozov" by Evgeny Nazarov, who chose her money and left the project.
The civil lioness published another sad post at Instagram, making her followers angry.
"I never thought that feelings could have a price.
Life is still teaching me... and when I start to learn about people," wrote Busova.
Many fans have reacted negatively to this post and have observed that, in fact, the singer "has never seen a real life."
"You're the one who hasn't suffered yet.
Stick to every word, live in a normal, normal family," wrote @nataliamama37.
There were some who suggested that Buzova contact a therapist or at least read books on the subject.
"Perhaps you should read literature on psychology?
What do you have to do to avoid being a victim?" @liashukgalina.
However, there were some who supported the singer.
"Oléa, don't be upset.
Your man won't speak loud words all over the country and then just don't do them," supported the Busov @arina_prostyle.
"You're the Queen and you need a King, and the one who traded you for paper just doesn't deserve you.
Raise your nose and go on," wrote @kerzentia_f.
Nazarov had previously explained his decision to take 2 million rubles and to abandon the bassian because the singer had no sympathy for him.
He decided to send all the money to charity.
If we keep playing the same thing right, the victories will come
The main coach of the Moscow Dinamo, Vladimir Vorobiev, was about the defeat of the Automobilist (0:1) at the regular CLC championship.
"The good game was, interesting though it was going to the goal," quotes Sparrow's official website, "The Automobilist."
"We were trying to play very easily.
I liked the first period very much.
We didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, we got a little shaken, we survived.
But removing us was a bit "feeded."
The guys played great, they did the coaching.
I think if we keep playing the right game, we'll win.
They didn't score, but the game's content was right.
Good luck will come if we keep playing in this direction."
"In your opinion, did the Automobilist add more than the meeting in Lower Novgorod?"
"Then the foreigner did not play.
At the pre-season, the teams were doing other things, playing a lot of young guys.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey game.
Automobile is a good team.
It's clear from the tournament table that the team is playing right.
A good ice-hockey, a good atmosphere both in the Arena and in the city.
You can only wish them good luck.
The command is moving in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defence, good gatekeeper.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
They knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but it didn't work."
Every inhabitant of Kalmakia is in debt
Citizens of the Republic are increasingly visiting the official Internet site of the Russian Federal Courts Service.
In the past eight months, more than 140,000 visits to the site have been registered, and more than 42,000 to the "Executive Process Data Bank" section have been downloaded.
According to the President of the Public Council of the UFSSP of Russia for the RC Valeria Bohdanov, almost every resident of the region is liable for public payments, GIELD fines, bank credits, and loan payments, and no one is safe from unexpected situations.
But debt may have negative consequences, such as a ban on going abroad.

The Chief Macedonian Opposition refused to vote in a referendum
In Macedonia, a referendum is being held on Sunday, 30 September, on an intergovernmental agreement with Greece to rename the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question, "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
However, the leader of the leading opposition party, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, the Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (WMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mitzko stated that he would not vote in a referendum.
As explained by the party's spokesperson, Naum Stoilkovsky decided to refrain from voting in order to express his opposition to a contract which he considered to be “bad.”
According to the Spokesman, the current referendum resolves the issue of renaming the country, and nothing more, while the party's strategic goal is to gain membership in both the North and the European Union.
A week ago, the President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen a name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considered the renaming of the country to be a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign State is being created with a new name," remarked Ivanov.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic, the Republic of Northern Macedonia, was signed by the Macedonian and Greek Ministers on 17 June this year during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, on which the border between the two countries passes.
This agreement should resolve a long-standing dispute about the name of the country, as well as Skopje's journey to both the North Atlantic and the European Union, like the TASS.

U.S. is managing an increase in the production of chemicals in Afghanistan
There was much talk in Tehran on 26 September about the sharpening of the situation in Afghanistan.
There was a multi-party consultation with Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Security Council's secretary, Nikolai Patrouchev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, the combatants unleashed a real terrorist war against the State authorities and the peaceful population of the country.
This year has become a record in the number of bloody attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” said Patrouchev.
Afghanistan's troubles did not start yesterday.
Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Al-Qa'idah terrorist group (prohibited in the Russian Federation) was declared to be the main enemy of the United States.
Not a month later, America and the North Atlantic allies launched a military operation called Enduring Freedom there.
It's been 17 years.
The thousands of United States troops are now on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more ghostous than it was then.
The American troops have been banished by dozens of their bases.
As they can, they're paid off for money, so they don't get hurt.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40%, according to Patrouchev.
50% in the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
10 per cent more for ISIL (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they grow up there fast.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-khaliphate in Central Asia, exactly what they have failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine with that.
And what's nice is that in 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40fold.
The huge growth of the area planted by the poppy and the multi-billion-dollar returns.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum to join the EU and the North Atlantic Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, subject to a change in the name of the country.
An agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long talks with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia, seeing in that name an attempt on the same name Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkowski, political scholar: "Thanks to this agreement Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope of social change.
And Greece will assert the right to its past.
There's no perfect agreement.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone at all happy."
The country is renamed by the ruling social democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zayev.
Contrast is the conservative opposition and President George Ivanov.
According to the journalist Clálin Chilimanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU -- it is enough to have a partner with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the present socialist government, led by Zayev, is forced from outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
Above all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the greatest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice made by Macedonian citizens will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole."
