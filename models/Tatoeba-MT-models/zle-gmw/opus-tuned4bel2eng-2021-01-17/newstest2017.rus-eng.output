28-year-old cook found dead in the San Francisco Mall.
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell in a local shopping center this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he can't imagine anyone who wants to hurt him, saying, "He's finally getting along."
The body found in Westfield Moll on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, as reported by the San Francisco Forensic Bureau.
The San Francisco police department reports that death has been classified as murder and the investigation continues.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told KGO's ABC television company in San Francisco that Frank, the former cook of the distribution line in Boston, had received his dream job as a cook at the San Francisco's Suns & Daugters restaurant six months ago.
The Spokesman of the Soss & Daughters said that they were "shocked and suppressed" by his death.
"We are a small team that works as a friendly family and will be very missed," said the representative.
Our thoughts and sympathy to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had been staying at the hostels at first, but recently, "He's finally getting along."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Luis Galicia said to KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
He had a good soul and a great heart.
His way of communicating with the family has always been to cook us some dish, to cook us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any fight.
He was a brother who sailed along the stream.
"In all the bad things that are happening to this world, he was the unadulterated diamond that shined brightly every day," he said.
Anyone in possession of information is requested to call the SFPD Hot Line at number 415-575-4444.
Churkin said that the United Nations meeting on Crime was useful.
The permanent representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, said that the last meeting of the UN Security Council on the Crimea had been useful, handing over Interfax.
"I suppose the discussion was useful to us, and we gave them information about what happened," said Churkin.
He explained that he had provided Member States with information on incidents in the territory of the Republic of Crimea in closed consultations and had read out a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, which “expressed concern and outrage at the attempted terrorist attack and sabotage in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.

Italy's public debt grew to record
Italy's public debt in June 2016 exceeded 2.248 Billions Euro.
The central bank of the country has declared that this amount is the historical maximum, and has provided the RIA News.
A previous negative record was set in May of this year.
The government debt amounted to 2,228 million euros.
It is observed that Italy's debt burden has increased by Euro77.2 billion in the first half of the year.
At the end of 2015, it had been reported that Italy's public debt stood at 132.7 per cent of the country's GDP.
Meanwhile, the Italian Minister of Economics and Finance, Pierre Carlo Padoan, projected a decline to 130.9 per cent in 2016 and 123.4 per cent of GDP in 2018.

Scientists found an animal that could live 500 years
An international group of biologists concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, transfers RT.
Scientists performed a radio carbon analysis of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five meters long, can be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in the longevity of a shark, leading to slow development.
Females of Greenlandic sharks reach puberty only by the age of 150.
It was previously believed that the longest vertebrate animal lived a "neighbourly" shark, a Greenland whale.
The oldest person known as a scientist was just over the age of 210.
Poetin changed the composition of the Russian Federation.
Russian President Vladimir Poetin by decree changed the composition of the Russian Security Council and reported to the Kremlin Press Service.
It had previously been reported that Poetin had removed President Sergei Ivanov's head of administration and had been succeeded by Anton Wyno.
Ivanov will now be a special representative of the President on environmental, environmental and transport issues.
Of the permanent members, the Russian Federation had excluded the member of the Board, Rashid Nurgaliev.
The council includes Sergei Ivanov, Anton Wyno, half the President of the FOO Sergei Majilo, and half the President of the FOO Nikolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov was dismissed from office as head of the President's Administration.
By decree of President Sergei Ivanov, he was dismissed from office as head of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov has been appointed special representative of the Russian Federation for environmental, environmental and transport activities.
Anton Wyno was appointed as the new head of the administration, formerly deputy Sergei Ivanov.
According to Vladimir Poetin, Ivanov himself requested that he be transferred to another job.
Should you go to the sanatorium if you have health problems?
Our expert is the principal doctor at the Olga Bogosh Sanatoria.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanatorium resorts are needed not only for the treatment but also for the prevention of diseases.
Under sanatorium conditions, a person can check his or her body and get advice from a doctor on how to live so that his or her health is not compromised.
No one would need such advice.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal to the body, and it's not to be discarded.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.
And the stress is around 90% of the people who come in.
It is particularly affected by people from large cities between 45 and 55 years of age.
So it's best not to complicate the situation and to let yourself rest on time.
Research shows that 98 percent of people have reduced their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the entire family.
So if you want to spend your vacation with your kids, you won't have to leave them.
For children, even the youngest, there are health programs that include both diagnostic services, paediatric counseling, testing and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, Oxygen cocktails, and physical exercise.
The doctor determines the course of procedure according to the individual evidence and characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, sanatoriums usually have children's clubs with animators, where children can attend games and various classrooms.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide the necessary conditions for their babies, and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
The soft winter, a long summer, the abundance of sundays in the year (over 300) creates good conditions for a year-round vacation at the Caucasus Minerial Water resorts.
And then the body doesn't just need to rest in the summer.
So you shouldn't be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most of the procedure is done indoors and is not dependent on the season.
In general, sanatorium treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for mature people.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Water region is, of course, therapeutic mineral sources: Slavansky, Smyrnovski, Estentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect the various systems of the body.
Water differs by temperature, amount of salt, total mineralisation, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks up water depending on the patient's health.
Thus, Narzan has an anti-inflammatory, immuno-enhancing effect, restores gastrointestinal tract functions and the exchange of substances.
Essentuki-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract, decreases the sugar level.
"Escentuki is a new one" has an anti-inflaming, galling and moisturizing effect.
The same effects have been experienced by Slavic water.
The doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system when assigning water.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salted water because salts hold the fluid, resulting in an increase in pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires moderation: water should be used at a certain time, at the right amount and at a certain temperature.
The sanatoriums now offer various cosmetic procedures for the face and body.
What types of healing, based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus, are available in the resorts of the region?
Near Pigorsk, for example, there is the salty lake of Tambukan, where the mud of which is useful for joints, spine, and internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immuno-enhancing effect.
It's a healthy walk along customized routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislowodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
It is popular in Kislowodsk, which is in close proximity to the Narzan mineral source.
There you can also take baths of wine, pearls, yovalent, selenium, salve-lacry, depending on what you get a doctor to do.
Let's extend the fruitage.
What can you do to make the crop run till the end of the season?
As told by Julia Belopukhov, an agrin and a daughter-in-law.
It's time for the tall tomatoes to do a haircut: remove their new steps, cut their macs, remove all the leaves to the penultimate brush with fruit and blossom with small blossoms -- they won't be able to grow.
All tomatoes, regardless of the constitution, as well as peppers and aubergines, are fed with sun-superphosphate extracting, treated with biomedicines (People - to accelerate the flow and growth of fruit, Phytosporin-M, Phytoslavin, Gamair, Bactophitee - against diseases, Immunocytophyte - to increase immunity, Biooxybazillin, Lepidocide, Phytoverm - if there are pests).
The only chemical means used at the end of the summer are copper comatose, colloide sulfur and green soap.
We're making the last flood of plants.
The long-banded cucumbers in the fireplace are dropped from the wallpaper so that the lower, barbed part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, pours warm water and Circon solution, puts a 5 to 7 cm compost stem.
It is also easy to extend the fruitage of a courgette by cutting off the old leaves, pouring warm water and a solution to complex fertilisers, and plant the soil under the bush.
To protect you from the cold of the night, set over a row of arcs with concealed material.
Keep the plants open during the day, and close after sunset.
Marks of the end.
What suggests that Russia emerges from the crisis?
The economists saw signs of Russia's exit from the longest recession in 20 years.
According to Bloomberg analysts, the GDP of the Russian Federation is showing positive performance, with GDP falling by 0.8 per cent in annual terms in the second quarter.
This indicator has been minimal since early 2015.
According to recent data from Rosstat, the Russian economy slowed down to 0.6 percent in the second quarter.
Central Bank and Mino-Eco-development have also recently reported on the stabilization of the situation.
The front is slow growth.
According to CBD experts, the Russian economy's recesses are over.
"The index estimate of Russian GDP suggests that the recession is over and the economy is still slow," says the Russian Bank's Newsletter, "What Trends Say."
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter has risen to 0.4 per cent, while the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter the Russian Federation's GDP stagnated in the second quarter, at 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasoned GDP fell by 0.2% by the previous quarter.
But during the quarter the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the GDP change was between 0 and 0.15,” quotes the IER representative of the RIA "News".
The slowing down of the Russian economy over the past five quarters suggests that the bottom has been passed.
Among other markers indicating signs of national economic recovery, Bloomberg refers to the growing demand for electricity and rail transport, and to the recovery of business.
If you make an adjustment to the fact that the year is high, it is clear that a factor of 1% of the electricity consumption can be partly caused by the extra working day.
Add to this the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of the goods transport, but it's hard to get exact data here, and the plus-minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by the season,” explains Cyril Jacobenko of ALORE BROCKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of a stable Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressures.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, Rossstat has recorded deflation for the past two weeks.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the evolution of the course of the ruble, which, although it showed great variations at the beginning of the year, the results of August have increased by 12% since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery that indicators from the real sector of the economy should follow,” Yakovenko stresses.
In addition, there has been an increase in industrial production in the Russian Federation since April.
In June, the rate rose by 1.7 per cent.
The decline in foreign trade has slowed from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The situation in the labour market, where the rate of unemployment has fallen to 5.4 per cent, also illustrates positive developments.
It was only in September 2015 (52 percent).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the question of the real income of the population is left to be desired.
The annual decrease is 4.8 per cent.
This may hinder economic recovery, as household spending makes a significant contribution to GDP.
Generally, their share in the structure of the economy is over 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the hard policy of the Bank of Russia is also a risk factor for economic growth.
The controller keeps the rate at 10.5 percent, which is not the best effect on the real sector.
A negative factor is the low level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial capacities.
But generally, one can assume that by the end of the year the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5 percent, compared to -3.7 percent in 2015,” Irina Rogova, an analyst of the GC Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of sportsmen recently launched in Russian soccer and well-lived in winter sports at the Sochi Games has not yet been so active in summer sports.
While Russians are the former aliens at the Rio Games, most of them are from former Soviet republics.
However, in Rio we can see the reverse, with a considerable number of Russians flying the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality is different.
Someone was taken to another country when they were kids without a choice.
Someone couldn't stand the competition for a seat in the Russian team.
And someone thought that abroad would create better conditions for development in sport.
AIF.ru has found at least 16 sportsmen who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But she was, of course, Elizabeth before.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to migrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
That's where she decided to follow the footsteps of her older sister--to pursue a light athletic.
Like the sister, Lisa chose to jump with the sixth.
If she were to stay in Russia, she wouldn't have been able to "turn off the throne" by Helen Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Games, Lisa will be the only one of our countrymen, though former, in the 6th jumping sector.
Its best achievements in this sport are the 2010 European championship armor and the silver of the mainland in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Helena Isinbayeva.
She was born in Novokuznski in 1986.
Her parents are religious preachers of the gospel.
Much because of their faith they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Helena, there were eight children growing up in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to get excited about fighting in high school.
As a result, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued to study at the U.S. Learning Center under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Isobinokov.
At the 2012 London Games, Helena lost her first fight.
But at the World Cup that same year, it's a win.
Before that, by the way, she had won silver at the 2010 world premiere.
It was followed by a 2013 and a 2014 silver.
Mary, 26, was born in Yaroslavla, where she first met the synchronous voyage.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to migrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Mary continued her studies.
She soon joined the U.S. team and showed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America it is the ceiling.
A new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Christina Shaldibin at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue to train the girl in the arts outside the ocean.
So far, the girl has been engaged in a favorite sport in her native Yaroslavla.
After emigring to the United States, she quickly joined the country's youth team and later entered the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
She did not, of course, have to fight for the first position on the world stage, but for the US, she set up a real breakthrough -- a star-saturated team at the Rio Games.
Another of our former artists is Ian Berezko-Margrander, who supports the German team.
She was born in Toliati.
In 2008, when she was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had a better chance of joining the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 London Games.
There, indeed, Ian was only able to occupy 17th place, not enough to get into the final competition in her personal title.
But two years earlier, she was able to win a bronze-medaille at the Games -- young.
Another gymnast, only this time is Irina Sazonov.
If the way in which the above-mentioned sportsmen are to migrate can be described as standard, the choice of Irina's family is very unusual in Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd sports school.
Of course, in Iceland she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, Ira is training in Russia, especially when he comes to his home country to keep his skills alive.
In Rio, she did not speak as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal multi-fight.
There is very little information about the swimmer Mary Koulkoy in Russian information space.
For a very long time Mary has lived and trained in Switzerland.
However, for a long time it had been flying under the Russian flag, showing good results -- it had even a record of 200 meters of butterfly.
In 2015, she became a Swiss national and began flying a red-and-white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in the 4x100 complex relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project that was able to raise about 6,000 Francs, which enabled her to pay for the preparations for the Games.
A 31-year-old freestyle fighter, Adam Batirov, spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, Hasaurt's native became the three-time champion of European championships, Russia's champion, and Russian master of international sports.
When he stopped joining our national team, it was time to think about a change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter has disappeared from sports posts.
A triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian championship -- Batirov had already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold coin and won a trip to the Rio Games.
There's another Russian, Michael Kudinov, who knows even less about Switzerland's swimmer Mary Ugholkov.
The fact is, his parents migrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Mikhail began his gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, the best result was the 40th place in parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Games in gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family migrated to Israel.
There the girl continued her training in synchronized swimming, showing high performance at the national level.
In the 2014 European championship in Berlin, the girl took the sixth place in the synchronous voyage.
In a duo with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia won number eight.
She was the fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dimitri Croiter is in favour of Israel's team.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dimitri became the champion of the country.
He won the World Cup in the same year.
A year later, Croyter won the gold of the Singapore Young Games.
Besides high jumping, Dmitri jumps in length and triple jumps.
31-year-old Albert is another resident of Hasaurth, who, after a long campaign for Russia, has decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In the Russian Federation, he was a champion of the Krasnoyarski High School of Sport, and he became a champion of the country in 2011.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow as a member of the USSR Volleyball team, Yaroslav Antonov.
Just one year before the birth of Yaroslav's son, he was recognized as the best player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
That's where the family remained.
In 2015, he became a national champion of the European championship held in his new home country.
Hadjiev was born in March 1994. He was born with his family in the middle of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to migrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to that northern country -- to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
He soon won the world's premiere among young people, and later qualified to take part in the Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the competition.
And again the free fight, and again the former Russian.
This time we're talking about the native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain -- Tymuraz Frieva.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is currently in favour of a team in that country.
Before that, it was true that a 30-year-old sportsman had been able to record high scores in Russia.
He became the country's 2007 and 2008 championship champion.
The statute of absence from the team, Timuraz, decided to change the state of sports.
The last one on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995, in the capital city of Daguestan Mahachcal, is Arthur Biarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur began to box on the advice of his older brother.
Arthur has since become a champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became a champion of the world among young people.
In 2015, Biarslav won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new home country since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do kids have cosmic classes in school?
According to governor V. Condratiyev, "the signs need to be raised in a system-wide manner, not by actions and parades."
They must grow up and understand from at least seven years of age that they are cossacks and education must be cossacks.
But so far, I think this job is being formalized and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes take over all the positives that they've built up before, at a qualitatively new level, I'd love to.
If everything's up and down, and it doesn't know how, the new idea will turn out to be cheap populism.
LCDs continue to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There is an intruder of society with resources allocated to the public sector from various levels of budget.
According to the Office of the Public Prosecutor, overpriced fares are one of the most common crimes in the area of LCH.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid over 170 million roubles.
Recently, the prosecutor's office in Krasnodar Province also found evidence of undue costs included in the fares.
And the cost of the GMO "IV Consulting" (cold water) was 4 million roubles for the rental of cars at a price higher than the market price.
And there's a lot of such examples around the country.
The people pay their last money for the "community" and pay it properly -- according to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: waste, legalization of the proceeds of crime, abuse of power, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the foundation who was working on the repair of the city, Makarov had entered into a contract with the businessmen, the work on them had not actually been carried out, but was paid for.
Businessmen just paid him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the CC, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spent it on their needs.
As a result, millions of rubles are damaged by the budget and the occupants.
Macarov's scheme is, unfortunately, typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions of the heads of the Criminal Code, who had embezzled citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan, by the way, is under way, as well as a former councillor, who is accused of 91.7 million roubles of fraud.
According to the investigation, it established six companies in the city of Elizovo Kamchatsk and created three companies with limited responsibilities.
One of them was engaged in contract work for the CC, and the other two were called payment centers, i.e. receiving money from the population.
However, A. Cohan's energy did not pay the money, but spent it on himself, the one he loved.
It's quite difficult to sue in the area of GKH.
Things don't start, they're slow.
And "helps" in this highly confusing apartment law, Svetlana Provertev, the NS Executive Director of the GHS Control.
We don't have time to make one law, as we come up with a new one that should make the previous one work.
There are also few professionals, including judges, on VCS.
It is recognized by lawyers themselves that very little attention is paid to residential law in higher education institutions.
The prosecutor's office has also talked about the failure to initiate criminal proceedings and the lack of investigation.
Of the 3.5 thousand crimes in trial in 2015, less than half had been committed.
The rest of the investigation took a long time and one in five was suspended due to the lack of identification of the accused.
Frequently, shortcomings in law enforcement have been attributed to gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the investigation authorities are slow to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting, with only 60 criminal cases brought.
In the five months of this year, the number has only slightly increased to 99.
And what is the falsification of the tenants' protocol?
This means that changes in the management of the house, financial and other matters tend to circumvent the views of the owners.
It also means that the public services market cannot be accessed by normal companies that want to work honestly, rather than by “divorce” the population.
So the tenants are negative, the small and medium-sized business, too.
Above all, by putting an end to corruption as such throughout the State, Anton Jarkov, a member of the State Property Committee, is sure.
This work is now under way.
It's not just isolated actions, it's a targeted course against corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, the capital doesn't smell scandals.
Why are there no such scandals in Moscow in the area of GKH as in many other regions?
Because the capital government has shown iron will and brought about order, Anatoly the Chosen One, a member of the State Security and Anti-Corrison Committee, told AIF.
I mean both human resources and legal changes and legal education.
Managing companies have been closely monitored and all have been licensing.
Citizens' complaints are quickly resolved in public space (and the addresses of the occupants, and responses are posted on the Moscow Government Portal).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but follow closely what it says about the house.
Public awareness of ownership rights and the responsibilities of resource and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is testing the validity of the rents on public utilities, as a large part of the budget is allocated to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
Maybe all this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
So it's all about the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the willless should change the place of work.
Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up his friendship with the EU and the US?
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey put forward an ultimatum, offering a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Guelen, an Islamic preacher accused of having organized a coup d'état.
He said so in front of his followers in Antarctica.
Erdogan called on Americans to abandon their support for the "Terrorist Fethullist Organization."
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the US is called upon to change its position.
The experts believe that the divisions in Turkey's relations with the West are growing and can lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"America will sooner or later make a choice between Turkey and FETO" (the Teroristic Fethullist Organization).
Either the organizer of the FETO coups or the democratic Turkey.
She has to make this choice," quotes the Anatoly agency's address by Erdogan on Wednesday evening in Antarctica.
The President of Turkey once again, but has already demanded more strongly that the US comply with his demands, which he made for the first time immediately after the repression of the mutiny.
On the night of 16 July, the Turkish army made an attempt to overthrow its legitimate power and an attempt on the life of the head of State.
However, after Regep Erdogan addressed the population, the mutiny was suppressed and its organisers and participants arrested.
A total of about 8,000 people were suspected of having teachers and researchers in their ranks, in addition to the military.
According to Regep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Guellen, who lives in Pennsylvania State in the United States.
Erdogan's followers also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the interdiction.
The United States denied all its claims by refusing to hand over Guillen and encouraging it to change its tone.
The State Department's last statement in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey from insisting on it and is also demanding other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to meet its responsibilities under a migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not set a date for the lifting of visa restrictions on Turkish citizens,” announced the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Chelik, on 9 August.
He said that the change of the anti-terror law by Antarctica, as required by the EU, would compromise Europe's own security.
Note that on August 1, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders to immigrants in order to ease the visa regime with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement made by the head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Another insidious statement by Chavushoglu took place in the past Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not rule out that the country would consider leaving the alliance unless it received the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence sphere is not a step against the North Atlantic.
There are countries of the North Atlantic that are cooperating with foreign States in the field of defence -- importing rockets," said Chavushoglu in an interview with Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system based on its technology and to work with other countries.
"Turkish has so far tried to work with the member countries of NATO, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others," said the Minister.
The experts believe that this is a sign of Turkey's serious differences with the West and the country's redirection to the East.
The head of the International Institute for Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is currently playing his game and cannot go to a severe confrontation with the West.
He has a lot to do with the West both in terms of business and military (Turkish is a member of the North Atlantic), so I think Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining a framework with the West.
Though, of course, it would be easier for Americans to see a completely obedient man on this post," the expert explained.
He said that after the Turkish leader's statements (on the non-compensation of EU compensation, the requirement for a visa-free space with Europe and the release of Guillermo from the United States) he might be pressured to do so.
"Regeep Erdogan will face a decline in relations both with America and the European Union, and they will pressure him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of government, etc." Minchenko says.
The head of the Centre for Political Information, Alexei Muhin, admits that the President of Turkey will change his mind as soon as he enjoys it.
Eight months ago Erdogan took a very hard stand against Russia and sought favor in every way in the West.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that after a while the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdogan has entered the shuttle diplomatic period.
Being between the two poles, the West and Russia, he'll try to maximize his profit,' Muhin thinks.
In his view, the main challenge for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, and to that end he needs Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Poetin to stop the US from supporting Guelene.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which through it controls the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached,” the expert considers.
Anna Glassov, head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, took a different view.
Turkey's relations with both the EU and the US are now tense enough, and this is particularly due to the domestic policies that Erdogan personally pursues.
I think that this crisis will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reboot politics both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, claim that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, settled relations with Israel, engaged actively with Iran,” explained AIF.ru Glassov, which suggests that Erdogan's next step will be to normalize relations with Egypt.
She said that the policy currently pursued by Erdogan was a return to the foreign policy concept followed by Turkey before the Arab revolution.
“It was then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in its zero-neighbourly positions.
There have now been very successful visits by the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and enhance Turkey's position on both the regional and the international fronts,” the expert considers.
The eye believes that Turkey's return to its former EU relationship will be incredibly difficult, and the question now is whether the EU will begin to respond severely to Turkey, which can open borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Strike by the assistant doctors: Calls for new collective protests
The assistant doctors requested the trade union to approve new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Medical Assistants' Committee (JDC) is about to ask its full council to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says the Ministers have not been able to answer the questions about the employment contract.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the contract with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the secret vote.
In a letter to members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC President Ellen McCord said that the government had continued to "strongly remain silent" about the problems she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, "Bearing in mind the current situation, the head of the JDC voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your matters."
In response to the government's silence, the head of the JDC today made a formal request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuous programme of expansion of collective protests starting early September.
The dispute led young doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the Public Health Service.
BMA's assistant doctor, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting for the termination of the agreed terms of employment, which BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to be accepted during meetings leading up to the voting of 54,000 young doctors and medical students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that this employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "The Allies of Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Poetin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the strong impression that Antarctica wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Poetin's smile seemed strained, and he hardly emitted warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, spoke repeatedly of his dear friend, Mr. Poetin, five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-Crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm suggested otherwise.
But the lingering cold coming from Mr. Poetin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first one he mentioned in the introductory remarks: Turkey had hit a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was violent.
Mr. Poetin broke out with an angry tirade, accusing Antarctica of beating Moscow in the back.
The insult was even greater on the basis of an alleged friend.
The restoration of real confidence will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
Over the months, government-controlled media have carried out a staggering, total attack on Antarctica.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be blamed for everything.
The most serious were the charges made by senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's own family had profited from the illegal trade in oil from Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it decisively.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Mr. Poetin had received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a sort of victory.
For Anker, the advantages of a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost thrown off his post last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him as well.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have struck hard, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring a few million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number dropped sharply by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tourist operators and charter companies here will certainly feel relieved when flight finally resumes.
They put at the top of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of farm products were allowed again.
"Tourists in there, tomatoes back here," as the report in the Vedosty newspaper said.
But the visit also had an added political value for Moscow.
Hankar is angry at the West for considering it a weak response to an attempted coup.
Add to this her prolonged dissatisfaction with the pace of conversations about joining the EU and Mr. Poetin's move to take advantage of the coolness and gradually break up Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won positive scores with Antarctica for calling for the support of elected authorities after an attempted coup d'état.
Bear in mind this is a gift for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit in this brilliant palace on the coast of the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as an "alice of bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West join forces.
However, despite the public demonstration of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
Perhaps speaks for itself that after nearly three hours of initial talks, while the two Presidents gave a press conference, they did not even address the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the question of their differences, while Mr. Poetin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and given the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a member of the North Atlantic Organization of the United States of America shot down a Russian jet fighter — it is better that the two leaders at least speak again.
The Royal Scotland Bank will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's Executive Director.
The Royal Scottish Bank will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Ross MacEvan told the BBC of Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank had retreated since it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategyks used "RBS" to protect other brands of consumer credit.
He was supported by millions of pounds of international sports support, from the six-nation Rugby Cup to the champion Wimbledon Andy Murray.
But now it's decided that it's right to let more national brands get to the top.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking, which will have a greater influence -- Cutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brend RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one that our staff will be engaged in, because we are now becoming more a brand bank."
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying that we no longer have global aspirations; we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something quite different in their own population groups, and our staff will work with clients under those brands.
RBS has already declared that it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation Cup, and it is building a profile of different brands in sports.
"This is the right time for us to move the brand bank, because the basis (we asked ourselves) is how we focus on improving the customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work that we've been doing, focusing on the needs of our clients rather than on our own, I think you've seen a lot of change.
We can get those brands back again, so I think it's a good time.
Francie Dettore reaches 3000 winners with a victory in New Market on The Device.
Dettori sprinkles the Champagne after a take in New Market leads him to 3000 wins.
Jockey Francie Detttori won his 3000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark by means of his second winner of the night on his home track--at the Device trained by John State.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who has reached this remarkable mark in smooth leaps.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doog Smith, Leicester Piggott, Pat Iddie and Willie Carson.
The three-time jockey champion of Dettory, who had previously won at the Guyar, said, "That's something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm really glad this happened in Newmarket, because that's where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big social event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's just a Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and very unattractive.
Detectors accept applause when it comes to predestination after victory
The two jockeys reached this point in the race with obstacles: the jockey champion Richard Johnsson and the retired 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4300 won a record career.
Leicester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Francie is one of the finest jockeys of the modern age, and it is not surprising that he has reached that score, which so few have ever reached.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical wit that distinguishes him from the others in the weight room.
He's a great racing agent, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Francie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he hadn't been just a jockey for the weekend and a big jump!
And seriously, Francie led the winners in Britain for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British jumps, but he's an incredible jockey.
Francie Detttory celebrated this remarkable mark with a branded rapid leap from his horse.
From the rapid finishes to the rapid spikes, Francie Detttori has been a symbol of the British smooth leap for two decades.
These were ups and downs.
Many of the winners of the big jumps, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996 but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified because of doping.
Three years ago he first encountered difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed a great force of will to challenge sceptics and get back into shape.
And he probably hasn't finished for a while yet -- Dettory said earlier that he would like to continue to take part in the competition at least until he is 50 years old.
Poetin fires the Chief of Administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Poetin unexpectedly dismissed his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Poetin's trusted neighborhood for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed as a representative for environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Poetin “has decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President,” but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy, Anton Wyno, has been appointed to succeed him since 2012.
Mr. Wyno, 44, former briefcase.
Born in 1972 in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassade.
He was later the head of the Office of the President's Office and the Government's Office, reporting the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
At the time of his appointment, he said to Poetin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your work as head of State in terms of drawing up draft laws and monitoring how your instructions are being implemented.
Poetin informed a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had requested his release and recommended that Wyno replace him.
Do smiles convince you?
It's a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Poetin's closest advocates and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, the KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Poetin, which was broadcast on State television, both men declared that the Chief of Administration had resigned on his own accord.
But despite the smiles on the camera, there's not much that's convinced here, especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the unintended consequence of some power struggle?
Nobody knows yet.
But the official statement -- that a man who was once agitated as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russian environmental policy -- was met with huge scepticism.
In a comment to Poetin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you to trust me with this very difficult position, even a problem post, for four years.
Well, it turns out I've been head of the president's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously worked as the Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Mr. Poetin.
In the late 1990s, when Poetin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Poetin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once felt that Ivanov could have been president of Russia after Poetin's second term, since the third term for Poetin would have contradicted the constitution.
However, this post was occupied by another close supporter of Poetin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Poetin became Prime Minister until his return to office only three and a half years later.
The star of "Think As a Criminal" by Thomas Gibson is fired after a fight with the producer.
Gibson was a part-time shooter at a show in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint application.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday, before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences on the shoot and differences of opinion.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how the character of Gibson will be erased from a show that follows a team of F.B.I. agents is expected to be received later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studies.
A 54-year-old actor who had previously played a leading role in Durma and Greg's sitcom had been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love thinking like a criminal" and I've put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," said Gibson in a statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but now it's impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team, and, most importantly, the best fans the show could ever dream of.
The show's supposed to come back with its 12th season on September 28th.
Puzzle: Fish landed in the garden of Banfa
A man from Banfa sought help in locating the fishes that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bane thinks that 75 fishes might have been sandstones left behind by a water torch.
Bane, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a picture of this spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of a two-inch fish.
The Bridge is now connected to Fife.
The 1.35 billion pounds project must now be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the north and the Queensferry Crossing video, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four links between the canvas veres, which are now approaching completion near all three pilons of the bridge.
The Fife Bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vants of bridge.
The £1.35 billion project now has to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economics, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing engineering art on a really epic scale in this project, where over 30,000 tons of concrete were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the link between the Viaduk and the bridge sheet is a virtual operation using extremely exact assembly permissions.
A total of about 79% of the entire bridge canvas is now in place, and for the last section of the painting, concrete is poured out in Rosteck today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to climb to the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first link on each bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this link is the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it to the growing roadworks of the Northern Pioneer, we were left to close the remaining gap on the north side — or the shoreside — of the road.
This was done by dragging the northerly approach Viaduk up to 700 millimeter south.
It was a massive and, at the same time, very elegant operation.
It's huge because it's 222 meters long, it weighs about 6,000 tons, and it's supposed to be raised to about 3% slope.
It's fine because the permissions the team was working on were tiny -- just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Salvation in the Bay of Moelfr: Three men's luck to stay alive
Three men's luck to stay alive after they were thrown off a fishing boat in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 1:20 p.m. British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in the Bay of Moelfr.
Three men tried hard to get to a safe place, while their ship continued to sail.
"We saw their ship circled next to them and assumed the worst," said the driver's rescue boat, Vince Jones.
"Happily, by the time we got down on the water, a strong wind had taken him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while a third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and gripped by a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all boarded by the shore rescue boat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water are lucky they're alive and completely intact.
The engine had an emergency fuses, but somehow it got off the man driving the boat when it rolled over.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, preferring to spend their free time watching screens, has been a complaint to many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people away from the couch and engages them in some physical activity.
The screen's time was originally limited to television, video games and recently smartphones.
It's so nice to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the complete fascination that Pokémon Go is, an app based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (following a series of cartoons, playing cards, etc.).
Like many other pop culture events, all of this became obsolete a little earlier than this new game became available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed at that time due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter did.
So how does it work?
In short, players with smartphones are searching for Pokemons that are tracked by GPS and, if found, can be photographed (through a screenshot on your phone) or caught.
The generation that played the game as a younger generation joined the obsession by breaking off the couches to look for it.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken daily by a "normal" person.
Cardiogram, an application for Apple Watch, which trackes 35,000 users, recently reported that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people tracked by them, who performed 30 minutes of exercise daily, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go; it just sees the primary levels.
Many health campaigns that persuade people to take 30 minutes, get off the couch, and be active every day have not found a response, because most health messages are boring and are spoken out by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high arterial pressure, Diabetes, and a long list of advantages, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it drags people out to do what they love.
Thus, there are three health foundations: movement, fresh air, and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends hunting.
As usual, there are boring nerds who are looking for something to complain about.
And, yeah, somebody might run into the door.
So what?
There's been a break.
Because even though smartphone applications like Fitbit might have been able to monitor our physical activity before, they did not give us a reason to study, as this game does.
The news is on the table, and the use will decrease over time.
However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Bayles wins the gold of absolute superiority in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the fuss.
Simone Bayles is invincible for all this.
Dynamic on the back jump.
Unenforced on a log.
stunning on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the champion of the olympics.
A 19-year-old American gymnastics went up to the title of absolute championship on Thursday, placing the gap between herself and the rest of the world on a persuasive demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her total score was 62.198 from the silver Medalist and teammate Eli Reisman and the Russian armoured Medalist Alia Mustafina.
Bayles, from the United States, performs the Gymnastic Trumpet during the final final of the women's individual absolute first performance in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bayles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the championship of absolute supremacy and fifth in general, asserting her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She cried when she showed her final score and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as the extremely rare athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who raised their sports to new heights:
Byles spent the last three years dominant in her sport, winning 15 World Cup Medals -- including 10 Golds -- with such staggering programs in their mix of hard work and precision that the 1984 champion Mary Lou Retton called it "the greatest gymnastics I've ever seen."
One last test was expected in Brazil, a competition not so much between Bayles and the others in this field as between her and the load of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's house in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold coins, would be seen as an unfulfilled expectation.
Simone Bayles from the United States, on the left, and Eli Reisman are hugged after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the finals of the women's individual absolute first arts gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Byles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the retiring Martha Karoli's national team's national team.
While Bayles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that's not quite true.
Part of her free exercise program, which includes her branded passage, is installed on Latin music, which would go right outside of the Rio Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a child and opened by the mother of coach Aimee Burman during her visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn't lost a single absolute championship match since the summer of 2013, a lucky strip that should last as long as Bayles wants.
Although Mustafina had a small advantage with two rotations, it was a mirage.
The hymn log and the free exercise, where Bayles defends the championship of the world, are ambushed.
She went forward again with 15.433 on the log and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
Reisman hugged her gently while they waited for the final score -- pure formality -- and the tears appeared around a shiny red and blue billet for the eyes of Bayles, when the idea which she had once recorded in the clipping album came true.
Reisman's speech was a little revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost Mustafina's armor on the Tay Break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of a team called "Grandmother" was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise covered by the return, which sometimes seemed in question.
As for Bayles, a 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
police: 3 victims in the serial killer case shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack in the first serial killer of Phoenix in the last decade were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Alice, and Alice's daughter, Malia, were shot dead on June 12 when their car was parked on the carriageway, and the authorities announced.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots with a pistol standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he escaped on another vehicle, and reported.
The police claim that the triple murder does not seem to be the result of the robbery, as the perpetrator did not take the wallet or the $2.900 that was in the possession of one of the adult victims.
A Phoenix police agent, sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting had prompted the investigators to check if he had been involved in the previous four attacks.
Only seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas within four months.
"It's happening in a residential neighborhood outside the house," said KPHO, the CBS branch, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several cars, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal the evidence which led them to conclude that the attacks were connected and were committed by the same killer.
Alice, aged 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Alice's daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual that they were sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shelling, which was targeted by an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-year murder and was believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The investigators found the casings and extracted the bullet from the seat and the fragments of the bullet from the engine room.
The mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephalus: "It's getting better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of her peers, Edmund had microcephalus as a result of a genetic disorder about which his mother, Elizabeth Pixivto, did not know during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not really true -- of course you're signing up for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized hospital.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that yet," Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with walkers.
Edmund wasn't sitting there and crawling till he was three, and he's still not talking.
But it's slowly going through some of the steps.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund made for "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language, she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalus can result from a range of different factors: genetic diseases such as those of Edmund, infection during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zeke.
Symptoms and predictions may vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those living with the Zeke virus.
Piksivto remembers emotional loss due to an uncertain future.
Did I keep telling you what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime forecast, because I don't expect anybody to really tell me.
But Pixivto has an encouraging advice for mothers of children with congenital impairments due to Zeke.
It's getting better.
You know, everything's going to be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
The heavy rain, the flood, is causing rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more precipitation expected to fall over the state by Saturday.
Numerous rivers in South-East Louisiana and South Mississippi have flowed off the coast and threatened to flood large-scale after extreme precipitation, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bell Edwards, said that government officials were in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, the governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests were being made for transport for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said it was only the parish of Tanjipahoa that asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The risk of flooding remains valid until Saturday in much of the south of Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an extra 3 to 5 inches might slide into the area.
In southern Alabama, waiting for the flood to take place until Friday, as the rain continued in the Mobil area.
The Comite River near Baton-Rose and the Amit River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are projected to have set a record for last weekend.
The synoptic Alec Crowtmann said that both rivers might have flooded many houses in the suburbs near Baton Ruz.
He also said that the flood going down the stream in the Assenchen parish was a threat, as these rising rivers would flow slowly into the lake of the Morpa.
The Ticfo River, just south of Mississippi's border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever registered level at 9 a.m. Friday morning.
Squads still pulled people out of the flooding in Amit and Wilkinson County in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among the rescued early on Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, aged 62, says that the Beaver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, have rapidly risen overnight.
He said that the other stepson, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept coming," said Hansford.
She's reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest tributary she had seen in 48 years that she had lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family had a disability, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Crowtmann says that the flood is spreading rapidly, as the rain continues, noting that officials are considering an escape order.
Crowtmann says that an observer outside Livingstone reported a rainfall of 13.75 inches from midnight till Friday morning.
Crowtmann said the soil was overfilled with rain from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets have led to the rescue of the inhabitants from their homes in the parish of Tangjipahoa and the dropping of classes in five school districts, according to the authorities.
WWL, a branch of CBS, reports that counsellor Tanjipahoa spoke of 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants have been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooding.
The president of the parish, Robert Miller, said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven animals in high water.
The shelter was opened in the city of Amit and in the city of Hammond to accept those who had been evacuated.
"They'll have an opportunity to come home as soon as the water starts to retreat," he said.
In the town of Hammond, about two dozen streets were closed because of high water levels and sandbags were available to the inhabitants in the hope that they would keep the water away from houses and factories.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said the city manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Services, Rupert Lacey, reported that the rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, manager of the Shopper Value Foods store in Amit, lives in this neighborhood for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," said Towson, "and it's still pouring on the ground."
Mahage Brown, six, "cut with bullets," survives the shooting in Philadelphia.
The police report that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering a second shot at a six-year-old in the city this week.
The grandpa and grandpa of the child recognised him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandma and grandpa say Brown got multiple shots, including his smell, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was moved to the hospital.
"He's had a hard time, his little body has been shattered with bullets," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez, at the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in hospital in critical condition and has survived several operations.
The family told the station he was expected to get better.
He was supposed to go to the first grade in the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Jermantown quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-olds is reported to be in critical condition; the other two were registered in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The baby was found shot in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting to the station.
The other two were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been shot.
Investigators report to Philadelphia's CBS that there appears to have been an exchange of fire between several armed men.
Semi-automatic casings, attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons, have taken effect.
It seems that it was certainly a long battle.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the pavement.
So apparently there were several armed soldiers and they were actively involved in the shooting,” reported police captain Anthony Ginauldy of Philadelphia.
Many of the houses and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests were made and the police were reported to be searching the CCTV cameras.
Another six-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the hand by a shanty bullet on Tuesday, when he played in front of his house in West Oak Lane.
She's resuming, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Lori
That's what I call this year's women's gymnastics team for several reasons.
First, I've been to every summer championship since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And the second is that three gymnastics play a key role in this team: Simona Bayles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, added by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
This also reinforced the black and Latin American women's presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, female gymnastics number one has been African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At the last Gabby Douglas Games, he was the unexpected champion of the world, and America was pleased.
The world could now witness the incredible three-time performances of the World Cup of Simone Bayles, Douglas and Lori Hernandez, performing unexpected but nonetheless virtual gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in a woman's individual absolute majority.
And Ali Reisman's team colleague made silver.
We're witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like that in gymnastic sections all over the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Lori all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form an olympics team.
They're the final five, because the next gymnastics team will have only four gymnastics in the team, and this is Martha Karoli's last year of coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics is a expensive sport, and gymnastics are first trained in private gymnastic clubs supported by parents who pay the cost of education, equipment, travel, uniform, competitive contributions, hotels (for coaches and their gymnasiums and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their exercises, and that's a expensive and long-term responsibility for gymnasium families.
Aimee Burman, coach Simone Bayles, and Maggie Hani, coach Lori Hernandez, both trained their female sportsmen from the moment they started gymnastics.
We must create more cost-effective and accessible gymnastic education for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastic foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (mainly Blacks and Latin Americans) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport.
Hymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to exhausting work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a life-long positive effect on health, school success and work.
It's the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that's wonderful.
Sport is so important, especially for girls.
Now is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Lori, Gabby, and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Power in winning team gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The younger doctors took up the announcement of further strikes after the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's offer.
The Ministers hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing to a modified agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce this contract, saying that NHS was on "none land" and any subsequent delay would damage the staff and patients.
The first young doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes night work and weekends to improve out-of-school services.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA Young Doctors' Committee, said last night in a statement, "The younger doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it feeds on the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors are transferred to a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The VMA's attempt to settle the dispute with the talks was met with a unwillingness to take action and sometimes with complete silence on the part of the Government.
And that despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of the younger doctors.
If he doesn't, then the younger doctors are sure that they're ready to organize a follow-up strike.
The last strike in late April delayed some 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nurse sessions, while nurses and counsellors were engaged to secure replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The Ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing to a modified agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
IMA wants to pay a better vacation fee for 54,000 young doctors who will fall within the scope of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employers, urged the assistant doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said, "The strike reaches little or nothing, but exerts pressure on already operating teams and services, and causes anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Medical Assistants' Committee and, together with the Health Department and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of custodians and corporate information policies.
It was hoped that the continued positive assistance on other important topics — such as staff distribution, flexibility of learning, extra education for those returning after career breaks, the cost of learning, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender differences in medical pay — was a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to meet the conditions reached by the WMA in November, February and May.
A 2-per-day drug can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use a 2-per-day drug after the authorities have recommended that it be given to more people for a longer time.
The anti-rotation ticgrilor reduces the risk of relapses for people with heart disease.
The drug is already scheduled for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new one.
The NICE Service of the National Health Service of the United Kingdom has recommended that it be given to people for four years in order to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE's National Public Health Service has now recommended that it be given to people for four years to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs every year in about 140,000 people in England, and a quarter of them have another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plasters.
If the plate is torn apart, it can cause a clot that prevents blood from reaching the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the blood stream and block the blood flow to the brain by causing a stroke.
People who have already experienced one attack are at greater risk of having another.
The Ticagoreau produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold as Brilique reduces the risk by making the clots less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 milligrams of ticgrilor for 12 months, then 60 milligrams of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Evaluation Centre, said, "Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention methods with about a quarter of the people who have already had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke occurs, often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative effect on the quality of life.
There is evidence that tic grelorine, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes from people who have already suffered a heart attack.
By pre-advising ticgrilor, we are happy to be able to increase the treatment available to the many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficiency and safety of ticgrilor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than that.
The PC ownership culture allows for the falsification of votes in the Islamic region
The Ex-Mary of Tower-Hamlets Lutfour Rachman was suspended last year because of corruption, triggering a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to blindfolding, resulting in widespread forgery of votes in the Islamic communities, based on information from a devastating government report published today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former cabinet member, is critiqued by police, election observers and city administrations for ignoring evidence of election abuses due to “excessive sensitivity to race and religion”.
The former secretary of the local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the religious harassment of voters was so strong that the police should be allowed to place borders outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
For the time being, voters should only specify their name and address.
The report even suggests that the ink should be applied to the fingers of people when they turn in their votes, so that someone can vote twice.
There must be better protection for informants, said Sir Eric.
It calls for greater press access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet voting scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the current mayor of Luftur Rachman should have been removed due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rachman had “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Islamic community and had silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rachman, as it was said, “began his campaign based on the fact that it was the responsibility of Muslims to vote for it”.
Up to 300 votes were doubtful or the result of a person voting, pretending to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He raised particular concerns about mail fraud, in which senior members of the Islamic community were reported to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the photograph, made several recommendations to clear the voting system, including the requirement to bring his ID to prove who you are.
His report states: "There was evidence of the pressure placed on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote at the will of older persons, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were fears that... public institutions had closed their eyes on such behaviour because of the oversensitive "politic correctness" of ethnicity and religion."
Sire Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including suspending political activists from working with the postal votes to stop the "harvest harvest".
The report under consideration by Theresa May also calls for enhanced registration checks to prevent the use of the voters' list for fraud with immigration and privileges.
The option of requiring voters to submit an identity card before voting is being considered.
Use ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their sheet to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year limit on applications for automatic mail voting.
Disable campaign politicians and activists from working with completed absenteeism and postal envelopes.
Give the police the power to set borders around polling stations.
Modify the law in order to make it easier for persons to be accused of being intimidated, as submitted by the People's Act of 1983.
Make photos illegal at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Increase education to ensure that the staff forces voters to go to the booth one at a time.
Sir Eric is violently attacking the city police, saying it's "astonishing," that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower-Hamlets trial.
"The election court disqualifies Lutfour Rachman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions," he reported.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt, the criminal standard of proof, on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the inconclusive "checking for the sake of a check" of the city's administrative offices.
Sir Eric said, "The previous court order in Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the disturbing and hidden spread of selective fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Cracked up by Kate's bicycle analogue and by other celebrities of the Rio Games
The fans of the 2016 Rio Games this week went crazy about the French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who turns out to be a very similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old player in the Games is not the only one who fights for gold this summer, who can boast of her own famous doppelganger, at least as reported on social media.
So, in honour of the Rio Games and all the famous people who appear on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of the olympics who have more than a surface resemblance to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: member of the U.S. male archer team Brady Allison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Besides Kate's double on the bike track, many people online hastily pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of Leonardo DiCaprio's superstar.
A member of the U.S. male archer team, Brady Allison, caused a hurricane on Twitter after images of it, which looked frighteningly like a Wall Street wolf star.
And actually, the archer found out about social media madness and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
"I don't personally see a huge resemblance, maybe except for the plant on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be even more marked this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Patterson and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliy Mustafin, with her large, distinct eyes, is said to be a true copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burge, Matthew Morrison was compared to the star of Glee Club for many years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user thinks that Nathan is the "sport version" of the actor "Start"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Raphael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
A silver medieval swimmer from Russia, Julius Efimov, can boast not only tanned leather and light hair like the actress Anna Lynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, according to fans, looks like "the sporting version of Joseph Gorgon Levitte."
Grey women: Hope Solo's soccer star, on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, have the same shapes of face and eye
Not the only one: one Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
By creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason why this pair is based on a similar appearance.
One Twitter user recently contacted the site to announce his admiration that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
Indeed, the star of United States football and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Lynnie, as well as the winning gold melody of Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful broad smile, which is like the smile of the star "Bless Success" by Gabrielle Union.
A commentator at the CBC Games apologizes for saying "dead like a pig" about a Chinese swim.
Byron McDonald's analysis of the fourth place at the end of the 14-year-old Ay Yanhan at the 4x200 m free-style women's estafette has resented CBC audiences in a live broadcast of the Games.
The Canadian CBC broadcaster was obliged to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started like a stench" and "dead as a pig" during the swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200 m free style.
You could hear McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC commentator team to "small it with color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a stench, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ay Janhan, who is 14 years old, sailed through the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79, a 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor cancer, by allowing Canadians to clear the gap from China.
Around Canada, audiences quickly reacted online after they were shocked by the tone and the expressions used.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC speaker just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig?"
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ay Yanhan from China in the final of the 4x200 m women's estafette, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
The Twitter criticism immediately struck Byron McDonald, and many urged him to be fired.
Twitter users did not resist when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "No way #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists.
Shortly afterward, Scott Russell, who broadcast CBC, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for having the comment on the swimming speech aired."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
SAF concluded by apologizing to over 90 people who tweeted in response
A friend of the commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald.
CBC then copied and sent their apology to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The network also hastily apologized and published the application.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to broadcast.
Last night we acted swiftly to apologize to our audiences live and to our subscribers on social media.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not about her as a person.
Yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron deeply regrets what he said.
On Thursday afternoon McDonald apologized live and tried to make his comment clear, saying that he did not think that his words would be interpreted as an attack on a person.
'I'd like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on the CBC Games.
'I was talking about a swimmer speaking, not about her personally.'
'It's obvious that there was no contempt and I'm sorry.'
A purchaser named Primark insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on her underwear in the middle of the store.
The customers didn't know where to look when some woman was naked to try on her panties, on the floor with the shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she tried on how she looked in them, pulled them together and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bowery Place store in Falkland.
Prymark Trade Center Superie Place in Faulxton, where a woman tried on her triculating panties before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of the two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that after testing the underwear of the mystery woman again "dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a pair of panties from the window, took off her own panties and panties and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a secret place to do it -- she just stood there, shameless."
"Everybody was staring when she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with the other three couples before she finally decided there was nothing here that she liked and dressed again and left.
"It doesn't seem like she cared who was watching her, or what she thought about the person who would eventually buy those underwear she was trying on."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson, from Kent, said, "It's a shame to think that someone's going to take home the underwear that someone else was wearing, and they haven't been washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these clothes from the market after she left -- and the better.
"I don't want to come home with a new pair of women's underwear and find out what another woman is wearing and taking them off, and they haven't been washed."
A representative of Primark said, "Primark knows what happened at our shop in Falkland on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the goods in question have been removed from the market.
How to protect yourself from attacks with a gun using a Krav-mage
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Misrachi, master of the Federation of Krav Magic in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether it comes from the front or the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If they come from behind, according to Misrachi, the first thing you need to do is to turn around so you can see the attacker and "free the line of fire."
Then you tighten the gun between your forearm and shoulder before you hit them in the face with a free elbow.
Then you follow the knee in the groin, and as the attacker bends away from the pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit him in the face with a gun, and back off, holding the gun pointed at him.
For an armed, forward-facing, it's like getting your body out of the line of fire, grab a gun quickly and twist it so that the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, move your weight onto a gun and hit the attacker with your fist in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grasp before you go back and aim at it.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video to see how Misrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery -- unless you're a master of Krav Maga -- is to give up your cash.
To guide the traveller, Ian Wright carries out his language in the most filthy places in Europe
The British traveller had put his immune system and his sick reflex to a serious test, licking some of the most filthy and disgusting places in Europe.
The host and author of the travel books, Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spent his language on the euro bill, the Circus Piccadili's railings, the flush button on the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is supposed to be a film called "The Guide of the Traveler-Lizoon on the Inner Power," has yielded some amazing results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of others may be extremely repugnant, but there are actually worse microbials in the kitchen sink.
Throughout Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and doctors about the increase in intestines and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing licked brought him any more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing his intestines by travelling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railing at train stations to the toilet flush button, this task has certainly experienced his immune system.
In the film he made, he said, 'I've been completely careless for my health since childhood and I've pulled a lot of things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample swab showed a luminometer of more than 4,000 units.
By comparison, just washed hands must be within 60 minutes.
But there was one Russian public toilet which he refused to lick after its luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while the newly washed hands show less than 60
Wright and the Finnish dairy product manufacturer Valio made a film about a traveler called the "Inside Power Guide" which shows the number of microbials in different places, for example in the toilet.
In the film he said, 'It's close to one of the worst things I've ever sniffed in the toilet.'
There's nothing more filthy than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
The "Finding-Lizuna Guide to the Inner Power" was taken together with the Finnish dairy-producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic microbio, and Vitamins C and D to help accelerate the growth of human intestines and develop the immune system.
First Vice President Valio for snacks, juices and new categories, Nico Woorenmaa said, 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be interesting to see and at the same time explain the value of the proriotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended up with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad microbials in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health, and how it relates to the immune system.
Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added, "Let's say I'd lose my respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were rather stiff.
I'm glad that some of these licks we managed to film.'
In a survey conducted in 2015, Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents associated acidic cells only with a good stomach and intestinal state, while 58 per cent said that they used at least occasionally products containing added acidic cells.
A family of bullies destroyed Saltash, the city house of Cornwall, on the evicted day
A family of bullies left their town house with a $50,000 loss after being evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were banished from their property in Saltas, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forced to evict from the real estate site, the shocking officials of the building and construction cooperative found the real estate site in a state that required repair.
The walls were left with shining holes, the floors were opened, the trash was spread over the floor and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and supposedly lives in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a landlord at Cornwall Houseing, said she was afraid he couldn't be saved.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are many things that need to be weighed, because this property is likely to be known as not a very good Cornwall aspect.
This family enjoys bad fame, and their name enjoys bad fame.
The couple had three sons, who had been living in a real estate facility from time to time, and the police reported that the kingdom of terror caused by the family had included bat-and-ball fighting in the street, terrorizing the inhabitants of the surrounding areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive shouting, quarrelling and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for anti-social behaviour in June.
In a few rooms of the house, which may be breakfast, found the old trash
Boards of floors in a house where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Houseing forced her and her partner to leave the house this week, after having been granted an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily leave.
The expulsion was a relief to the neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One said, 'They didn't bother anybody.'
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'That morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here -- we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the leader of Cornwall Houseing's neighborhood team, said that the family was unable to work with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and regularly called the police
The trash and old toys were scattered down the green side of the town house.
He added: 'It's a shame that the tenant couldn't take any responsibility for her and her family's behaviour, because evicting is always the last method that Cornwall Houseing considers.
It was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was limitable, and their actions must have been horrifying to its observing neighbours.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall communities have invested in, who have courageously acted to give us information.
I hope that this development will give a little comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that associative behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the evicted
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that surrounds the house
In 2014 the police searched the house and found more than 70 years of pottery and weight, supplies and 1,700 dollars in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he pleaded guilty to possessing Class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She stated that the money was to pay for the tomb for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After they were rendered homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were covered with graffiti all over the surface.
The police say they'll try to evict tenants who don't follow the lease rules.
Angela Crowe, of the Devon and Cornwall police, said that this expulsion sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
'It's a message to those who feel they can behave without being accused by the prosecutor, as well as by those who are harmed by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be accepted by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were frightened when a low-flying military plane almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists enjoying sunlight were frightened for their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that it was on a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk
This is the moment when frightened tourists start to panic, while a low-flying plane sprang over a crowded beach.
There are dramatic images of a military plane flying almost at a distance from hunters on a sand strip to Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The resters jumped on their feet as soon as they became understandably concerned about the noise of the aircraft's engines, but were unable to see what was going on in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveira in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of the several vacationers who published the shocking social media video, said, "He flew very low twice, and there was a moment, at some point it seemed to break."
Nono Arroga added, "I was surfing and I swear it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were horribly frightened when the plane appeared out of fog and flew at extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was flying in a training flight to detect fishing boats off the coast, and was forced to descend so low, as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot stated that the plane flew a little lower than usual because of the lack of visibility caused by the smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today made a statement that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances of the thick fog and the swam from the forest fires, which made the appearance worse
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to detect fishing boats as part of the mission
The HASSP system has been required for over a year to be used, but most restaurants and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Tests are increasing, and the business faces fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - is required for the use of food by the growers and transporters, as well as for general stores in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Rosklnadzor's business has begun to meet these standards in Petersburg in February 2015.
But so far, officials only issue fines for certain breaches of the rules (see "List of documents" ...).
A total of 600,000 roubles for the first offence and 1 million roubles for the second would be required for failure to comply with the regulations.
The HASP as a system that takes into account and prevents food risks was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of food for astronauts.
The system is now being used in all food factories not only in the US, but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, the HACSP has been operating on TS.
Business was 4 years old for the design and implementation of the system (the HASSP requirement was introduced into the PC system in 2011).
However, both employers and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food production and not to restauranters,” explained the head of the Public Council, Helena Creteli.
Now everybody's trying to catch up.
The expected date for the reopening of charter flights to Turkey is late August and early September.
But they won't call for a huge demand, because their target audience -- families with children -- is already getting ready for school, experts say.
The travel agency's alliance sent a letter yesterday to the government asking for a charter to be allowed now.
“For many Russian tourists, the question of the selection of quality and accessible seafaring is an intractable one, since most of the places in the resorts of Krasnodar and the Republic of Crimea have already been booked before the end of September” notes the authors of the letter and stresses that the opening of chartered transport operations in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for Russian seafaring products.
As reported at the Northwest Regional Office of the Russian Touring Union (RTU), in the event that Russian and Turkish air administrations quickly agree, the return of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding, when the charters resume, does not yet depend first and foremost on the air authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even August, if the tourist operators quickly build programs and arrange with the airfares for the aircraft to fly,” says Pavel Rumentsev, Vice-Director of Communications and International Projects of the Northwest Regional Office of the RST.
According to him, the possible resuming of the charters is good news, but it doesn't have much impact on market power, because the main customers of the charter tours -- families with children -- have already returned from their vacations and are preparing for school or taking vacations in other countries.
In the velvet season, tourists are mostly single travellers and couples.
Charter programs can rely on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously," says Pavel Rumenski.
"Turkish has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it's about to offer a very budget offer -- 50,000 to 60,000 roubles per tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, Director General of the Optio-Travel Touring Authority.
Otherwise, it's certainly not worth counting on, because most of the trips are already planned.
Pavel Rumentsev also believes that since regular flights to Turkey have a demand, charters will be demanded, but the wait is not worth waiting for.
"For Turkey, launching the charters now is the next season's rehearsal," said Pavel Rumenski.
"Opening a charter to Turkey is good news for the next season," says Valeria Rubtsov.
The tax code provides for the release from the NDFL of legal compensation payments, within the limits of approved rules for compensation for damage caused by an injury or other damage to health.
The granting of milk to workers engaged in work with dangerous working conditions is provided for under article 222 of the Criminal Code.
However, the rules and conditions for issuing are set by order of the Ministry of Health and Development of the Russian Federation of 16 February 2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, free distribution of milk or other equivalent food is made to workers on days of actual employment in jobs with dangerous working conditions due to the presence of dangerous production factors in the workplace.
On the basis of the above-mentioned rules, the Russian FNL concluded in the present letter that, on the basis of article 217, paragraph 2, paragraph 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, incomes in the form of the value of milk paid to employees on days of actual employment in jobs with dangerous working conditions are excluded from the application of the decree of 16 February 2009 No. 45n of the Ministry of Health and Development of the Russian Federation.
The Moscow Gastrobank has been denied a CB license.
On Friday, August 12th, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked a license to conduct banking operations with a credit organization.
According to the controller, AKSA GUSSTROIBANC had a highly risky credit policy to place money in low-quality asset.
A proper risk assessment at the request of the observatory and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank's asset have led to the credit organization's reasons for taking measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in suspicious transit operations.
The bank has a temporary administration until the time of appointment to a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization under federal law have been suspended.
AKB GASSTROYBANK is a member of the deposit insurance scheme.
It should be recalled that the payment of insurance compensation to bank depositors, including individual employers, under Federal Act No. 177-FZ “On the insurance of natural persons' deposits in banks of the Russian Federation” is provided for in the amount of 100 per cent of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total per investor.
Payments, according to the Treasurer, will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the records, the AKB GUSSTROIBANC AOO held 335 seats in the Russian banking system as at 1 August 2016.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIL died in Syria
Cadiz Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, was reported to have died in Syria.
Tasnim Akunji's lawyer said that her family found out about her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died as a result of a Russian air strike in Raqqa, a wing of a group in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she was planning to leave a war-torn country and return to England.
"We can only hope that the only advantage of all this -- like a tombstone and a will to others -- is that these are exactly the risks that we're talking about when we go to the war zone -- to convince people to ever make the same choice," said Akunji.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family said that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and had been widowed for months.
Reid claims that he will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the position of Chief Justice if elected.
The leader of the democrats in the senate, Harry Reed, says that he is convinced that the democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton will be nominating Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republicans of the senate blocked Garland's claim, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The head of the majority group in the senate, Mitch McConnel, states that the next president will choose the man who will be able to replace the last judge of the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reid announced at the conference on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with a certain degree of confidence."
Reid's representative later said that he had not talked directly to Clinton about whether she was going to press Garland, and she was just making suggestions.
He complimented Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to rock the boat with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are the "receivers" and "assistants" of the Republican President's candidate, Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not suitable for the job.
Treats claims that erotic calendars for 'female as well as for men'
The magazine "Treats" works with photographer David Bellmer to release the calendar for the year 2017, inspired by the Pierelli of the 1970s.
But instead of nude celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their calendar for 2017 with nude music.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with many nude models is different from old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I'm making it for women.
Obviously he thinks the calendar is too.
"We need to go back to the demonstration of a permanent and classic nude figure, where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," said Shaw in a press release that announces the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful artwork.
Models can provide photos online or personally in open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will be given memos about unscrupulous internet stores.
In Moscow, they're going to issue a memo that tells us how not to become a victim of an Internet store.
This was reported in Roskilnadzor, writing M24.
It is reported that government officials are preparing a memo that will help citizens to properly select online stores and recognize possible fraud schemes.
The concept of this leaflet contains several sections.
This will be general information and a legal framework, rules for the delivery of goods, and ways to protect their legal rights.
The appendix will contain recommendations on how to properly draft the claim and so on,” Rossislavnadzor reported.
The note is currently being prepared.
It will then be published on the Rosklznadzor website for Moscow, and will be published and distributed by Moscow.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia published a statement in which it named the second suspect in the organization of a subversion in Crimea.
Citizens of Ukraine and Russia who have assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts have been arrested.
Among them are Mr. Evgenius Alexanderov and Mr. Andrey Romanowicz.
"They all give confessions," says the report.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporoz region, Yevgeny Panov, who had been arrested on suspicion of having organized attacks in Crimea, pleaded guilty during questioning.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million roubles.
The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has ordered an administrative fine of 438 million roubles on the Google Company website.
"The price for Google for breaking the anti-monopoly law was 438 million roubles.
We hope that the company will execute our decision and pay the fine soon," said the FAS deputy leader Alexei Dozenko.
In the course of the investigation, FAS found that Google provides smartphones that are sold on Russian soil to a Google Play application store only if other corporate applications are installed on the device.
These applications include a search engine which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation is in breach of article 10, paragraph 1, of the FZ “Protection of competition” (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the requirement will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the Russian mobile software market, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The "Protection of competition" law needs to be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, among them," noted the Head of the Communications and Information Technology Authority of the Russian Federation, Helena Zaeva.
The government suspected 16 Russian stores of collusion.
The New Books Network has been fined for selling the book 50 Days Before My Suicide.
The "New Books" network is fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 Days Before My Suicide," reports the city news agency Moscow.
The text of the book may be considered as “provoking or causing suicide of children and teenagers” without specifying the amount of the fine, as reported by Roskilznadzor.
The Continent District Court confirmed that it had not complied with the requirements for the distribution of information to children and ordered a fine of 49 copies of printed material seized by the Rosklznadzor Authority.
The source in the "New Book" confirmed that it was about the work of Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookshops were being tested for a book called "50 Days Before My Suicide".
There'll be an evening in Moscow for the memory of Ernest the Unknown.
There will be a memory evening in Moscow of the artist Ernest the Unknown, reports the TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central House of Literaries.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say good-bye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
Therefore, it was decided that this evening should be arranged for those who wish to mention it in their native land,” the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress declared.
It said it was important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown were invited to attend the evening, including the poet Yevgeny Eutouchenko, artist Boris Messererer, President of the GMI of Pushkin Irina Antonov, director Mark Rosovski, as well as the Russian Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinski, head of the Moscow Department of Culture, Alexander Kibovski, and the deputy mayor of Moscow, Leonid Printnikov.
It was previously reported that the relatives of the John Doe were planning to perform a sculptor funeral in New York, presumably before 14 August.
The final consumer blamed: Who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men like vinyl.
And while you're not trying to cloak the comment section with rude insults under the alias of the Not-All-one-Men of the Middle Ages, this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouTube, so much discussion of the renaissance of records is not due to the boom of a generation of 2,000 people who want to penetrate a new material, but rather to the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high probability are between 45 and 54 years old, according to data.
Moreover, those belonging to the 18 to 24 age group are the least likely.
It's also not just an act of amateur gathering -- it's emotionally important that older customers have a slightly higher probability of holding their feelings (56% against 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% against 66%).
But is YouTube's results correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would have followed me while I was walking down the center of a lively Soho street, in a humble gray suit and a violent gesture before the stop, folding hands and saying something imaginary like, "Well, let's see."
All right, let's see.
While Soho's heart slowly loses its charm and dirt -- hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops are now filled with buildings once occupied by independent salesmen -- several music stores with fantastic professionals are still in place.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these shops, and I'm trying to measure their age and emotions with observation.
He is a 55-year-old citizen of Glasgow, who followed me from the Master Ray (calculation of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (calculation of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years old), in London for a half-day to meet, and walks through shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I suppose so," he says.
I've got about 3000 or 4,000 records.
These records, as shown above (he sent me an email picture, I didn't follow him home), run through the walls of his living room.
His reason for buying so many albums and singles is partly based on his own income: he can now buy records that he could not afford when they just came out and buy out the items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many of what I buy is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12, the things for which I was probably too young to buy," he said.
He agrees that those who buy records are probably introverts that like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
That's my fault.
Wese, 25 years old, who works for the Secreter Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouTube profile.
He noticed, however, a new wave of people affected by media noises, people who heard about their return and felt obliged to buy their old records.
Based on the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually in about 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records," he says.
This may explain the explosion among leaders of the renaissance of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of records?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store, like Phonica, to realize that record shops offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wese, some of the older clients, in particular, are insulted by the cash-free payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may experience a shock from the digital world and prefer to withdraw to the constant familiar records envelopes, objects that awaken memories of a quiet youth.
"I think sometimes it might be filling a void or possessing material things as a sort of comfort," says Wes.
Since I'm a collector myself, I've got it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's a simple way to take over.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the plate shelves.
An ICM poll in April showed that nearly 50 percent of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl have no record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably seem seriously puzzled by gleaming the shelves of Bosanowa.
The "triple" aspect of the renaissance is what Johnny, who is 42 years old, has been working at Sounds of the University (calculation of data: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a radiohead so we can put it on our shelf," he says.
It's not a high percentage, but it certainly happens.
More of a piece, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older, they're a little under 20, who just get to know it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples over 70, tourists taking pictures, teenagers, and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, the last single and sexy pope of the Wild Beast, rather than the jazz improvisation, runs through columns, and it's nice to see the variety in their clients.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to find a 30-second stay next to someone.
Eleonor, 27 years old, walked on Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available on the market.
She looks at goods instead of spending money.
She doesn't earn much, she says, so collecting records is not a good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but beauty vinyl is ..." she dives into dreams with a breath filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it -- it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl amateurs: City fashionists.
While I'm creating an illusion that I'm looking at the jean-covery shorts, I'm watching a group of teenagers going around a Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter start talking about buying a Crosley player.
On the left there is a staircase with the walls of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Wynhouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of modern style and classics, binding plates for any medium collection.
No one looks -- perhaps because they are just ornaments, some are placed so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "bright vinyl."
But given that any attention to these things can mean more money to the industry and send a few clients to the Soho for a while, there's hardly anything to complain about.
Not surprisingly, a layer of population that is more likely than most people have more time and money than most people have is one that spends most money on luxury goods like vinyl.
But as long as my findings show that YouTube results are accurate, at least in Soho records stores, they don't rule out the existence of a huge number of female vinyl collectors and amateurs that exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working all over school or offices.
But they obviously don't spend Thursday morning, walking around to the Berwick Street record store, gleaming the records and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake host who hung over the shoulders of unthinkable middle-aged men.
The Greenland polar shark, the longest-lived vertebrae animal, is a video report
Scientists claim that a Greenlandic polar shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nilsen, who studies these sharks, claims that the record is 272 to 512 years old and 5 meters long.
The French court refuses the offer to demolish the shops in the Jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer of the Kale authorities to tear down dozens of home-made shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the trial this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to demolish a total of 72 home-made shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40 p) or simple meals for several euros in home-made restaurants.
Prefecture Calais has argued that these places must be demolished because they are a parallel economy that pays no taxes and because they carry fire and health risks.
The humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, arguing that free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing population in the camp.
They said that homemade shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
Lille's court held that there was no legal basis to banish the people who run 72 home shops, but stated that the problems of the Calais prefecture were "understood."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that shops, cafes and restaurants played a much larger role than just feeding people who "live under extremely delicate conditions."
He said that space provided a peaceful meeting point for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of being demolished was the Children's Café Jungle Book at the camp, which does not work for profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes and advice on shelter for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escort in the camp.
Over 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closing "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not older than eight years old."
Two charities, helping the refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday, estimated that the jungle camp had grown to over 9,000 people, the highest in history, after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.

Britain stops at silver in rugby 7 after Fiji's master class allows them to take gold.
The striking British series in Rigby 7 was overwhelmingly stopped at the final obstacle by the Fiji team to the finals on Thursday evening, when they were completely destroyed at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji was given a master class in ball ownership, dispersal, evasion, game support, line runs, and rough power to win gold, their first Olympic Medal of any colour.
The fall came with not too little comfort in the form of silver, the third in Britain in a day, and they could be proud of their efforts at the first Rigby 7 Olympic tournament, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated along the way.
The ill beating of Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier that day, could have returned to affect them in the finals.
But, no matter what, Fiji, in this form, won the best team of 15 people.
This may be a bit of a comfort to Britain — but probably not — that at least one British man will put a gold coin on his neck tomorrow: Fiji's Chief Trainer, Ben Ryan, the former Chief of England from Wimbledon.
It was a bit of a voyage for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they only lost one.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji had begun brilliantly for fun by beating up Britain's attempts to catch the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Ocea Collinisau dived into a corner.
With four minutes on the watch, Gerryr Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank, which was realized.
12-0 and Britain had barely touched the ball.
The brilliant attempt to intercept Mitchell kept the man-mounter Leon Nacarov from beating a third, but it only delayed Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown at the right corner, and the UK was losing 17-0.
Nacarava added another one after resuming and there was still more than a minute... in the first half.
Watemo Ravovo then broke through several more sluggish attempts to intercept the UK and stormed the line to get a point.
The implementation led to a 29-0 break.
It looked as if Fiji had been born to play rugby 7 while the UK was still mastering the trade.
Which, to a large extent, is true.
The UK was making massive replacements for half the game, and they blocked the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which, by the first half's standards, was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for the United Kingdom, making a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game long followed the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the complete joy of Fiji's approach.
Mata William decorated the Fijian cake, which did not need decoration, with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-final, and the United Kingdom had slightly outstretched South Africa in a tense semi-final attempt by everyone, the difference between the British implementation.
Kyle Brown brings Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some wonderful legwork, broke the line and beat under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, a 15-year-old brother to the British team, Anthony, secured a victory -- and eventually a silver coin.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the coach's row against cancer.
There'll be no more exciting gold at these games, and that's saying something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy climbs to history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an added value of their gold moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
While they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always as long as they sought the second consecutive olympian gold in women's couples, the first women in British sport's annals, who had reached such a height.
Their superiority was absolute; at last it was their 39th unfailing performance, again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant sportsmen, slipping over the surface with the elegantness of swans, do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind each gold was a ready-armed battalion that contributed to gradually growing victories that mattered, and there were no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see the day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, it goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your species a little for the future.
William was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio's lucky to be able to start the treatment early in 2014 in the inter-season, keeping the break-up schedule as low as possible, if that might be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed payment, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the department -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, though they were talking enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The eye itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
The moment after their victory, their first thoughts were about William, who spent the nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, a captain of an artillery regiment with a service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said, "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a bit too much, but it means so much."
It just proves how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner to train or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
This couple has a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even on the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were really in phase.
Helen called out, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's very important not to get involved right now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting to get out and win this race, which we did.
It'll take a year for a couple to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, at her own with a TV adventure hunter, Steve Baekshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I had become the champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government has extended the destruction of sanctions products
The government extended until the end of 2017 the destruction of food prohibited for entry into Russia.
The decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The ban on countries that had introduced anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
The ban has since been extended repeatedly and is now in force until December 31, 2017.
Russia is not allowed to import some of its agricultural, raw and food products from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and dairy products were prohibited.
The removal of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been taking place in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were removed from the market.
Hunting for "prohibited"
Rains and thunders are expected in Moscow on Friday.
There will be an atmospheric front across the metropolitan region that will precipitate and lower the temperature of the air.
The air will warm up to 25 degrees in the afternoon.
So on Saturday night in Moscow there will be short-term rain, possible storms and wind waves up to 15 m/s.
Rain is expected during the day with storms and wind waves up to 12 to 17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also predicted in Orlov, Kur and Voroneje region, reporting "Days.ru".
Next week, the precipitation is unlikely.
The WTO Arbitrator Panel found that Russian import duties on paper, fridge and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rate exceeds the obligation assumed by Russia upon its accession to the World Trade Organization.
"This is the first time the World Trade Organization has made a decision against the Russian Federation," says the official website of the organization.
However, the arbiters stressed in their opinion that the European Union had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures were “systematic” or “common in nature”.
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt imported duties to paper and fridge soon.
This is mentioned in a report from the Russian Ministry of Economic Development.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia's actions, which had placed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in a statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May Financial Times wrote that US behaviour in settling issues in the World Trade Organization undermines the organization's principles of discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other members of the World Trade Organization because the Americans refused to approve the second term of Judge Chan Song Hwa of South Korea.
Therefore, Russia would not apply to the World Trade Organization for Western sanctions against the Russian Federation.
The World Trade Organization was an international organization set up in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now composed of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The president's administration has been replaced by a leader.
President Vladimir Poetin of Russia has appointed former deputy Sergei Ivan Anton Wyno as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Poetin reorganized the President's administration and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Wyno stated during the meeting that he considered the anti-corruption work that he had begun as head of President Ivanov's administration and had pledged to work with the Government.
Previously, the news said that experts considered Sergei Ivanov's retirement from the post of Chief of Administration to be transparent and comprehensible, and reshuffling would not fundamentally change the operation of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader who had been working for a long time in the President's administration has effectively built up the AP.
He was replaced by the deputy head of administration Anton Wyno, a man who knows very well the specifics of this job.
In Poland, it is assumed that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The Polish State Oil and Gas Company PGNIG does not rule out that after a few years the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it due to the redirection of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice President of the Polish Finance Company, Bogoslav Majec.
His words are passed on to the TASS.
"Perhaps it happens that we're not going to buy any gas at Gazprom, we're now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be East, SPG-Terminal raw materials and Norway," said Majetz.
Gazprom is currently dominant in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, August 12th, PGNIG reported that a Russian vendor had supplied almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first six months of 2016, 30 percent above the level in 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in the purchase of PGNIG rose to 49.8 per cent, compared to 40 per cent a year earlier.
On 22 July, the Polish Antimonopoly Authority did not agree on the establishment of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners to build the Northern Flow-2 gas pipeline.
This month, Poland left a request to Gazprom for 11 billion cubic metres of gas on Northern Flow-2.
Alexander Medvedev, Vice President of the Holding Board, said so.
The North Flow-2 auction will take place in 2017 and the auction is scheduled to take place in the fall of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action in connection with the Polish party's intention to withdraw long-term gas supply from Russia after 2022, and Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the company, said.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year Polishs had only increased by 42% the purchase of Russian gas.
The substitute for Gazprom added that the mere fact that a Polish PGNIG application had been filed with the Stockholm Court of Arbitration did not mean the termination of the talks.
The Polish company had previously turned to the court in order to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall that the Polish Government's Gas and Energy Authority, Peter of Nayim, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the Gasprom contract for the supply of gas.
The Polish contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government's gas and energy infrastructure commissioner, Peter of Nayim, declared that his country could refuse to supply blue fuel from the east in six years.
He said that Warsaw was planning to build a new terminal for the supply of liquid natural gas to the Baltic Pipe, which would connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
Northern Flow-2 provides for the construction of two sea gas pipeline threads with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres a year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has increased the number of observers near Ukraine's border with Crimea.
Alexander Hug, the first head of the SMS in Ukraine, reported this.
"I can confirm that the SMS has increased the number of observers in this field," he said, in answer to a question from the journalists, he sends "RlA News."
According to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm and there are no security incidents.
Observers monitored what was happening at three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a passenger jet, Yak-42, landed at Ufa airport on the Internet, rolled out of the airstrip by 400 metres and fell onto the left wing.
The video was published by "360".
The emergency occurred at 4:30 Moscow time.
The flight of the Airlines has arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a secure location, no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to a parking lot.
Ufa airport works normally.
The Civil Investigative Department of the RPCR has been working to determine the reason for the heavy landing of the plane.
The UN investigates the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission investigates the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian town of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict denied the use of Chlorine, but the UN Special Messenger for Syria, Stephan de Mistura, considered the fact that it had happened to be undeniable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of the inter-Syrian talks, which should start at the end of August in Geneva.
UN experts have begun to investigate reports of chemical weapons use in the Syrian town of Aleppo.
First information on a poison gas attack, suspected to be a Chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that, in the area where the Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, the aircraft had dropped a poisonous bomb, but in Moscow the charges were called a dump.
The Russian Ministry of Defence later accused the opposition group Harakat Noor Al-Din al-Zinqi of having happened.
Soon it was reported that the bombs filled with poisonous gas were two.
This was confirmed by BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later I smelled gas, began to burn my eyes, became difficult to breathe," quotes the newspaper of the witness.
At least seven people died as a result of the attack and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be treated as a war crime.
The UN Special Messenger for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said to the journalists, "There is a lot of proof that this has actually happened."
The non-use of Chlorine for military purposes is set out in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
While all parties to the Syrian conflict denied the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights advocates recorded 35 cases of the use of Chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo complicates the daily shelling of its areas, while the terrorists prevent the inhabitants from leaving the city.
As Reuters reports, the UN is expecting Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in military operations.
The organization's three-hour daily tranquillity regime is considered “not enough to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped”.
Staffana de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, said that a 48-hour cease-fire would be required to get the sick and wounded to the city and to extract them every week.
"We have to send bulk goods from a truck convoy to a place where roads are almost destroyed and what remains is mined," said Mr. Egeland. "But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to join us at the negotiation table."
The consultation in Geneva between the US and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continues.
How Russia opened the "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia announced on 11 August the establishment of a three-hour regime to halt the fighting, which will take effect daily starting Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is intended to enable the delivery of medicine, food and basic goods to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation has been taken against the background of growing international pressure on Moscow to terminate the military operation and to encourage the resuming of the negotiation process.
Four people died in a series of explosions in Thailand's resorts.
Immediately several explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people died in the attack and 19 were injured.
The explosion epicenter hit the city of Hua-Hin.
Of the victims, 10 were foreign, four were Russian, and none were Russian.
No terrorist groups had yet taken responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs had hastily declared that Islamists were not involved in it.
Several people have already been arrested on suspicion of bombing.
According to the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leaders.
Attacks took place in popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the area of Phuket and in the town of Hua Hin, Thrang and Surat Thani.
Since the military junta came to power in the country in 2014 economic growth has fallen from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourists have remained one of the few sectors showing development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, an increase of 1.5 million over the rate in 2015.
The first suspects in preparation and organization of the attacks have already been apprehended, as reported by police colonel Chrisana Patanacharoen.
He added, but in the Ministry of Internal Affairs the countries are “convinced that they are not linked to international extremist groups”.
It's too early to draw conclusions,' said Mr. Patancharoen.
But we know precisely that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact, they are local subversions, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its top priorities, so the incident is probably directed against it.
According to the police general of Sithish Srisopacharonrat, the bombs were exploded remotely, with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees in lively streets filled with dinner tourists in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl selling street food.
The identities of the other victims are not yet known, but they are known to be inhabitants of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai police, four of them are German citizens, three Dutch citizens, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians who have been killed by explosions, and Rosturgy's press service has reported.
The local experts have also linked the explosions to the referendum held on 7 August, in which 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution-making commission appointed by the military junta.
The voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role to play in the election of the Prime Minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the parliamentary elections of 2017.
On 22 May 2014 a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the military commander of Praut Chang-Ouch.
To that end, he said, the army had contributed to the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in the talks between the Government and the opposition.
The military created the National Peace and Order Council, introduced curfews and censorship, and dispersed protesters and the Upper House of Parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by the premier, Yingluck Chinawat, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014 in the centre of Bangkok, two explosions occurred at the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, affecting 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions caused unknown explosions on motorbikes.
The authorities increased security in the capital and engaged military forces to protect the demonstrators.
In Dry Loga, the development of conditions has begun.
The Government has been asked to agree on the draft terms of the gold-mining auction for the Dry Logh field, while maintaining two key restrictions.
It is suggested that a company with 25 per cent and more foreign ownership and those whose capital will not contain at least 25 per cent of State participation be excluded from the auction.
The industry does not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are not at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August, and it can be held in October.
The Ministry of Nature has submitted a draft auction policy and conditions to the largest unexplored gold mine in Russia, Dry Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), and has told two sources of "OK" familiar with the situation.
The project was submitted on Wednesday evening, and one of them is explained.
The Ministry of Nature has confirmed that the project has been submitted to the government.
Alexander Cloponin's vice-premier's representative said, "OK," that the project had not yet been submitted to the office of the official.
"The auction may be announced in August as soon as the government order has been issued, and given the time frame for soliciting bids from potential participants (at least 45 days) may take place in October," said the Ministry of Nature.
According to OS, the project had two key requirements for potential participants, as described in the version, which was sent to the ministries and FOIVs for consultation in July (there is an OS).
The first is the presence of at least 25% of the State's capital.
The second is the denial of access to auctions for companies under the control of foreign investors based on an understanding of FS-57 on investments in strategic societies.
According to the two articles mentioned in the draft, the FP, as it had already written on 2 August, may not be allowed to auction by a company whose clients are 25% of the shares or above, are not tax resident in the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship.
The government has the right to introduce such restrictions, since Dry Log is a part of a federal reserve (over 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies” but refused to comment on the details before the government ordered it.
The requirement of State ownership of the auction was put forward by the Irkutsk Region, spoke "OK" in December 2015, and later confirmed by the governor of the region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, who "had an investment agreement with Rostech".
Those who lobbyed for the alien's admittance limit don't specify.
"But it's in the spirit of time: don't give control in Russia's largest gold field against Western sanctions," reasoned a conversation with the "Oz" familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The Head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donski, declared on 1 August that aliens "can go to the consortia" if the applicant engages them "as a financial entity, as technology partners."
The interviewees think it's unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main applicant for Dry Log in the industry is the largest gold miner of the PAO Pole, which was controlled by Suleiman Kerimov Said's son, and Rostech's.
In July, the partners created the SPE Gold, where the Pole has 51% shares, and the RT-GR has 49%.
In Rosteche, comments were discarded, in the Pole, they said "unquestionably, interested in this asset" and had all the necessary competences and resources to develop it.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the declaration of conditions," added in the Pole.
AFROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision of the government of the Russian Federation was said by the sources to be "OK."
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which are developing the Chukotka asset, have announced the possibility of participating in the development of the Dry Loga, while Polymetal and Nordgold are not interested in the asset.
Sergei Kashuba, the head of the Union of Gold Producers, estimated the "OK" investment in the Dry Log in December 2015 at $2.5 billion to $4 billion.
Most potential bidders are deterred not only by the volume of investment but also by the complexity of the project: there is a need to seriously explore the stocks and technologies of handling complex ores, explaining the "OW" in the industry.
On the pension market, the largest M&A deal, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, began a process of merging four controlled NFPs.
As a result, a NPF with a saving of about 373 billion roubles will be created on the basis of the Pension Fund.
The introduction of the process of merging the four pension funds, KIT Finance, Promagrophone, Legacy and Gaz Foundation Pension Account, was announced yesterday by the owner of 100 per cent KIT Finance Administrator.
“Reorganization shall be carried out in agreement with the CB, subject to the requirement that the terms of the existing contract remain in effect,” the company's report states.
The association is based on the Pension Fund.
According to the director of the NFP, Oleg Bjalošiski, the pooling of funds brings about a number of challenges: expanding the geographical scope of presence, concentration of resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the foundations and optimizing corporate management.
He said that the target date for the completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the pooling of the GFP, the "Gaz Foundation for Pensions" will become the largest player in the OPS market.
According to data as at 31 March, the pooled fund accumulated more than 373 billion roubles.
According to the reports on the foundation's website, the beneficiaries of the foundation's ownership, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently Anatoli Gavrilenko (through the DOO-controlled 65%) and the GFP Gazford (35%).
However, the group itself started a much later competition.
Thus, the future NPF group O1 has swallowed the Steelford earlier this year.
The joint NPF is now joining the Uralcib Foundation and the Russian Standard.
“Combination into a single structure, in addition to cost reduction, is necessary to meet structural challenges”, notes the NPF Director of the Future by Nikolai Sidorov.
Since April, the Safmar-PNF European, Education and Science and Regional Foundation have been actively involved in the Safmar NPF by the end of this year.
They will be joined by the Trust NFP in 2017.
"The pooling of funds will have the effect of increasing control over risks, operating processes and costs," remarked in the Safmar pension group.
The pause in the pooling of funds that KIT The Pension Administrator's Finance suffered may be due to several reasons is indicated by the experts.
Until recently, NFPs had not been able to purchase more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure bond output in which the group was heavily placed.
Following the amended CB Order in March this year, there are no more such restrictions on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the controller.
If necessary, the entire issue can buy out one major player," says the director of the AKRA Financial Institutes Rating Group, Yuri Nogin.
Several NPF top-15 asset managers have another possible reason for the pause to refer to the division of areas of influence and, as a result, to the appointment of a single fund that should have been agreed upon by the owners of the group.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment.
Nor did the Gazzond NFP respond to the "OS" request.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-consuming and cheap exercise, it will be justified at long distances.
According to Sergey Ocolesnov, the director of the consulting company "Pension Partner", the Gossford's retirement fund has less outflows, but it will help to stabilize the base of the other funds of the group.
In doing so, the better experience of KIT Finance and the Promographer NFP will be required in the construction of the retail sales of OPS, as well as in the use of more modern software.
The CB requirements for NFP processes and human resources are constantly rising, so it is not advisable to duplicate the infrastructure on four foundations with a single investment policy, as Paul Mittrophonov, Managing Director of Corporate Rating, "Expert RA" considers it necessary.
"The effect of reducing duplicative functions will certainly overlap the possible costs of merging," notes Mr. Mitrofanov.
Sergey Ocolesnov estimates the cost of bringing together the four foundations of 30-50 million roubles.
"The cost of four such funds is about 400 million roubles a year, with a medium-term consolidation of the budget actually halved," Mr. Ocolesnov is sure.
The Russian film featured the finest Disney film "Pete and His Dragon."
New Zealand's beautiful species, graceful dragon, persuasive history, and country-style songs are enough to rethink old-fashioned magic.
A frightened little boy picked up a dragon who became a human baby and a tender nurse and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his pal Eliot, after a puppy from a fairy tale book, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, when he was thrown into a hedgehog, he was no longer distinguished from the other clever forest wreck, Mowgli.
In this way, Pete finds a red-headed woman-herring Grace (Brice Dallas Howard), while a team of Gavin (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively bogging the woods.
Now she won't only have to believe in the dragon's existence, she'll have to help save it.
Pete's in an accelerated course of being a human being surrounded by idyllic Americans, who wear shirt-cobs, moral code in their hearts, and smile brighter than any advertisement.
No character looks or works too awfully to be really hated or frightened by the audience.
Even Gavin, who discovered the hunt for an untypical species of forests under his control, is far from being an incorrigible villain.
The huge furry dragon also turned out not to be frightened at all, with the good face of the bulldog, the airship's wingspan, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon sounds funny, shrieks, even snorts, and, fortunately, doesn't say it, but it always wants to be ironed, and it's very different from all the famous movie dragons.
Eliot's visual image and manner of keeping in mind provides such a high degree of emotional engagement that, in the most tense moments, weeping desperately in three streams, not only by small audiences, but also by adults.
Amazingly good and young Oaks Figgles in the role of Pete, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtually gives out a canonical grandpa who would love to have literally every child.
How did the director David Lowry manage to make a fantasticly nice remake of the forgotten film "Dracon Pete" of 1977, which was mediated from the nose to the tip of his tail and remembered only by mixing animations and playing movies, and made it the most mental film this summer?
No wonder the miracle helped.
In his original picture, Lowry took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There were music numbers overboard and most of the strange jokes.
This fairy tale reads the traits borrowed from Bambi, Alien, and many other beautiful children's hearts.
Disney continues to successfully expand the 21st century high-quality remake gallery.
Of course, "Pete and Dragon" isn't as stunningly beautiful as "The Book of the Jungle," and it doesn't have the masterful villain that Kate Blanchett turned out to be a stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive film is no less successful in believing in miracles and good in the best Disney tradition.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magic castle, the director of Lowry, will be given again for the artist's design of the "Peter Pane" story.
Played in "Pete and His Dragon" by David Lowry and writer Tobey Halbrooks in a new ambitious project on a non-adulting boy in the same name story by James Barry.
RBK journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged again
The lawyers of the RBK journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organising extremist activities, stated that the prosecutor ' s office had found shortcomings in the case of their client.
We learned from the investigators that the prosecutor's office made this presentation just yesterday.
We had scheduled to attend a trial on the limitation of access to the criminal case file, but the hearing was not held and the investigators informed us of the presentation made by the prosecutor's office,” RBK quotes counsel, Olga Dinze.
She said that the prosecutor ' s office had indicated to the investigators that there was a lack of competence in the case and the material collected.
Now the investigators will have to fill the gaps in the evidence and charge Alexander Sokolov with a new charge.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CPC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Mrs. Dinze will explain.
Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015, as reported by the OS.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded the RBC journalist from the prosecution the phrases “destroying the political situation towards instability” and “disrupting power by illegal means”.
CORRESPONDENT ALEXANDR ZILBERT, CORRESPONDENT OF "Commersant Boscosport", lived in an olympics village, inspected a Russian team home, lunched in a local dining-room, and even passed a WADA test.
It doesn't seem like life is dying for a second.
Even at night.
The last launches sometimes end at midnight, after which the sportsmen need an hour and a half to get back to the village of olympics.
Moreover, settlement and expulsion from the village are taking place without stopping, as some athletics finish their performance and leave Brazil, while some are coming here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the olympics are stretched into one of the temporary shadows.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some of the operational matters of our lives, as explained by Igor Kosik, the head of the Russian sports delegation.
The hot water problem is, I'm sorry, the toilets.
We struggled for purity for a long time.
At first, nobody came to clean up.
Then they started coming in with the clinters, but they just put some stuff on the floor, that's all.
The floors are, you see, innovative.
Like, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these floors. It's common laminate.
Anyway, they got a change in the Clining Company, and now it's OK.
The Olympian village is such a South Butlow, a sleeping area, fenced on one side of the mountains, and on the other, a huge puddle, and places of flooded water.
And for the sake of security, there's a two-metre iron fence all over the perimeter, followed by automatic walkers.
A total of up to 17,000 people can be accommodated in the village in 3,604 apartments located in 31 houses.
One of the 18-story buildings has a huge Russian flag on it -- this house is completely allocated to the needs of our team.
Looking at the little foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what the most pressing problems are for the national team.
There are two advertisements at the registration counter: the printed "Please don't throw the paper into the toilet!" and the hand-held "I'll take the badges.
The bar itself drowns in the tracts.
Their cheerful bloom contrasts with the titles of the leaflets: "The Remembrance of Infectious Infections for Exiting Rio de Janeiro", "The First Help in drowning, Falling a foreign body into the airways, Loss of consciousness - the stages of cardiovascular resuscitation," "The First Help in Burns, Heat stabs, Breaks and Brushes".
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, "Infected is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not all are expected to enjoy a positive outcome.
Of course, the Russian team has a health centre which is available at any moment to provide people with skilled help, including a relaxing and sporting massage.
On the contrary, the health centre is the very head of our delegation.
Next to the door is the inspiring poster "No matter what, we'll win!"
And, of course, poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Even less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not give up, will not break!
And for even more uplifting, there is an announcement, "Dear brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia Cyril's spiritual care for the sportsmen of the Russian Olympic team, Protojere Andrey Vladimirovicz Alexeyev takes place.
You can order prayers and other demands on the phone...
In general, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religion for all faiths in the village.
And Russians, in a privileged position, they have their own chapel.
Because of the load of the elevator from the 9th floor to the 4th floor, I decided to go down the stairs recommended for use during the fire.
And in the dark stumbled upon the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, it was a sleeping employee of the new Clining Company.
I think they've decided to put a quiet time on the cold steps at any moment when they're ready to start washing innovative sex.
On the fourth floor I was expected to meet a long-time acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorowicz Dubko, a coach of our tramps, who led them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and the European champion, Jan Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
We live in two, beds, of course, are almost inoperable, but it's not critical.
The sanousel is one on four, but it's wide.
The closet is, of course, funny, of cloth, trustless, but something can be put away.
"No, you're pretending they're out of tea!" the tennis player Svetlan Kuznetsov, whom I met in the main dining-room.
It is called the main because it is a space of 2.7 thousand square metres and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors simultaneously.
They give 60,000 meals a day at the top of the table free of charge.
The menu options are: "The best from Brazil," "The world's kitchen," "The Asian dishes" and "The pizza, the pasta."
The last option, as I was looking at, is very popular with our Volleyball players.
And so, let's say, I didn't find any soup in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
What kind of soup is that?
It's a good thing I took Chinese with me.
And a teapot.
But actually, just so you know, we've got worse food on our courts.
There's something you can choose, despite the unbearable homogeneity.
I personally chose cod for steam and meatballs in tomato sauce.
A tablet with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, along with the food value of the product and its allergic contents, is placed next to each dish.
Well, it was perfectly edible, I admit.
I don't even know why that line is always at the local McDonald's.
We have our best friends, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), waiting for the fat, relaxed, warm sportsmen outside the restaurant.
It's a tricky quiz that wins a T-shirt.
Provocative, you can say!
To get a present, you have to answer at least eight of the ten questions correctly.
There are questions in Russian!--attacked by a woman from WADA.
But the wrong man was attacked.
So I'm in a patriotic mood, naturally.
The situation became more acute on the second question: "If I have received a notification of doping control, should I go to the doping control point immediately?"
I've been thinking about option B, "No, I have one hour."
Lost, so to speak, his guard.
I forgot that the WADA didn't have to wait for a relaxation.
Anyway, we have to show up right away.
And at the seventh stage of the quiz, my position became quite critical.
I somehow thought that if I had difficulty keeping a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and by the way, it's hard!), I could use bio-additions to get "additional nutrients to improve my productivity."
No, they won't!
In fact, the answer is worded in a way that categorically does not forbid, but is strongly discouraged in several sentences.
This WADA is not playing fair!
How's it going, Russia?--a mockingly asking the lead quiz.
There's nowhere to turn back, behind Ephesus, behind Isinbayev and our entire bloodless team.
So I focused, and I won out of the least of my strength a miserable shirt.
Know what they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I went to the fitness center next door.
I'm interested in calculating the simulators.
It's 250.
It was surprising to note that no Russian sportsmen had been found in this accumulation of trails.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let someone who doesn't know how to play train!
And here's one of our guys sitting in a nearby health centre.
In line for the eye specialist.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
The health centre, as well as the entire village, has a device for the distribution of condoms.
Thereupon it is written an incisive call: 'Continue with the confederation.'
And then all you have to do is spin a piece of iron that looks like a door lock handle, and a condom made from the natural latex of the Amazon will easily fall out of the machine.
I've got one to remember.
Athletics don't get away with it, they've got 450,000.
A whole entertainment center is available for the holiday and leisure activities in the village of Olympia.
There's an educational tablet next to him, reminding us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day in various ways on sportsmen.
The center is filled with video games, billiard and tennis tables, board soccer and ice-hockey, and some strange devices like video apps.
What is this?--I'm interested in a fellow in the form of a Ukrainian team that actively uses a wild toy.
You could, of course, just say that you don't want to talk to a person in the form of a Russian team, that's all.
Here, by the way, there's some strange conjugation in the eyes of the guys in the yellow-blue.
The most playing team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the village by looking into every corner of the village.
But if you walk rather than drive electric carts, you'll get a Canadian team home with a moose at the entrance and a tent with a restoration bath, a ticket office, a laundry, a dry cleaning, a hairdresser, a flower shop, a shop with daily goods, and mail with unique stamps (only you won't be able to wait out of the queue of Chinese philatelicists), and a bank, and a collection, and a photographic shop.
And late in the evening, you will sit next to the olympic tree, shrouded with coloured ribbons, in memory of the world's friends and relatives of the athletes who left.
And you'll be part of a machine that randomly sprays the insect-destroying fluid, and you'll think of the eternal.
I mean, the olympics movement.
Which doesn't stop for a minute in this village.
While the rest of the Russian world was holding its breath as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know that the news that Inna Derígolov won the gold at the X21 Games was the first.
Maybe I'm the only Moscowman who's ever seen it happen--not counting those, of course, who watched the competition at Carioca that night.
Only a true fan can understand that.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors at the bottom -- as always by 1:00 a.m. -- wake up and begin to shout at each other hatelessly, but very loudly.
And threatening to move furniture.
There's a crane in the kitchen-- there's no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
There's nothing in the TV calendar that's clear, so I just kept track of the March, the First and, just in case of Russia, though it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is the home of repetitions, all the sports there are somehow recorded.
There's live shows broadcast.
Hope, of course, on "Match"--the whole evening a young man shouted in news stories first about the great half-final of Deri-Shanaev, then about the coming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show you.
But instead, basketball is US-Australia.
By the way, I can't say anything wrong with that decision.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They put the Americans in the spot with their own greatness.
As a result, we have lost, but as we now see it, the basketball tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all right, but there's a fight coming up with Dee Francesca, and there's no change on the screen.
In the slightest panic, I'm starting to send channels.
It feels like it's the second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep, to the cables.
Not at any of the Matches' theme fencing.
And, as I feel, the fight is about to begin.
I don't like texting and tweeting some sports sites.
Sudden surfing produces unexpected but brilliant results.
On the First site, it turns out that there is a direct technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at this point in time.
Calling for a fencing, getting a gold fight.
Derivell's perfectly counterattacked, goes up his glasses--and quite evidently begins to take time.
The Italian woman plays almost the whole part.
Ours is one point ahead, a little more than two seconds to the end.
Dee Francesca throws himself at Deriveau, then retreats, the time is running out, the Italian woman gives the shot.
Victory!
In a couple of seconds, an olympian messenger on the phone reports a fourth gold coin.
So I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
Mad, faithful, involved.
The Moslems ' spiritual government (DOM) of Tatarstan refuses to use Russian in the Moslems.
Yesterday the DUM Plenty obliged its imams to preach Friday only in Tatar to make young Tartar learn their native language.
The government states that this “does not in any way interfere” with the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some Moslems, Casani complains that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60% of the parishioners, including foreign students, immigrants and the Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons will not reach the entire audience.
Yesterday, the DUM Tatarstan Plenty decided by unanimity to hold Friday sermons in the Moslems of the Republic in only the Tatar language.
As Tatarstan's mufti Kamil Samigullin said, this should be an incentive for young Tartars to learn their native language.
"For those who say it's heavy," Mr. Samigullin promised, "we intend to organize the Tatar language classes at every large shrine at no cost."
He added that "the decision has already come into effect" and today, in all the shrines of the sermon, "must be in Tatar."
He recalled that the DUM Tartarstan publishes a magazine called Sura with typical Tatar-language sermons.
The imam, who doesn't speak enough Tatar, "can prepare for it thoroughly."
THE DUM of Tatarstan brings together more than a thousand parishes in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the Mufti, in the areas of Friday, the preaching work is carried out only in Tatar.
At the same time, the Russian language used previously in a number of Moslems in Kasan.
In particular, as the Mufti indicated, this was practiced at the Burneyev Mob, Zakobanna and Enilaire.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed that the leadership was trying to ensure that all students knew both the national languages of the Republic, regardless of their ethnic background.
"No harm can be said to Netar Muslims," said Mr. Muhammetshin, explaining that the sermon itself "is not a binding part of the prayer."
However, the prayers themselves will continue to be spoken in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will be kept in the Moslems.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "OK," that there was no serious threat of removing the Tatar language from the shrine.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are said to be not used in the Republic's sermons.
The decision of the DMG was strongly supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress.
The head of the WCT Department, Rinat Zackrow, said "unclearly," "Meceti are an important part of our national life."
It would be unfortunate if the Tatar language were gone from this field.
He pointed out that the only way to preach in the Tatar language is to "wish the imams themselves," but that in the VCT they're "believing it right."
The imams interviewed, who preached in Russian, are willing to execute the decision of the DUM, but believe that the clergy will have difficulty understanding.
Both the Tartars and the Russians go to the Temple.
A lot of people don't understand the language.
Of course, they'll be a little tight.
"It's time to rebuild," says the Imam of the Burneyev Moslem Farhat of Mavlettin.
He said that Russian-language sermons were even closer to many Tartars, since "Russian in both schools and in nursery schools, on radio everywhere in the first place."
However, he believed that the Moslem would be able to continue its lessons and lectures in Russian on other days.
We rely on God.
He concluded, "God will show you a way out of this."
But about 60% of us don't speak Tatar.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azeri.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"So we've been in Russian for four years," says the imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language the sermon will be "to reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience."
But we will obey the decision of the pulpit.
Just the result of the sermon will be different.
But time will.
"I, for instance, will only be relieved because the Tatar language is my native language," concluded Abdulla Galiullin.
Former Director of FSIN has been brought to trial
The Moscow prosecutor ' s office confirmed the prosecution of a criminal case investigated by the SDRG concerning theft of the budget allocated to the Russian Federation ' s FSIN.
Alexander Reimer, an ex-head of the prison department, and his deputy, will appear before the court, causing more than 2.7 billion roubles to be damaged by the FSIN.
The capital prosecutor's office sent a criminal case to the Zamovoret Rice Court against the former director of the Russian FSIN, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy, Nikolai Crivolopov, and the Director of the FGL, Information and Technology and Communication Centre of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FGUP of the PITOS), Victor Odedenov.
Depending on their role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged by the SCR ' s Office for Moscow under article 285, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code (abuse of authority with grave consequences), article 59, paragraph 4 (fetched fraud, by using their official position, in an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Kryvolopov is charged under article 222 of the Criminal Code (illegal purchase and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, between 2010 and 2012, the individuals in question stole from the State treasury the budget allocated by the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for those under control, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal the budget, the team developed a scheme under which the CITOC FGCO, under its control, with which the relevant government contracts were concluded, produced technical controls and controls, including electronic bracelets, and carried out at prices which had been overstated several times.
Despite the fact that CITOC's FGCO did not have production equipment, buildings or facilities to build the final cycle of the production of electronic bracelets, five government contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles were concluded between it and the Russian Federation's FSIN.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles were found in the accounts of the Samar branch of the FGKP, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
The investigation suggests that more than 140 million roubles of cash in cash were received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office from an accomplice for whom a criminal case has been assigned to a separate proceeding.
Nikolay Cryvolopov, who had been involved in the frauds, had found an unknown source of the bullet to the decorated pistol, thus enabling him to be charged with additional charges.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim for damages of 2.7 billion roubles against the accused.
Hakan Schukur's football player is suspected of being involved in the putsch.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then a member of Parliament, Hakan Schukur, and searched two houses of his family.
The star of Turkish football in the 1990s, the early 2000s attacker Hakan Sukur, is wanted by the authorities in connection with the attempted coup d'état last month.
Forward, who completed his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an armed terrorist group.
This is a movement of Chisset, a society associated with a famous Turkish religious figure and oppositionist, Fethullah Guelen.
It is his President, Erdogan, who considers himself the organizer of the military coup attempt that took place on 15 July.
Fethullah Guelen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities are demanding his surrender.
Local media reports that a warrant has been issued for the arrest of Hakan Schukur and that police have already searched two houses belonging to a former footballer's family.
According to the investigation, his father also joined the Fethullah Guillena organization, in addition to Hakan Sukkur.
However, neither the former football player nor his loved ones were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a former football player, Hakan Sukur defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and promoted the country.
He spent most of his career at Galatasarea.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".
True, he had not spent more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shoekur is still the most successful player in Turkey, with a total of 112 games for the national team and 51 scored ball.
In 2013, Hakan Sukur left his position as a member of the parliament due to the beginning of a corruption investigation into Erdogan's party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists had been arrested in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of contributing to the military coup and of having links with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Guelen, who lives in the United States.
Due to the seriousness of the charges, media officers can wait for long prison sentences, from 10 years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalowski wants to create a network of cinemas for domestic movies only.
"I would have set up a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian movies, for which tickets cost about two or three times as much as those of foreign production," he said.
Mr. Konchalowski notes that Russian movies are hard to compete for a viewer with large Hollywood ribbons.
We've got over 100 paintings in the country a year, with an average of 20 to 25 ribbons coming up.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with Transformers and "The Iron Man," in which huge budget is pumped," said the film director.
On 1 July, the All-Russian youth education forum "Tavrida" was launched in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanities from all over Russia and from a number of countries of neighbouring and distant abroad.
The British won the olympian gold in the academic row in twos
The British Helen Glover and Heather Stanning won the gold in the academic row in twos.
The silver was taken by the New Zealand women Rebecca Scone and Genevieve Beren, and the third was taken by Anna Anderson and Hedwig Rasmussen of Denmark.
New Designer promises to deliver Zenith Arena by December 26th.
The new designer of the St. Petersburg stadium, which is expected to host the Cup of Confederations 2017 and the 2018 World Cup, promises to rent the lease by December 26th, reports to RIA News, with reference to Vadim Tulpov's Head of the Federation's Provisional Commission for the World Cup 2018.
"Today we visited the building with the Russian Minister of Sport, Vitaly Mutko, and we were with Vadim Alexanderov's head of the "Metrostria" project.
He said he'd sell the stadium by December 26th.
It's a serious peterburg company, and it never breaks the deadline.
Vitaly Mutko and I have remained content with what we have seen and heard," quotes the interviewee's agency.
Earlier, Vitaly Mutko had come to St. Petersburg to inspect the location of the upcoming large-scale competition.
Mr. Tulpov also indicated that his Sovfed commission would continue to monitor the progress of the construction of the stadium and would regularly visit the construction site.
Remember, yesterday it became apparent that Metrostre would complete the construction of Zenit-Arena, the contract would cost about 4.4 billion roubles. The same company won a tender to improve the area around the stadium, and the contract price was 2.4 billion roubles. The contract with the Transstre Corp, the Transstre Engineering Company and the Transstre Engineering Company were terminated.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.
For more information on the selection of a new designer, see the "OZ" "Metrostre" in the field.
In Myassa, Chelabin oblast, the lawyer of former vice-governor Nikolai Sandakow, Constantine Akulic, was arrested.
According to the "Organian Ural", another accused's lawyer, Sergei Kolosovski, Constantine Akulic, was summoned today to the SKR investigation department of Miassa to press charges in the case of beatings of a year ago.
Constantine Akulic then went to the scene as a lawyer to help one of his participants.
"It was originally aroused against unknown persons, and now that he began to defend Nikolai Sandakow, it turned out to be a Shark," Sergey Kolosovski considered.
Constantine Akulic became the former governor's lawyer at the beginning of August.
However, half an hour before the summons of a lawyer at the MCC, the defence party was informed that on Monday the deadline for reading the case file accused of fraud was Nikolai Sandakow.
Remember, there are two criminal cases against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first case of fraud, he is accused of having pledged 1.5 million roubles to assist in the appointment of the head of the administration of Lake Yevgeny Tarasov as the mayor of Magnitogorsk.
The second criminal case concerned the bribe that Nikolai Sandakov had allegedly received from the Director of the Piton POP, Igor Kalugin, in the form of an illegal donation of at least 1.3 million roubles of property services.
For more information on Mr. Sandakow's case, see "OK" in "The Former VP demands merging his business."
The Russian copper company (RMI) is willing to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMC has undertaken to upgrade one of the oldest and most ecologically polluted companies in the country, the Karabaš copper smelter.
The Carabasian copper smelting plant was founded by an English stock company led by Lesley Urqwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was an industry of importance to the economy, and it actually ensured the vitality of an entire city.
However, in the 1990s, because of financial problems, production was halted, resulting in serious social problems in Karabosha.
In 1998 a decision was taken to re-establish the Karabash copper factory.
One of the main problems of the Karabash plant was the ecological one.
By the beginning of the 2000s, Karabash was already notorious as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation in Karabasmedi began to change in 2004, after the company became run by the Russian copper company.
The company had begun to upgrade production, which had gradually reduced the environmental burden.
This was recently observed by the governor of the Chelyabian region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited the Karabash Mede in the early days of July.
The leader of South Ural called the huge changes that had occurred with the company since the Karabatshmedi joined the RMI group.
The main effort to upgrade the Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new serno acid plant that captures up to 99.9 per cent of the metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Copper Company, Vladivod Levin, investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion roubles.
The next stage of the upgrade of the Karabatshmedian is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of three converters, sprayers and gas tracts is scheduled for late 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, a new 1 billion- rouble industrial waste-cleaning facility is scheduled to be launched at the end of 2016.
In turn, the amount of taxes paid to the city of Karabash will also increase.
For the entire period of the Tomin PCO project, from the start of the construction to the start of the second round, the federal treasury will earn 8.9 billion roubles.
And once the GCO has been put into operation, the revenue to all levels can be 80.9 billion roubles.
During the year of production in the Varene region, 346.3 million rubles were allocated to various levels of budget.
And that's the first year.
"The longer the company works, the larger the sum of the contributions," added Valerius Ulanowski.
The RMI explained that in 2015, tax payments from the Mihaeev PCO were close to 1 billion roubles.
However, the participation of RMI companies in the life and development of their presence is not limited to tax contributions.
The RMI companies help to repair and maintain schools, nursery schools, sports facilities, cultural and entertainment facilities and areas.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian copper company in Karabagh was to renovate and, in fact, to restructure the N9 nursery almost completely by 95 students.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
There will also be a landscape park on the RMI Arena, with artificial ponds, underground and extraterrestrial parks in 600 machine rooms, cafes and sports shops.
RMI Arena will allow for international sporting events.
But the main goal of this project is to make exercise and sport in a comfortable environment accessible to the inhabitants of Chelyabinsk, especially children.

The Sandholm Centre in Denmark suspected that its teenagers were engaged in prostitution.
This is reported by The Local on Thursday, 11 August.
Some teenagers, he said, told the staff of the establishment that “someone in Copenhagen is arranging for sex.
According to the publication, doubts about the shelter workers occurred after the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan spoke of similar stories in Malma.

The retiree turned the ladder into a budget beach tower.
Network users laughed at pictures of an older man installing a ladder on the beach and turning it into a spring for jumping into water.
The picture was published on several entertainment portals, as well as on a group called "My Taganrog" on Vkontact social network, which led many to conclude that the photograph was taken on the shore of the Sea of Azov.
In the comments, "innovation" was referred to as a "fiscal tower" and a "mobile tramlin."
Many commended the man for inventiveness and "small," while some remarked that the man was seriously at risk of being injured by jumping off his tower because he had set it at a low depth.
However, one of the commentators on the Pikubu portal said that it was impossible to judge the depth of the sea by taking a picture.
"First, we don't know what depth there is, the beach may be sprinkled with a sharp descent of one metre right behind the stairs, and second, even if there's a meter deep, with proper ability to jump from a pair of meters," wrote the user under the name C0JIBAMDJZ

The Charity City Court (Amor oblast) sentenced former head of the city Alexander Migulu to nine years' general-regime colony.
This is reported on Friday, 12 August, on the court's website.
Migulu was found guilty of the offences set forth in articles 286 (Excess of power), 285.1 (non-profit spending) and 285 (misuse of official powers) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation found that the official had provided a parcel of land to a friend in the village of Muhinka in December 2008 in breach of the land-law procedure.
In 2006, it illegally ordered the town to acquire a road bridge across the Chigiri River, at an overpriced price without competitive procedures and a municipal contract, as Interfax clarifies.
In addition, between 2007 and 2010, Migula, in the interest of a commercial organization under its control, changed the schedule for payments under the lease agreement for a land that had been provided for the construction of a dwelling and had also released the company from rent.
As a result, more than 5 million roubles were underfunded and about 21 million roubles were lost in the city treasury.
On 4 August, it was reported that the former town leader, who was in detention on suspicion of corruption and who had claimed to be a member of the Parliament, had failed to provide, within a time frame, signatures for the elections to the State Duma and had been removed from the elections.
Migulya was arrested in May 2015, in the Lipetsk region, and was placed in SIZO.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Thailand has accused them of bombing in the resorts of local sabotagers.
The bombings in Thailand's resorts are “local acts of suicide” and have nothing to do with the activities of international terrorists.
The police of Thailand reported this, according to Reuters.
According to the police, they had not yet been able to determine whether the explosions were connected.
The main theory is that their planners were trying to disrupt the tourist season.
It is possible that Muslims from the south are behind the explosions.
The law enforcement authorities have already arrested several persons.
To date, four dead and several dozen wounded have been reported.
Prime Minister Praut Chan-Ocha ordered additional security measures to prevent further explosions and prevent possible casualties.
There were a series of explosions at Thailand's tourist resorts on Friday, 12 August.
The facilities were set up at police stations on Phuket Island, in the towns of Surat Thani (the capital of the same-named province, where the island of Samua is located) and Huahin.
Another device planted on the beach was deactivated by the bombers.
The day before August 11th, there were two explosions in Huahin resort.
The bombs were in pots of plants and were triggered by a mobile phone call.

Messaging and postal owners must identify users and remove prohibited information - this is the brief content of the bill drawn up by the Media Communication Union (MCU), which brings together the largest Russian telecommunications operators (available in the "Messages").
The employees of the three member companies confirmed that such a project was under discussion.
In early autumn, it should be submitted to a working group led by the First Vice-Premier, Igor Sholov, speaking to the "Messages" interviewer at the ISS.
These are changes to the communications and media laws.
They provide that any “network provider that allows for the exchange of electronic messages” is obliged to identify users on the basis of the information contained in the communications operators' databases, having previously concluded a contract with them.
As well as “promptly block messages or publications containing information that is distributed in violation of Russian law”.
Otherwise, operators may restrict access to the service as decided by Roscomnadzor.

WSJ: The US is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation because of the hacking of democratic servers.
US officials are considering imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, writing The Wall Street Journal with references to sources.
It is reported that the US President Barack Obama's administration will have to officially charge an attack on Russia's servers or Russian-backed hackers for imposing sanctions.
According to sources, the F.B.I. and other U.S. intelligence services are almost confident that Russia is involved in a cyber attack.
WSJ notes that the US usually prefers not to name those who carry out hacking attacks.
The exception is the 2014 hacking of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was officially responsible.
However, last year Obama issued a decree simplifying the application of sanctions against those who carry out or encourage cyber attacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be lengthy, writing a publication.
Even if officials had concluded that the hackers had acted with Russian support, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before taking a decision on the release of information.
They will have to determine whether the situation is so serious as to heighten the tension in the two-way relationship.
It was previously reported that the Obama administration allowed sanctions to be applied against a State whose hackers had hacked into the Democratic Party National Committee servers.
WikiLeaks published an e-mail to the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with Russian authorities might be involved in hacking.
In the Kremlin, such reports were described as absurd.
FAS fined Google for almost half a billion rubles
The reason was the breakdown of competition in the mobile applications market.
The anti-monopoly trial was initiated by the Yandex.
The Russian company argued that Google gave smartphone companies access to Android components under conditions that prevented other developers from pre-installing applications, such as the Yandex.
The FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused market power and forced mobile devices to install other applications along with Google Play.
On the basis of a test, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, and notified the FAS leader Alexei Dozenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the competition law should be enforced by all companies, including transnational corporations.
Google, in turn, aims to study the solution first and only then will it be determined whether to execute it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service had recognized the company as a competition law-breaker as early as September last year and had ordered that the contract be adjusted by 18 December.
However, Google did not accept it.
Since then, the company and the agency have been engaged in judicial proceedings.
The FAS stated that, despite a fine, discussions are under way with Google on the possibility of concluding a peace agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This was the opinion of the leading analyst of Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazine also pointed out that the fine would have no effect on the users or the competition of the corporation.
He rented an apartment and then stole it for 84,000 rubles.
A 30-year-old burglar had the chance to sell the stolen household equipment.
As reported to KM correspondent in Volgograd by the press service of the Regional State Department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the previous day a member of the city-satellite had submitted a report of a robbery to the police station of Volga.
The man informed the law keepers that the unknown had rented an apartment from him.
When the owner visited his apartment, he found it completely empty, neither the washing machine nor the TV, nor the fridge, nor the lodger.
The total damage amounted to 84,000 roubles.
Soon the guards of order came to the mark of the thief.
They turned out to be a 30-year-old unemployed wizard.
The man was arrested, and he gave a confession, saying that he had already sold the stolen property.
He would now have to be held responsible for theft in the strictness of the law, and criminal proceedings had been brought against the detained person.
This year, the criminals will be notified for payment of the transport tax.
The inhabitants of the peninsula will now pay taxes on land, property and transport.
This was announced at a press conference by the head of the FDAC Office, Roman Nazzjdev.
By the end of 2016, criminal car owners will be notified for payment of transport taxes.
So far, the IRS has counted about 250,000 people who own cars.
The data on the tax payers will be provided by HICD, Rosrester.
"If, as of the first January, we will be informed of the ownership of the real estate and the ownership of the land, the following year the citizens of Crimea will be the payers of these taxes," said Roman Nazzzjev.
Allowances for payment of property taxes will be granted to the privileged categories of citizens, especially those of pensioners.
Also, under land tax, there is a system of deductions based on the advantageous category of the tax payer, but according to the head of the FSN, it is too early to say so before the year 2017.

The average annual inflation measured by the CPI in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was 0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.

The Anime effect of Snapchat is criticized as a cartoon for Asians.
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators say it's racially insensitive.
With the "Linza" tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and to play with individuality in ways that borders absurdly.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to frame a picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
The lenses are rough, distorting tools that produce more than 30 million adjusted selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become known.
The Snapchat lenses had been criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of their faces or of encouraging white faces as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them curly eyes, crooked teeth, and thick cheeks, some critics considered it to be a racist cartoon for Asians, the yellow-faced ones.
And they wondered if these repeated contradictions point to the company's larger problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, news reports and further anger in reporting on The Verge and the Motorboard were broadcast the day after Snapchat announced that it had been removed.
The company remarked that the lens was designed as a respect for characters of anime rather than as a cartoon for Asians.
But experts who know about racism have been reminded by the lens of insulting attitudes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with anime.
In an e-mail to Grace Sparpani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of photos was actively shared, she said that the lens was "intimidating and at least awkward."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the comparison of a very rough cartoon on Asians and the effects of a filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow, but highly demeaningly yellow.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, from the corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the goods that we all carry with us.
And a huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- who are more race-distorting than their older generation -- can mean that they're more likely to be expected to understand.
When one of the Snapchat lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Cathy Joo said, "This course of events is much more difficult to ignore as it used to be."
On Thursday, Joo, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to remove his account from Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that race differences were the reason for the lack of diversity in the recruitment of staff in Snipchat.
Zhu was criticized mainly by the white management of a company composed of only men and ended her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, who is herself an American Chinese woman, wrote, "They didn't have enough non-white people to make such decisions, or they have non-white people, but they don't occupy jobs where they can speak safely and openly."
Other observers share her view, dissatisfactioning that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, highlighting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the race of its staff, but according to the confidant, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented segments of the population and to actively attempt to attract domestic resources.
For her part, she said that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that this isn't going to work."
The military has distorted intelligence about ISIL, reports to the Congressional Commission
The U.S. Central Command changed its intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which gave rise to an event on the ground, and reported to the Congressional Commission in a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the task force established by the Republican Presidents of the House of Representatives Committee on FAA matters, the Committee on Information and the Sub-Committee on Military Contributors found that there was a “widespread dissatisfaction” among the analysts of the Central Command intelligence service, who claimed that the leaders were correcting their evaluation of American actions to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military agency in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence documents approved by the Centcom High Command generally gave a more optimistic picture of U.S. anti-terror action, as confirmed by the facts from the scene, and were steadily more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence services," said the news report.
"What happened in the Centcoma is not appropriate: when a high-level analysis is presented to the leadership, our military suffers," said a member of the House of Representatives, Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The management problems in Centcom are at the top of the organization.
The ten-page report deals in detail with the persistent shortcomings that occurred in 2014 and 2015, in describing and examining American actions designed to train the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain the final evidence that the Obama administration ordered the reports to be falsified, it asserts that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command's press releases, statements and testimony were much more optimistic than real events," reported the report.
For example, Centcom officials have publicly declared that a major military attack directed at the return of Mosul may begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, that's certainly known," said member of the House of Representatives Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid2014 to mid2015, the top management of the US Central Command intelligence service forged command intelligence documents to minimize the threat from ISIL in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, more detailed data will follow the report published on Thursday.
An additional, unfinished investigation of the intelligence centre is being carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
The representatives of the Democratic Party on the intelligence committee of the United States House of Representatives published their own data on Thursday, which is in line with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
"In between 2014 and 2015, the Centre set up an overly closed procedure for the production of intelligence estimates concerning ISIL and the Iraqi security forces," states in a statement by a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Shiff, the main representative of the democratic party on the committee.
This procedure, according to Shiffa, has “stalled the production of intelligence documents” and has damaged the morale of analysts and “not sufficiently reflects diverging views”.
But Shiff and the democrats claim that they found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to follow their findings as a "task or political interpretation."
Preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of the Pentagon following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commandant Patrick Evans, the representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress while the Chief Inspector was still investigating.
But he said that "the experts sometimes disagree in the analysis of complex data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics of national security."
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American bombardment in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence now asserts) is reaching its goal.
But last year's statements raise doubts as to whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide fair estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of intelligence about the Islamic State echoed the debate that took place more than a decade ago, when an intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article alleging that the administration of President George Walker Bush, because of the protests of many analysts, had expressed support for a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence about the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said that Hooker's team had concluded that, despite public claims to the contrary, the attacks on oil-producing factories belonging to the Islamic State had not led to a significant decline in the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil-producing factories to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then leader of the Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after the testimony in the senate, which many members considered to be overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced with the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The US wins four consecutive times in women's grass hockey, bringing it closer to a decisive battle with Britain.
Once three goals in a game that ended up winning Japan with a score of 6-1, Cathy Bam opened the score on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's ice-hockey team on the grass, when the Americans won the win against the India team with a score of 3-0.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says she's not sure if she would ever do something like that.
"I don't know," she said.
I'm not really the kind of person who tracks their goals.
Here's what she knows: an American score of 4-0 in the Olympics tournament, and they compete for the first place in their band with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan's loss with a score of 2-0 on Thursday.
The British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams claim to be quarterfinals, and the result of the game will determine who will be the first in their group of six teams and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid a meeting with a strong Dutch rival team, the leaders of another group, in a bit of a weather when the quarterfinals begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made a noise in their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time taking a stock-hockey club on the grass when she was three (her older twin sisters played this sport in Drexel) and joined the national team at age 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She skipped the 2008 Games when she did not make the final selection tour.
Then it came to 2012 when things didn't work out between her and her teammates.
The following year, Kohig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
"Culture change, psychological change, physical change," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we have right now.
We've completely changed our minds.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India came to the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly stiff and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative into his own hands.
She made a long passage with the ball down the left side of the field, then slid down the spiral in the middle and sharply pushed the ball to the gate, thus giving Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The victory was the first in the United States goalkeeper's champion, Jacky Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's in shock.
So did Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how good it depends on the results of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the violence of the Games, the "Day" jumps on the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Games.
The events in Rio seem to be constant and inevitable; this is a crazy combination of competition and ambition.
It's like an olympic fire itself is that burning torch that goes from archer to swimmer to gymnast, to triatlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper or eavesdropping your neighbors' conversation in turn at the cafe and not hear about Simon Bayles, Cathy Ledeki or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's a Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time player in the Games, a handsome fellow with holes on his cheeks, might well be among those famous people who are shown in the prime-time, promoted by sponsoring and life-promoting advertisements if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a photographer.
But the 28-year-old Duli, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the olympics jumping on a trampoline.
The olympic fire does not cover all events the same.
Farther from the center, partly in the shadows, there are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting with a pneumatic pistol, firing with an onions, badminton, and Taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long reigning him.
But if I'm allowed to speak timidly in defence of my personal passion, allow me to draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on the trampoline.
While trampoline jumps have been an olympic sport since 2000 when they debuted at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I have interviewed have not been aware that they are in any way an olympian sport.
It can be a region-wide ignorance.
Although the United States had sent sportsmen to the competition, they had never won a medaille in jumping on a trampoline, and their sportsmen had not entered the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share male rewards, while Chinese and Canadians share female rewards.
Dun Dun from China and Rosey McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold coins this year.
But trampoline jumps have an outsider's charm, particularly because for an uninformed ear, they're more associated with a circle college than with the Games.
Here I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a grounded enthusiast.
They do have a comical potential -- a cartoon glimpse of endless jumps -- but also the brightness of gymnastics and jumps in the water, of the two sports that they mostly combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trapolín", which means "the spring for jumping into the water."
The winners jump on a giant trampoline, flying about 30 feet into the air, and have to perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and tails) before they finally land on their feet.
They are evaluated by execution, complexity, and flight time, according to the official programme of the Games.
Thirty-two sportsmen from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The most common olympic course is to go ahead.
The candidates for the Medal must go on, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes to the back and forth, up and down the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in the view of TV cameras, the other frightening threshold: the world or the Olympic record.
This stubborn pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical, and is enough to make even the audience cry.
But it's also, in my opinion, a bit exhausting when you watch the Games.
He's giving the trampoline jump a break.
The direction of the trampoline is upwards.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps up, seems weightless, as an astronaut, flies up, then down, then without effort again up.
And they're not without competition or difficulty, but throughout the program, there's no crazy zeal for finishing, no long jumps, only a strange, graceful loss of time and gravity.
It's the closest to the olympics day.
Women's competitions, and then the finals will take place on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1 o'clock in Eastern European time; men's on Saturday, also at 1 o'clock.
The NBC will broadcast the finals as part of the day-to-day program from 2 p.m. to both days.
In the midst of the olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected that can easily be seen in the general dump.
And if consciousness growth can only be achieved by exposing male sportsmen to passionate views and lenses -- as the Wall Street Journal suggests recently to male activists from the United States -- Dooley is waiting for his new admirable crowd of fans.
"The Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a long-standing US ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrates demanding political change in Ethiopia faced violent opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally wounded during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of a rift?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, extending to an increasing number of its areas.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights advocates, the Government's reaction was violent.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of armed demonstrators.
Videos from the protest sites, allegedly taken at the end of the past or earlier this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands against the wall.
The highest official of the United Nations for human rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It was always hard to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Africa Horn project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The United States military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably, with even a new suburban train in Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia had hardly been a model of democracy -- human rights organizations were constantly mentioning government repression -- the opposition in the State had been suppressed by the fact that the dissenters had actually been silenced.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and left with no other options but to protest, the uprising will rise," said Seyoum Teshoma, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints are numerous, starting with land use, and ending with the takeover of power by a government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies completely banished the opposition and now controlled 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tension along the border with Eritrea is rising; the struggle for this uncertain, disputed border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that secessionist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo liberation front or the Ogaden national liberation front, may try to use unrest and re-arm themselves.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings that have boiled deep for a few years are now exploding.
The first seems perfectly harmless: smartphones.
In the past few years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and Internet services have improved.
Even when government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through a proxy server that hides where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized themselves for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhar, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Throughout the centuries, Amhar from predominantly Christian highlands in Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But it's also changing.
"We'll work together under a single command," said Moulat Gememez, leader Oromo.
Major protests took place in the Amhari and Oromo areas.
Many from Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have anticipated danger.
Analysts claim that he particularly recognized the first signs of discontent and used spies to extract data and neutralize the opponents.
"The present regime lacks common sense," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Dessalin, appeared out of nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that this will result in even more blood loss.
The last time Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval in 2005, thousands of people protested what analysts had said seemed to have been elections that the government had blocked and then forged results.
During the subsequent repression, many protestors were killed, although in a smaller number than in recent months, and this period of unrest went relatively quickly.
Development experts thanked Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure development, such as the new coach train and the considerable success in fighting poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growing internal discontent of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondara, a city in Amhar, attacked companies belonging to Tigray, and anti-Tigray hatred in social networks is becoming all-inclusive.
Analysts claim that the protesters have put the United States and other Western allies in an uncomfortable position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
"And this stretched rope will be hard to get through," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIL was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the last conflict that covered his election office on Friday, arguing that he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary had been the "founders" of the Islamic State's terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican party's candidate to speak to the American people in a reasonable manner.
It also put his deputy, who tried to protect him during a period of unrest, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements which he probably did not mean.
After making this suggestion at the convention on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and President Clinton had founded ISIL.
But on Twitter early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just sneaking around.
This post was directly contrary to the statement made just a day earlier when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When radio director Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remarks, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIL, the President's candidate from the Republican party did not take the opportunity.
The latest scandal broke out when Trump tried to redirect his campaign to the economy against a low rating.
Trump and Clinton spoke competitively about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to come back to the subject again.
Again using Twitter, he warned that his plans would increase taxes, and he said that he found her speech boring.
Trump used sarcasm as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he had brought public criticism about the idea that the Russians should hack into their emails, he later explained his comments, saying, "Of course I'm joking."
Such an approach allows Trump to go beyond what is allowed in political speech and to take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some of the messages that are responding among his fans, watching how they work, and then "explain" them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his remarks and knows that they're vague enough to treat them differently.
Instead of softening comments for a broad-based voice, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days, while his ratings continue to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Trump had given up with a high score in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and was at the same level in Florida.
While Trump generally tries not to apologize for the incisive things he says, he often blames his critics for misreading his words and for misunderstandings of his sense of humor.
But since Trump has received increased attention in recent months from the Presidential campaign, his jokes have made his faithful allies uncomfortable: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provoked his remarks may be.
Rudolf W. Juliani, former New York City mayor, who is one of the most famous deputy Trumps, has made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an accepted political comment," said Juliani, when asked about the validity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama the ISIL was a nearly unknown tiny organization, he called it a non-threatening, totally unjust organization, and that's why it happened because it withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which he held the post of State secretary, has allowed ISIL to develop because it has failed to settle the situation in the Middle East.
Before the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued Twitter attacks on the media for discouraging and biasing every word he says.
He bullied the poor unhappy TV experts who were trying to solve it, and he said, "They're weak!"
Some democrats ridiculed Trump's excuses as unnecessary confirmation that he was not eligible for president.
Once a crowded coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Verb coffee shop was full of cash in Williamsburg, where there was no Wi-Fi but good coffee served for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Cherie store, which took over the Verb place in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of muffins.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in a refreshing city.
"New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is in turn being updated.
The renovated Verb coffee shop opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original site.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Besides, coffee is still good.
At the head of the new Verba is Sisko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there till the end.
When one of the clients offered to offer him a new place, he said he would gladly do so.
Rodriguez, who was 36 years old, had left much behind.
Verb works with the same bagels distribution and bought the same coffee machine.
It's even fitted with old Verba cubes.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He offered a new dish.
The menu shows sandwiches with bacon, egg, and cheese, and contains toppings made of capers or roasted onions.
There are brown rice dishes.
They don't have beer in the coffee shop anymore, but they're making fresh-pressed juice.
Nine months later Rodriguez said that he had drawn attention to the constant flow of old regular clients.
"Many former clients have also been pushed out of Williamsburg," he said.
On one of the recent Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, who was 34 years old, used to live in Williamsburg and often went to Verbe.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After Verba closed, she said she had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized it was coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me in Verbe," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although that day instead of the regular ice-coffee she ordered a cup of tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, has been a dedicated visitor to Verb since 2003.
He came in before work and ordered the same thing all the time.
"At 15 o'clock, every day, as clockwise, I came, and my bagel with oil and all the stuff was prepared for me," he said.
Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes on the menu.
Rosenthal is still doing the usual order today, but one day he'll change something with bacon, eggs, or cheese on a bagel with all the stuff.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended by the fact that the soap shop had once taken over an old place.
Moreover, Soup Cherie's owners offered to make a special soap for Verb using coffee from a cold-made coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer," said Rodriguez.
The permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint, of Polish origin, also liked this coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the window to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
The local juice sales point plans to spill bottles and sell cold coffee.
There's a possibility that the coffee shop will join the next building.
For many clients, it's enough that the new Verb will put their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and said that he was killed with grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
"How long have I wanted to smell that scent," he confessed.
Depressive depressive food in the "Floppy meal"
In March 1933, shortly after taking up the office of President, Franklin Delano Rousselt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President FDR liked fancy Fifth Avenue dishes, like foie greas and Meriland Turtle Soup.
His menu this day was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes and dessert pudding from prunes.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are food history experts.
Coa's last book, "Rage in Chinese," was devoted to Chinese food in America, and Siegelman told the history of living in a flat in the Lower East Side via food in his book "The House 97 on the Fruit Garden Street."
Their new collaborative work "The Planetary", which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
In some measure of their own culinary solidarity, they met a reporter for dinner at Easynberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny little restaurant in the Flatairn quarter, which has been working since 1929, the year of the market failure.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with slices of oil, and Coe, 57, took turkey, potatoes and vegetables.
When a reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for discussion about food in the age of depression.
"The roulettes were in great demand," said Siegelman.
There was peanut roll, liver roll, bean roll.
They were made of a basic ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to be stretched out.
Imagine you ate as much peanut as you needed for dinner.
Coy winked.
"Perhaps he was lying in his stomach with a rock," he said.
During the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and fresh baked pie was served for breakfast, dinner and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. The "Foot meal" describes how the country was dealing with what suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult subject for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as difficult was the new budget: mysterious dishes, such as rolls and bakers, became the main foods; baking is "a beautiful way to take care of the scraps," remarked Siegelmann, because cooks could hide unappealable ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dry fruit.
The meat, which has been the foundation of American food for many years, has become an economical luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritious values have become more important than taste and even cooking common sense.
In research for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that age: baked onions filled with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dinner table was unsuccessful," said Coe.
Siegelman added, "It was very strange."
Peanut butter doesn't fit the liver onion at all.
This was common in many home-based recipes.
As never before and ever since, home economics professionals — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Economics Bureau, from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country's food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “contributors of the budget,” to accept the challenge and to turn a burde of sorts of rich spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"Floppy meal" is a feast of curious historical facts.
The government's reaction to hungry citizens, for example President Herbert Hoover's "let's eat pies" attitude is particularly puffy.
Publicly exalted by the simple farming of the state of Iowa during his childhood, he was eating like a sophisticated millionaire who became a millionaire.
"He liked the mainland kitchen, like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate almost in a gold-golden dining room wearing a tux.
He was fantastically distracted from reality.
President FDR could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleonor, hadn't told him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book tells us, Eleonor Rousselt employed a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, and this led to the White House "using not only the most depressing food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes the most hideous food prepared."
Many of the depressive cooking methods were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Siegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The couple say that during the writing of the book they understood better the eating habits of their mother, Siegelman, that she could not throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being negligent about food," said Coe.
Siegelman says, "She's seriously poisoned people."
There was one unpleasant case with the profilers.
When the plates at Easynberg's were empty, he and Coe got dessert, which they made at home: a pruning dessert that President FDR had eaten for lunch.
"It's called mousse from pruning," said Siegelman, adding that it was a common use to give modest recipes brocade names.
There was no whipped cream, just pruning, a little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everybody hurriedly put a spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe asked for more twice.
He said to his wife, with the voice of a confident budget maker, "A little ruble of walnuts would be useful here."
The arrest of the figures in the Hovan Cemetery case was extended until 14 November
The Resense Court left the case of a mass fight at the Cemetery of Khovan on 14 November under arrest, granting a request for investigation.
In the case there are 14 accused.
On 14 May, several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus fought with weapons at the Cemetery of Khovan, killing three people.
The former head of the Cemetery, Yuri Chabouev, and a lawyer, co-founder of the public organization Healthy nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, have been charged with arranging the murder.
The second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
On 12 August, the Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation, Olga Hungryec, reported this during a visit to the region of Britannia.
We have specific parameters for how much a pension needs to be raised to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations made.
Now economists are taking stock of the six months, and we're going to finish this work in the next two or three weeks," quotes the Interfax Faminer.
Commenting on Alexei Kudrin's six-month scheme for raising the age of retirement each year, the Vice-Premier reported that the topic was not being considered in Kabmin.
At the end of July, it was reported that the Government had agreed on a policy to fully index pension payments in 2017.
Camenski and Gregorian went to the finals of a small-calibre rifle shooting match.
Russian sportsmen Sergei Camenski and Cyril Gregorian took the finals of a small-calibre rifle shooting at the Brazilian Games.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamenski scored 629 points and ranked first, a new olympics record.
Cyril Gregorian became the second, 628.9 were.
A total of eight of the top sportsmen were in the finals.
Kamenski is the world's record in this discipline (633).
Turkish opponent Fethullah Guillen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d'état in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate an attempted coup d'état," quotes the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also stated that "if any part of the charges proves to be true, I will return to Turkey."
However, Guillermo denied any part of the government, underscoring that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul court had previously arrested in absentia the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Guelen.
Let us recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15-16 July.
Gilead will reimburse for legal services during a patent dispute against Hepatitis C with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to obtain compensation for the costs of the legal services it incurred in connection with a patent claim against a drug against Hepatitis C with the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc, ordered by the Federal District Judge.
In June, Gilead was released from payment of 200 million dollars of damages for breaching two of Merck's patents related to Gilead's drugs, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge discovered a number of abuses by Merck, including a sworn lie and other unethical actions.
On appeal to the court on Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to reimburse the costs incurred during the challenge.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the new generation of drugs against Hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case occurred in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work based on sophosbuyer, an active ingredient of Gilead's drugs.
US-supported armed forces claim to have intercepted complete control of Manridge from the Islamic State
The US-supported armed forces seized complete control of the northern city of Manbridge near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State elements left the city on Friday.
The Syrian democratic forces (SDF) are now cleaning up the city after the remaining group of combatants who have been hiding in the city has left.
They released more than 2,000 civil hostages who were held by the soldiers and informed the Reuters agency of Charfan Darwish of the U.S.S. military council of Manridge.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we're doing cleanup operations," he told Reuters.
It earned $10.75 million in 2015, and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, showing that a democratic party president and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in performance fees, and the former secretary of State announced an income of $3 million from the publisher of Simon & Schuster for her book on her stay in the State Department.
The potential vice president of the United States, Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, has published tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective rate of 20.3 per cent of the federal tax.
"Hillari Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency," said the campaign manager, Wilson Palmeri.
Quite the contrary, Donald Trump hides himself behind false excuses and breaks his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It's common for US presidents to publish their tax returns, though the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited the State tax office as the reason why he refused to publish his tax returns.
"Your turn," wrote a Twitter-based campaign counsellor, Clinton Jan Sams, referring to the declaration of a candidate from a democratic party.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the end of the checks.
Critics of Trump, including a candidate for President from the Republican Party in 2012, and other fellow Republicans, said that his denial raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other links, including with Russia.
The question was taken up by Clinton and she released an online video on Friday, which focused on prominent Republicans who had convinced Trump to publish tax reports.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during a talk about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception for decades: to publish their tax returns," she said to the audience.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump had paid no or no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a business columnist in the New York Times quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who believed that things might still be the case.
The federal tax rate was the subject of a debate in the Presidential elections.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire, an investor named Warren Buffett, that would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30 percent of their tax rate.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omah, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, suggested that Trump meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also under IRS testing, and that Trump is afraid not of tax agencies, but of voters.
The pre-electoral office of the United Kingdom had issued tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chapaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective cumulative tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2012 United States Declaration of the United States of America showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 out of their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons announced a dividend and a capital return of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase protection of Tanzanian elephants
Tanzanian environmentalists use a non-conventional way to prevent elephants from entering localities by throwing chili powder-filled condoms into them.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, along with the U.S. Nature Protection Committee, took over its promotion by training volunteers in northern Tanzanian villages to use a non- violent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Earlier, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday will be World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we've invented a set of tools ... we've seen a change in attitudes within these communities, so they're much more confident that they'll be able to keep elephants out of their fields without hurting elephants," said the Executive Director of Honeyguide, Damian Bell.
The first two steps are to light a torch before an elephant breaks the border and to signal with a horn.
If he couldn't be scared off, they're throwing away the so-called chili cloud.
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with a chuckle in a condom, and its end spins, and there's only a wick outside.
When you're on fire, a cannon bursts with a roar, spraying small dust of chili powder in the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The extreme measure is a launch device that fires Roman candles into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomatic agents have not returned to Turkey, who left the country after an attempted coup d'état last July.
This information was given by the head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevlut Chavushoglu, in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we withdrew 208 human resources agents to continue their work in the centre.
Of these, 32 have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish foreign government.
Let us recall that an attempted coup d'état took place in Turkey in July.
The national authorities had officially declared that the State party had failed and had reported the detention of over 6,000 people, including military officers at the top and middle levels.
According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 290 people died as a result of the coup attempt.
The Jewish director critically criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's "request" phone code to the Arabs, as reported by RT News
A French director of Jewish origin had caused a media scandal, discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli telephone code on its list, and employees referred to "requests" from Arab clients.
Claude Lenzman, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoa", expressed his dissatisfaction at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lentzman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the telephone code list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, had not been mentioned among the States to which you could call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lentzman.
Instead of Kempinski Bristol, it provides an opportunity to hire Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the matter at the hotel administration's desk.
The answer he got there, according to Lanzman, was "shocked him."
The hotel clerk said that this measure was "a thought-out decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel network."
The reason behind this move caused the director's even more anger.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's code be deleted," said Lanzman, a hotel servant.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handellsman, called the case a "horrible shame," reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's really a terrible shame.
That this happened in Germany and in this hotel network is even more shameful.
You don't need an explanation here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply "goes on" with the alleged demands of Arab clients.
"Should be ashamed," said another post where it was said that the hotel, located on the famous Kurfurstendamm Street, was next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastily dropped any charges, calling it an "uninspection" and "apologise" to Lentzman, reports the Der Spiegel newspaper.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the rapid-recruitment list," quoted a representative of the Kempinski Hotel in the Suddeutsche Sietung newspaper.
She adds that the code has now been added.
The police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students.
The students encountered the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest government reform of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse the students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in a demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
As suggested by the state governor of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public high schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some protesters were seen writing on the walls of graffiti against temporary President Michael Temer.
This last protest occurred just a few days after the protesters went on the streets to support President Dilma Rousseph, who had been suspended, when the national senate had voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, reports the RT Business Portal
With the lifting of the sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Jagarian.
Since international sanctions against Iran had been lifted, there was a growing interest on the part of Russian companies in conducting business in the country, said the ambassador.
Russian companies are reconnecting with Iran, and new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Jagarian.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent, compared to the same period in 2015, to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground transportation and weapons,” said the ambassador.
Jagarian also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic office in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly to tourists, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran had entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of visitors to Russia.
It is safe to say that last year's record for the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, a relatively small number of Russians are visiting Iran, which, hopefully, will change.
"I personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yidz, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The State continues to roll up its problems in the defence and industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the Director of the Almas-Antey Company, the “miss of work” and the “loss of trust”.
Genady of Bender has been appointed head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about Necorodov's dismissal only appeared on Thursday evening and did not generate widespread media resonance.
What explain this silence in the context of the massive rearming of the army?
Most probably the Russian government does not want to spread any rumours or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This proves once more that the Defence and Industrial Complex (PPC) has many problems and the State is unwilling to attract increased public attention to them.
The removal of Necorodov is certainly an important development in terms of order in the industry.
The NGO "Almaz" is the main company of a company that specializes in the production of marine and ground-based air defence systems.
Almaz is currently in the process of creating the Polyment-Redute and Morpheus RCA, which are to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia Portal, Dmitry Cornnew, believes that the dismissal of Nescorodov is due to a delay in the projects.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007 and was expected to take place in 2013.
Polyment-Reduth should be the main air defence system on the latest Navy ships.
According to the information I'm getting, in a few years of testing, no real success has been achieved.
The truth is, as far as I can tell, it's not the absolute fault of "Almaz," said Cornnew.
The expert fears that a "C-500" RCA may cause a delay in commissioning.
The pilot design of the project has not yet been completed, but the first complexes are expected to join the military during 2016.
In the Ministry of Defence, it is stated that “work is planned and everything will be completed within the specified time frame”, although in 2014 the department recognized the problems with the development of the C-500.
It is very difficult to evaluate the professional performance of Nescordov, who has been managing Almasm since 2011.
The root observed that project time breaks could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, in recent years it had become extremely difficult to obtain information on internal processes in the PKK and on the plans of the management of companies.
The industry received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large money is known to love silence.
Directors of defence companies usually resign at their own will, under a contract of agreement between the parties, or are transferred to other jobs.
In this case, the removal took place in public, although it was not resonant.
This suggests that the leader of Almasa was perhaps a figure of stoutness and resisted the top-down "disarmament."
It seems that the State is no longer willing to tolerate such behaviour.
It will suspend those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence and fail to carry out their tasks.
At the same time, the management of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the corrupted managers (the star shipmen's flags).
The President himself has placed greater emphasis on the sector.
Vladimir Poetin chairs the Military-Industrial Commission and holds periodic re-arming meetings.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the PKK administrators by seeking to have at hand the members of the directors who will follow orders received from the top.
This is far from an ideal policy, but in the face of corruption and lack of normal competition in the PKK, the State has no other tools.
The current situation in the defence is certainly not a disaster, but the current geo-politic environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the armed forces to order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of managers in the PKK, the Russian leadership is taking very successful steps to improve the professionalization of Russian troops.
The army has acquired a new quality with the assumption of the post of Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted a famous saying, "If you want peace, prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear equality achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki pact, which established Moscow as a sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked well.
The lack of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East proved that.
The cemetery of the “winners” in the cold war has ultimately led to an increase in international terrorism.
After a series of attacks in Europe and the United States, there seems to be no quiet corner left in the civilized world.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
Under such circumstances, the Navy and the army remain the only allies of our country.
The enhancement of military power will enable Moscow to better defend national interests and to take on new frontiers of world politics.
The Scotsman Callum Skinner runs down the finish line, resulting in British grabbing bicycle gold
The Scotsman Callum Skinner rushed to a triumph in a male team sprint on a bicycle in Rio last night, as a result of which the British Command Trio defended its title from London in 2012.
A 23-year-old native of Glasgow was the strongest, which his Scots friend, Sir Chris Hoy, had made his own, and the young man proudly entered history, rushing through the finish line to break the victory of the foreman team from New Zealand.
Britain declared its right to unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy declared his right to the fifth of his six gold gold coins.
And they repeated the trick after finishing with modestly six at the March World Cup in London, despite the fact that Hoy had since completed his career.
The question between Beijing and London was to replace Jamie Stuff's specialist.
They did it just when Hindes appeared.
Joy's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crumpton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was followed by British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scots that was now realized.
Hindes, Kennie, the champions with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set a record record, but the norm was exceeded by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was exactly behind his lap, but Kennie pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed up.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation where Hindes was driving in a larger gear to slow down and let Kennie and especially Skinner keep up the pace.
He watched from his place as an invited BBC expert and caught Skinner, Kennie, and Hindez staring when they entered the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can to make my name myself.
We set a record in the finals and we won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kennie and Hoy, Hindez deliberately fell on the track after a bad start.
He later gave up the comment, and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like London, with all those British flags on the stand."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We've been losing so many world-name races that winning the olympiade again was amazing.
It's one event, one gold coin for a country that won seven of the 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that's the barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the bike will have five more successful days.
With the form shown by Kennie, it's not beyond the ability to imagine how he repeats Hoy's feat by winning three olympics gold coins in the same Games.
This would make it possible to see how Kennie, who is exactly 12 years younger than Joy, who was also born on March 23 (which seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Moe Farah, and Roger Bannister's birthday), brings his account up to six gold coins and one silver coin.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Next time, Kennie competes in a sprint that begins today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Teamwork is always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold coins, he must get knighthood."
It was the only jest of the day, but there was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull are classified as the fastest four-mile team race in pursuit.
They finished at 3:51.943.
The world record for winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will certainly be at the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the classification race, when officials demanded that he measure his weight.
At an appropriate women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsel Shend, Elinor Barker and Cathy Archibald of Milgawi have improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13,260.
The UK team has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take over the middle of the Games and earn a lot of coins.
After in fact exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in the incremental preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the second, not the last, leaving the post of technical director of Shane Sutton in April because of charges of sexism and harassment, and the departure of large figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the basis of the first night's cyclist race, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain in reaching the top at the right time may well recur.
The future of the Portland metallurgy plant is threatened by the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Aluminium Plant in Victoria, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is threatened by the fact that the electric power company that provides the plant, according to one of the factory owners, is about to terminate the contract of delivery: it is planned that all the supply arrangements will be terminated.
This is the result of a decision made earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
A fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be threatened at the Alcoa factory in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, can be at risk as a result of any shutdown.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014 Alcoa shut down a steel factory in Pointe Henry, which led to the shutdown of the Englesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland Steel Plant loses money and risks closing.
These actions were the result of a reflection on the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, due first to the strength of the Australian dollar and later to the price of the factory's products.
AGL, which provides electricity to a large aluminum factory from its Loy Young A power plant in Latbor Valley, said that it expected the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contract.
The plant's controlling share is owned by the joint short-term company Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have a smaller share.
"The AGL company expected the Portland facility to continue operating, i.e. that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant would not stop," she said.
According to AGL, these are the so-called “hedged contract” that was to take effect in November 2016.
The contract has a 12-month period of termination, so it will actually expire in 2017.
"The AGL company, therefore, is still expecting these contracts to generate its share of revenue in FY17," said the electricity company.
Any potential impact on AGL's revenue from the financial year 2018 to date has been limited by forecasts for a strong future market for bulk electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of the contract in its accounts by $187 million in terms of the "future break."
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contract “does not affect Alcoa's ability to manage the metallurgical plant or to supply electricity to the metallurgical plant”.
An American company stated that it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Young in 2010 which was due to take effect in November this year, but had yet to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared that both the Portland metallurgy plant in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle might be shut down due to the economic disadvantage in the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier this week, AGL's Chief of Operations, Stephen Mikkelsen, said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts of energy.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as a manufacturer, it would be bad,' he said.
Not just the star of the Kardashian reality show, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, the model and fourth daughter of the Cardashian-Jenner family of Chris' mother manager, appeared on the wanted September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is a face of the Estee Lauder brand and who defiled it on fashion weeks in May, Paris and New York, reported this news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
"While I was in the room with my favorites, I looked at this cover and cried," wrote Kendall.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the Cardashian family?) prepared by a reality video in which the entire Cardashian-Jenner family (the Rob and Kathleen divers, who also joined the world's favorite show business uncle, the producer of the Cardashian family, Ryan Seacret, forgot the appearance of the sister on the cover, and at the end a classic turning-off: they were planning a surprise party.
It's the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's birthday television show (Sirche says, "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the program at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed to get that fame to other girls one way or the other.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have certainly entered the new age of the Kardashian show.
May Kendall Kim's older sister have been on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on it with her husband, Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September edition is the most traded edition of Vogue in the year.
The volume, which looks more like a gift publication than a fancy magazine, attracts a huge number of advertisers. (Fashionista Portal estimates that 615 pages of last year's 832-page issue contained advertisements.)
News of who the stars are going to get on his cover is expected so eagerly that in the last two years, photos of the magazine have merged to the official advertisement.
Among the previous women on the cover were Naomi Campbell, Linda the Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "models that work" on the cover than "models that are famous."
The winner of the "Oscar" prize and the face of the brand Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honour.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as a "excellent model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, stars of reality shows, or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are really talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in his career in connection with the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, because of her last television reality show star, should always have been sane.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret was critical of Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "the moment's bitches."
These moods re-entered after the news of Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But it doesn't make sense to focus on discontent.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September Vogue.
It's a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She defiles for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you a ton cream from the Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you their photos in their own subscription apps.
She sells personal photos of Crawford's daughter to LOWE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her kids, she's part of a reality TV show.
Public legal centers refuse to service 160,000 people per year
Every year, more than 160,000 least protected people are denied services in public legal institutions, as the sector is prepared for an effect that will further reduce funding on already overexploited activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly older persons, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unjust property abuses, etc. — have already been denied access to free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside the scope are preparing for further cuts.
Since June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
Queensland's Director of Public Law Centers, James Faurell, said that according to the latest survey report of the National Association of Public Law Centers, thousands of people had been denied a year.
Faurell said that if the Federal Government's decision was not revoked, the situation would only worsen.
"Queensland's public legal centers are constantly underfunded: that means thousands of people are denied vital services," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and bankrupt debts, families through divorce, unfairly dismissed workers -- all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands of less protected Queensland people will have to deal with complex legal issues without help.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these cuts so that people can get the necessary help when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government met its obligation to raise the funding of free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public legal institutions and communities, their clients, and it is time for the government to invest in this important work.
At the pre-election office of Donald Trump, he was sued after an officer was allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York City, Donald Trump's election office was brought to court: the head office allegedly did nothing after having reported that his operations director in North Carolina had threatened a staff member with a pistol while they were driving in the jeep in February.
The incident was described in a Wednesday suit filed with the State Court in Charlotte Vincent Boardini, a former software instructor at the state election office.
Boris said he waited a few months for the problem to be solved internally, but he realized "it's not going to happen."
Director Earl Philip "has pulled a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and directed a blow to Vincent's kneecap," so Boris claims in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional office of the pre-election office, Bordini realized that at least four more people had been involved in similar incidents with Philip, and was confirmed in the appeal.
"Pistols don't have to shoot to do damage," said Boris in a complaint.
The suit took place just two days after the Republican party's President's candidate produced a furor, telling North Carolina listeners that the "second-amend people" -- understood as the owner of the weapon and its amateurs -- could act if his rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected and could choose the judges.
Trump's pre-election staff said that the media had pulled his words out of context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In his complaint, Boris sought compensation from the election office for reckless control and from Philip for threats of physical violence, assault and moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks is slow to respond to the request for a comment.
Trying to talk to Philip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip had recently left the election office.
In response to a call from his consulting firm, the innovative consulting services, no one called back quickly.
A Republican candidate, Donald Trump, ran a disputed campaign.

Britain must channel the olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring prosperity and prosperity not only to our communities here and generally across London, but also to the entire country.
I think it was exactly the huge advantage of Heathrow, just as it was in London 2012 where we made every effort to make sure that our people and regions benefit from the Games.
The Games have been of great value to Stratford and the East End.
And we'll do it again, creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our communities here will we create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like London 2012 will be those who think that Heathrow's expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the olympics and that we would find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
Sceptics were wrong in 2012 and will be proved wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about it.
Like the Heathrow Games, it's an infrastructure project for most people, not just for a narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has introduced a programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investments in time and within the budget, from T5, the best-selected airport terminal for five consecutive years, to T2, built in the middle of the world's two most active runways.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Games have been a huge success for Britain, and I am sure that Heathrow's expansion will happen.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow by providing our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can proudly take.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Attaché of the treasury
Adlock Plus, Facebook plays cat-mouse on the blocking of advertisements
For companies that make money on internet advertisements, trying to bypass advertising software is a game of cat-and-mouse, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertisers on its desktop version, Adblock Plus published a blog saying that users could update their filters in the program to block advertisements on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that a desktop version of the site would change the story around its advertisements so that it would become more difficult for advertising blockers to recognize which parts of the page were advertisements.
But Adlock now claims to have managed to bypass the new code.
In a blog published by Adlock Ben Williams, he said that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open source advertising community and those trying to bypass it has continued since the invention of the advertising blocking process and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution shortly.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has joined the struggle is a clear sign of how much of the problem has become industry advertising blockers.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to the last year's Pagefire and Adobe study; almost four times as many people used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users on Facebook using mobile devices, mobile advertisements now account for 84 percent of Facebook sales.
However, the company hunts the desktop advertisement blockers because mobile advertisement blockers are not effective in mobile Facebook applications for social media and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, desktop advertisements are a lucrative enough piece to make Facebook feel that such a step is a lucrative investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to upgrade its "advertising" tool to give people more control over how advertisements are placed on them.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that the new Adlock filters were disturbing, as they would also block some unprofessional content on the site.
"It won't be a positive experience for people, and we're planning to solve this," said Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertisers are a rough tool, so instead we've focused on creating tools like advertising preferences to hand over control to people.
A woman moved on a Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman has moved several cars on the highway early Thursday morning in a clear suicide attempt.
The incident took place on A1 near the Moor in Canton Vaud immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and she was hit by several cars, reported to the police in a statement.
The victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, clearly tried to kill herself and struck several cars, including a truck.
She died right there.
Several involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police have informed them that they and someone else who witnessed the incident are called upon to respond.
A criminal case was brought, a "logical" step in this situation, and counsel Gilles Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve stated.
However, it remains to be determined whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine," said Hoffstetter.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case, both of which involve a man walking in the dark along the highway, the verdict was that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian accidentally on the highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of being killed by carelessness after she had hit and killed a man lying on A1 near Pyern in the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and fainted on the road, heard the trial.
The court found that a female police officer — who responded to an emergency call — was driving a vehicle that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was a "exclusive and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday near the Walrus should call the police for 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once inhabitable
Venus may have once been inhabitable, as estimated by the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the Nassau Institute for Space Research, Goddard, have developed a model for the study of the past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and an atmosphere over-saturated with carbon dioxide, could ever have an environment similar to that of the earth.
Scientists had previously assumed that the low rate of rotation of Venus was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a dilute atmosphere like the Earth and still rotate slowly.
The model also examined the topography of the early Venus.
There were probably more drylands on the planet than on the Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variables to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also enjoyed the sun, which was 30 percent of the party.
"According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus has set up its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months at a time," explained the GISS scholar Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
This warms the planet's surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that functions as an umbrella that protects the planet's surface from a substantial part of solar heat.
The result is average climate temperature, which is surprisingly somewhat colder than it is today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to that previously assumed by planetary researchers.
Despite the fact that Venus may have been inhabitable for a few billion years, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapour was burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen erupted, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- that is, Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model in the journal Geohysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving as coach of the Avalanche team.
Patrick Roy left the position of coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey operation on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
The Executive Vice President/Head of the Colorado team, Joe Sakick, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as chief coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche ice-hockey activities with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer I spent a long and hard time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve that goal, the vision of the coach and the vice president of hockey must perfectly match the vision of the organization.
He must also have the right to vote in making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish it success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award Prize as the best coach of the league during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013 - 2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was shattered by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost the playoffs for the past two years.
The Avalanche team announced an evaluation of 39–39–4 in the 2015–2016 season and was five points behind the Wild team in the struggle for a second graceful trip to the Western Conference.
The gateman from the Hall of Fame, Roy, won four Stanley Cups, two each with Montreal Canadians and the Avalanche.
North Sea oilmen resume talks and suspend strike
Working strikes on oil workers' wages in the North Sea have been suspended, and all the parties to the debate are embarking on a new round of talks, reported by the lead representatives of the parties.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil company were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and United and RMT associations can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve the current dispute," said the joint statement.
We will hold several full-time meetings over the next few weeks, starting next week, to look at the problems with fresh eyes.
Trade Unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in over 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group has this year reduced the rate paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressures.
The company's rate reduction occurred after a 10 per cent reduction in the rate for contract employees working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts would give it the space needed to overcome the market decline.
Shell, for its part, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries with a value of up to 10, as it was rationalizing its operations as a result of its mega-merger interaction with the British power company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower prices for unpurified oil: the economic situation has been worsened by the decision to withdraw from the European Union adopted in June by the United Kingdom.
A Scottish member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, had met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts that had occurred in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, contrasting with the average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measure the rotational speed of the stars in the Pleyad cluster
The last mission of Kepler's Space Telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation speeds of the planets in the Pleyad.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in a cluster rotate at different speeds, and how rotational periods relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Louisa Ribal, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleyad's accumulation is 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak rotational speeds, these growing stars eject large amounts of star wind.
By travelling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds act as a slowing effect on the stars.
As the star grows older, its rotational velocity begins to slow down.
Kepler measure the rotational speed of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognized star spots, such as sun spots.
The newest speed catalogue suggests that larger stars rotate slower than smaller stars.
The fishball compares stars to dancers: larger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the ballet, we see those that rotate slowly, usually more massively, while those that rotate faster usually refer to very light stars," said Ribal.
Since the Pleyad's accumulation is so close, it is the perfect space laboratory to compare star properties with rotational speeds.
"The planetary cluster of the Pleiade provides a starting point for theoretical models of rotation of stars, both younger and older," said Ribal.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why stars slow down their rotation and hunt their "dancing shoes" on a nail, figuratively speaking.
Fishball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the rotation speeds of the Pleiades in three new articles which will soon be published in the astronomical Journal.
The investigation of a group of Ukrainian delinquents in Crimea is carried out by two agencies, writing "Commersant".
The FSB collects evidence of the accused ' s involvement in the preparation of a diversion to Crimea.
As previously reported, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Evgeny Panov, who agreed to work with the investigation, gave a confession.
He said that he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armenia, the oilbase in Feodosia, the Kerchen ferry, the gas pipeline and one of the military airports as diversion facilities.
The law enforcers believe that not all agents of the subversives have been apprehended.
This led, in particular, to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Rice of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Cerchezov became the main coach of the Russian football team.
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cerchezov as the main coach of the Russian football team.
The contract will last for two years, until the end of the MM-2018.
On 11 August, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cerchezov as the main coach of the Russian football team.
This is a famous football player who used to play in Moscow's Spartak as a gatekeeper, as well as a coach with considerable experience, who coached Russian teams like the same Spartakus, Jewel Sochi, Terek, Amcar, Dinamo, and Warsaw's Legias, who became the winner of the national supremacy and the country's cup.
It is reported that the contract with the Churchesov will be signed as soon as possible and will last for two years.
It is therefore incumbent upon him to prepare for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that Miroslav Romanchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikiv will be part of his training staff.
There's information that the entire coach's office's salary will be 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to media data, the Russian government has set Stanislav Cerchezov as the goal of bringing the Russian team to the semi-final and winning the coin.
As the coach himself said, he considered the creation of a competitive team environment to be a top priority and was going to give football players an opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Churchesov, he's glad he's had a choice.
The first match led by the Russian Churches team will take place on August 31 in Antalya, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Remember, Leonid Slutsky had previously been the head coach of the Russian football team, who combined him with the coaching at the CSKA club.
He announced his departure after the Russian national team's failure at Euro-2016 in France.
In doing so, he took responsibility for the bad score of the team.
Embarked between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered a great deal during the long struggle against Apartheid.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990 that country, with a population of 2.4 million, has made tremendous strides, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success was because the Government attached great importance to education.
While people in developed countries perceive free primary and secondary education as self-evident, in many poor countries secondary and even primary schools require a fee.
Moreover, governments are often encouraged to introduce “cost recovery” training fees.
However, in Namibia primary school education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also been free of charge.
The authorities are also active in other important areas.
The efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Despite the international tendency to increase inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to the 1993 figure, the Gini coefficient, the standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this was one of the highest in the world.
And the poverty rate dropped from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also declined, from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country was far ahead of the United States and other rich nations.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Transparency International Perception Index, which is composed of human rights advocates.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt to GDP ratio is about 25%, which is less than 1/3 in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The rate of unemployment, at least in traditional methods of estimation, is still quite high - almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS infection -- almost 17% of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is one of the countries with incomes above average, but the authorities insist that their State is actually a developing country.
Namibia is certainly faced with some of the difficulties inherent in the weakly developed economies.
The State has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
There are isolated nomad tribes of hunter-gatherers living in deserts, who must somehow be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
The integration of people who had been on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: just as any other country in the world faces the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia had not thought to give up; it was addressing the problems it faced.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diverse economy and a united society.
Significantly, competing political groups have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20% of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia talks about building a wall that separates the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that they did not choose their neighbours, so they decided not to conflict with them, but to work together -- share scarce water resources, participate in regional health projects, encourage investment and exchange students.
Moreover, the Namibian Government had rightly reasoned that rich natural resources could easily become a curse, helping to enrich the few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that Namibia's natural wealth must be invested in infrastructure and productive capacities.
They were also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum returns from the country's resource sales, and were revising investment laws and contracts to make sure that that was the case.
Transparency is critical to this process, so the Government's strong support for freedom of expression is so important.
As the Head of State Hage Gaingob pointed out, the media often say things he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from Apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect its acquired freedom, says the President.
Not all Namibia's key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, were resumable, and the Government was making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia showed that even countries that began with serious shortcomings -- racism, colonization, inequality and underdevelopment -- could embark on a common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard of Varna's Gold, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 B.C.E.).
Perhaps it was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, at the digs of the Necropole of Varenski, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found -- over three thousand to a total weight of six kilograms.
Only 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg were extracted from one grave known as "Mobile No. 43".
However, the official status of the world's ancient gold may soon turn to the invisible bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
Again in Bulgaria, a prehistoric settlement known as the Tell Yuncite.
Unlike Varna, a port town, the Tall Yunasite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yuncite, Pazardjik district.
The bushin is a golden strip wrapped in a ring.
Javor Bojadjiev, the dig leader in Talla Yuncite, dated the discovery of 4600 B.C.E. and declared that she was at least 200 years older than Varna's gold.
Barna's treasures, for example, date from about the same period, from 4600 to 4200 B.C.E.
There is currently no technology to date the metal with perfect precision.
How can you be sure what gold is more ancient?
Obviously, Professor Bojadjiev knows more than the Reuters agency said, "I am quite sure that the gold of the Union is older than Varna's gold."
This is an extremely important finding: it looks like a tiny object, but it's large enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Bojadjiev, he said that scientists would soon analyse the composition of the metal and re-search and more thoroughly the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead as precisely as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Yuncite is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
It is now considered the oldest city in Europe.
The Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th century B.C.E.
Over the next centuries, metal processing in the region has grown rapidly, from first metallurgical skills to the creation of a fully fledged industry.
In the national history of this archaeological community, there is a special name: the Balcano Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In the 5th century B.C.E., urban settlements began to emerge around metal processing centers.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yuncite is probably the oldest, since artifacts from 4,900 B.C.E. were found here.
I'd call the Tell Yuncite a modern city, though it's a very ancient village, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is a place older than Schumer for a thousand years," says Bojadjiyev, in view of the generally accepted view that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia, a modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the common sense of the word.
It has been dug since 1976 by Tall Yuncite.
During that time, archaeologists dug up almost 12 acres, which is about a third of the estimated total settlement area.
The rest of the fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, was found.
There's not much left of houses and shops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban dense construction, a business center, and the surrounding areas.
Tell Yuncite is often called "The Bird City," where dozens of earth-shaped birds were found.
All birds were pictured in a state of peace, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects but objects of local worship.
The Bird City was destroyed about 4100 B.C. -- probably by Indo-European tribes coming from the north-east.
Nomads had no towns, but horses and weapons.
The three-metre fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists found obvious signs of a violent carnage: the remains of old men, women and children with wounds caused by axes were found inside the houses.
New discoveries and new facts emerge every year, changing the way we view the ancient history of humanity.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” first civilization of Europe born in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive in the search for this civilization was the “Golden Varna” found relatively recently in 1972.
Logically, Varna's gold luxury had to precede something--something like a tiny golden bead created in the Tellacite.
In Porsche, the 911 Targa model was artificially aged.
It is officially stated that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being trained manually by a specialist unit working with serial machines.
The "Retro-Blue" is, for example, the special color of the Etna Blue bodywork, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B model -- in this color even the logo of the model is painted.
In addition, the Targa received a custom white chart along the board and a special 20-inch RS Spider wheel drive, as well as some parts of the bodywork, painted in "white gold metal".
In the interior of the rectangles, it is markedly smaller: it differs, in large measure, in the sero-blue gamma of design, in new chairs with extended ranges of electrical adjustment and in separate black anodized steel thresholds with the unit logo.
In addition, when a special version is bought, each purchaser will get a car cover and a rich, separate album with photos of the production process.
The Porsche Exclusive power plant did not touch the steel: the retro-targ is quite the same as the serial.
It is fitted with a turbocharged six-cylinder engine of 3.0 litre, producing 420 litre and 500 nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released with a limited printout, but neither the volume nor the cost of each particular sports car will be reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers have launched an arms race.
The recent introduction of Facebook technology to prevent social media advertisements from being hidden has prompted decision-makers to block advertising for reaction.
The AdBlock Plus released an antidote, but Facebook is about to make it useless.
So the AdBlock Plus advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
The social media said that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of unlocked advertising, the decision by the AdBlock Plus, along with commercial advertisements, blocked many regular posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook, they expressed their regret for this AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among social media developers in TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop will be ready within the next few hours.
So social networks and blockers opened up a sort of arms race, trying to beat each other, and the affected party became users who skipped interesting notes from friends or saw advertisements where they were not used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of the blocking of advertisements have recently caused a heated debate.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be tried by the evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated by the Russian Federation Investigative Committee for the Murman region.
The charge against a 54-year-old man is very serious: sexual assault.
The investigation found that at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Pavlov Street in Murmansk had committed sexual acts with violence against a 20-year-old girl. The criminal case with the confirmed conviction was sent for consideration on the merits.
The penalty of this article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring Fengguang 370 and Rich New to Russia, at www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a popular Chinese car class that combines the merit of a minivan with a transponder.
Another announced Russian premiere is Rich New.
Many Western companies of the Moscow International Automobile Salon this year decided to ignore, so the emptiness of the Crocus Expo exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese companies.
In particular, a powerful front will be Dongfeng Motor, which has large Russian market species and is determined in the near future to offer our amateurs a number of interesting innovations.
One of these will be a Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossroads sold in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (slightly less than 550,000 roubles at current rate).
The Russians are unlikely to have such a price, and the issue of transfers to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to reach number 11 on the list of top-selling minivans, although due to the great road light (175 mm) and the protection of plastic over the lower circumferential of the body, it could well be counted as a sneaker.
Crossvan is built on a front-wheel drive platform of the smaller Fengguang 360 model, with a similar wheelbase of 2725 mm in 370, but a slightly longer body (4565 mm against 4510 mm), a larger design, and a richer one.
The salon was decorated with wooden bars, but the large vertical sensor screen shown in the photograph, "like the Tesla's" at the central console, was only on the early expositions of the crossword, and the cars with the "music" were sold easier.
Five of the seven landing places are easily composed, forming a level loading site of 1650 mm long, with a maximum boot volume of 1500 litres.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is only one-and-a-half-litre fuel "atmosphere" engine with a capacity of 115 litre, combined with a 5-step mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer is quietly silent about the dynamic performance of the machine, but promises the owner's budget-saving appetite of 6.7 litres/100 km.
Rich New's pickup is a well-known Nissan NP300 Navara Russians' last generation, but with a somewhat overshadowed Chinese style design.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model still enjoys a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and disliked workhorse.
At a similar price, Rich New will probably interest Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become extremely expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for choice: 2.4 litre fuel (137 litre) or 2.5 litre turbodies (116 litre).
The gearbox is only a mechanic, the drive is for rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigidly connected front.
It will be on the Dongfeng stand and the new A9 flagman sedan, and its Russian premiere was announced by the Chinese firm in June.
Minvene-like crossovers on the Chinese market are growing, one of the latest innovations is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
The current Russian Dongfeng ruler consists of two models: S30 sedan and H30 Cross hatchback.
In the seven months of this year, Chinese dealers made 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notifications will stop sending mail to www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for issuing notices of property taxes.
All Russian motorists have become accustomed to a pattern that has not changed over the years: in summer and fall, they receive mail receipts for the previous year's transport tax.
However, many will not be able to wait this year.
The fact is that the tax inspection has changed the way citizens are notified.
Those who are registered with the Payer's Personal Office on the official website of the agency nlog.ru will be notified online.
The inspectorate automatically considered such Russians to be online users and erased them from the standard, "paper" mail.
The news will affect all owners of transport and real estate.
Everybody else will still get their usual letters.
However, it is possible to revert to the old scheme and to have the account on the site.
In order to do so, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the writing, while the letter will take a few days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet tax inspection service had exceeded 18 million, which would enable the agency to save heavily on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some may have registered in a "personal office" for a one-time service and have forgotten it a long time ago.
These people will not be expected to be notified by mail and will, without knowing it, become non-payers, with all the consequences.
There are three ways in which the "Personal Payer's Personal Office" can be accessed: through the Gosuslugi.ru Portal account, by means of an electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the register card.
The latter may be obtained personally from any branch of the tax inspectorate (whether or not the place of registration).
We recall that transport taxes must be paid by 1 December this year.
The distribution of notifications began in July.
The Mercedes-Benz G-Cool, which aims to achieve very high returns, is something in itself.
But the debatable concept did not confuse G- Power's masters, who had begun to modify the Mercedes-AMG G63 sports version.
G- Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is foreign.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571-strong flying squirrel with tank aerodynamics and uplifting to a hundred in 4.4 seconds?
By pumping the "muscles" of the crazy "helics," the master took advantage of the 5.5-litre supercharged "8."
And the momentum of the upturn to a hundred has improved by the indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "kirpic" is capable of a 5.3 s leap.
However, accelerations from average speeds are probably better for him.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if standard G 63 is faster than 210 km/h, then a fully operated, deactivated electronic collar-carrier can reach 250 km/h.
Outside the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory source, except for other wheel drives, the 23-inch Hurricane RR size 30535 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach suite announced a six-metre-long conceptual coupé, which will be presented as part of the Pebble Beach Elegance Contest.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the green subband BMW i and will advance its electrical models under a separate trade mark.
A minimum of four green innovations are expected in the coming years.
