Are you alone now?
Just let Tom finish his routine.
Why did Tom run away?
Has he been staying here before?
Tom's afraid of Mary's dog.
Do you want a brat?
There's only one week left to go to Holland.

Again, what's my password?
It's a nice coat.
You're so rude.
Let Tom in.

When did you come home?
It'll be hot tomorrow.

You're too skinny.
Come here.

I came to see you.
What's your favorite pizza stuff?
The last point of view has many followers in Japan.
Don't you think you could do that?
I don't know what I can do for you.
Tom's smart.
He's irritating.
If you go, I'll miss you.
Point to the smart one for a mistake, and he'll thank you, point to the stupid one and he'll hurt you.
That's a wonderful idea.
I don't think there's anything there.
Make your point clear.
They don't know us.
Tom probably forgot to tell Mary about it.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
I'll invite Tom to dinner.
Maybe I'll do it again.
Do you really think I'd do that?
It's a lie.
The war took their happiness away.
I wish I had enough money to buy a car.

It's an orange.
He's an atheist.
What does your aunt do?
I was playing with the champion.

In truth, I disagree with you.

When are you leaving?
I have a lot of friends.
I wish I could stay here forever.
After dinner, she always has time.
The earth occupies a smaller part of the earth's surface.
I have a twin.
We begged Tom not to go there.
I think we might have been too aggressive.
You're big.
I have some free time.
I'll help you tomorrow.
This story has entertained me.
Watch your head!
I'll miss you.
Take this.
Tom asked you to do something?
Tom's dog's name is Cookie.
I just changed the password.
I didn't do anything like that.

She teaches us French.
He wasn't at the meeting.

Tom is deeply puzzled.
Is anybody here?
Don't call me.
It's better to die standing up than to live on your knees.
Tom's waiting.
Everybody likes Tom.
I knew you'd wait for us.
I can't forget her.
They've chosen a new government.
Please wait five minutes.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Bring me a clean plate and get the dirty stuff.
Tom told me he was on his own.
Here's the church we got married to.
I don't think Tom's going to be here.
I think it makes sense.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.
He was popular among the voters.
Tom didn't give up the French bill.

What are you doing with that?
She's hard on him.
You're such an idiot!
Dad bought me a book.

Here you go!
Tom says he can't win.
I'm not doing this.
Tom didn't seem offended.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Do you want me to bring you a glass of water?
Tom told me he thought Mary ugly.

Tell us something.
I'm glad you're doing this.
Since I did not get the answer, I wrote to her again.
What would you like to say about this?
Do you think it's a trap?
People, stop killing each other.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were going to do it.
I borrowed a car from Tom.

Why am I so tired?
Wait till the end of my exams.
How many kids do you have?
I'm not done with Tom yet.

I'm sometimes very careless.
I know you don't trust us.
I didn't kill anybody.
I don't think Tom's going to be in Australia next week.
Tom had to wait.
You ate.

I'm afraid I won't finish the report on time.
It's unlikely I'll be there tonight.
I don't trust you.
It travels the world.
The boys are fine.
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she should do it.

Do we have a choice?
No reason.
Let me see.
Tom began to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He runs to the station every morning.
They're running out of food.
Not here.
No one was satisfied.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I was trying to sleep.
Tom's always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just sent me a text message.
So somewhere in this building.
Tomorrow we're open.
I didn't expect such a turn of events.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There's got to be some logic.
Did you work yesterday?
How did you convince Tom to help us paint the clouds?
Have you been to Washington, D.C., U.S. capital?

Listen to what I have to say.
He'll be here soon.
Can't you lift me up?
I'm not pregnant.
He didn't crash.
I have a question.
There's not enough!
Tom said Mary was probably still doing it.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The boss let me go early today.
What time is the end of the world?
I'm never worried.
How sweet!
When I'm in a bad humour, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
It'll be quite cold tonight.
I'm not asking Tom for help.
How much you paid to do that.
You don't have to stay.
One day we'll meet again.

I know you're here.
It's half a third now.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
There is no great hope.
It's not mine.
What exactly do you want, Tom?
We're almost done.
So you have to be home by 2:30.
Are you going to school on foot?
Is that Tom's girl?
Tom's just wasting his time.
Molecule is composed of atoms.
We realize that.
It's not a good time now.
Do you have time to have dinner with me?
Sorry he didn't come to the meeting.
Where do you live now?
You know, he's recently been through a difficult period.
Tom married a neighbor.
My head hurts.
Repeat again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.

Nice weather, isn't it?
Come if you can.
I hate it!

Tom is too old for you.

Are you ready to hear the bad news?
I talked to them.
Has Lucie called yet?
Sounds like Tom.
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I was just about to wash up.
Fun!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do that?
Mary wants me on her team.
No one else listens.
You're brave.
You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit him there.
Put it down.
Tom came last.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Mary ate alone.
You'll really find them, won't you?
I can't stand the moisture.

Tom proved he had Liverpool in his heart.
I licked a spoon.
I kissed Tom yesterday.
Why did Tom kill Mary?
Tom said it didn't happen.
Let's stop this wasteful discussion.
Tom cleaned the apple.
Tom didn't read the report you wrote.
Have you talked to Tom about this?
No one would have helped me do that.
You're Italian.
What's she like?
A pocket thief pulled a passport out of Mark.
I think you like him.
This magazine costs only two pounds, including delivery.
I'll miss you.
I sat down at the shop next to Tom.
They love each other.
Come back tomorrow.
What kind of insects did you eat?
I saw Tom get hit by a car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do that.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees it.
I got on the wrong bus.
I gave up this offer.
Mary had already done what she had to do.
I was watching Tom.
Have you reserved a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandpa was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off the cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
As for going to a picnic.
We couldn't buy our concert tickets until we got the money from our friends.
Tom was calling Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.
Tom doesn't play very well in tennis.
I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
That's why you're here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in a village cannot get the satisfaction of living in a village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a Christmas book.
I want a cheeseburger, a cole and fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new house!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly accepted.
I think Tom's wrong.
Are you all right?
Maybe you're the only one who can do this.
Who doesn't have a radio?
Your singing makes professional singers blush from shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom's down.
It was big.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary.
Hester is a Jewish lesbian.
Last week a dog ate me.
Do you want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try splashing!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's dinnertime.
It's unlikely that Tom will forget how it's done.
Drinking?
Will Tom do it with you?
Aren't you asleep?
The meeting began at 5 p.m.
Mary said she liked to do it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I've only been to Tokyo once.
I got the electricity bill.
What color is his steward?
Last week I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom was planning on doing this.
All members are required to be present.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning on doing this with?
We are satisfied with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.
He was standing in the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sin.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
He'll find out.
A witness who had seen everything in his own eyes was worth more than ten witnesses who had heard it all.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
It's over with Tom.
When I walked into the room, she was playing the piano.
You're very cute.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom plucked his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you where the party is?
Mary's tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
It filled this bowl with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll eat it.
I don't want to anymore.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I guess Tom won't be here today.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep going.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She began playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
Europe has no pyramid.
It's spring soon.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning on staying for a long time?
When do you plan to go to Japan?
My kids are in school.
I put my suitcase in.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you want to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking about you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant eagle.
Sit salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom is younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom is very open.
I'm hungry because I haven't had dinner.
I'm not blaming anyone.
The plane flew at exactly nine.
Tom speaks French quite freely.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll personally check it out.
Tom's got his towel wiped out.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I've got a lot of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait for the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
Next month Tom leaves Boston.
Careful, it's hotter.
Let's kiss.
Every year millions of people die of hunger.
I was wondering what Tom wanted.
The email contained an incorrect address.
This is the last train.
Who will fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
Everybody's in chocolate.
They moved on to another religion.
I have to be careful.
I downloaded them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We managed to save them.
He's a strange person.
I just had a haircut.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
It's our fault.
You're so cute.
It'll cost about fifteen dollars.
I blew the door.
His theory deserves attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis girl.
So Tom became famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You sang.
I did it perfectly.
I like to write.
Kioto is a uniquely beautiful city.
Next month I'm sixteen.
Do you think there's a chance that this is going to happen?
Deal with your dreams.
What time will your last lesson end?
I came to say good-bye, Tom.
I like that dog.
I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing it.
We have to help Tom.
It rained all day.
I'm upset about it.
Can I have your phone number?
You have to stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do that?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes away.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines in the day, and the moon in the night.
I got up on it.
You were right before.
I hope Tom will help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I have a problem with my boss.
It's a banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.
Mary is your girl?
London poured the fog.
I'm so glad you're here, Tom.
Tom's weak.
I told him to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you'll win.
She went to the airport to walk him out.
Step aside.
He's in the kitchen.
Please don't be mad.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
The capital of Brazil is Brazil.
What I really want is to sleep.
I still have to pay the phone bill.
Tom knows how to cook.
And the music makes him nervous.
What languages are spoken in America?
You deserve to rest.
These are fresh.
Tom's eyes are huge.
The rainbow has seven colors.
I think that's why we shouldn't do this.
He's gloomy today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his open mind.
Aren't you on your turn tonight?
Tom never had to learn much.
How's it going with your wife, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has many friends.
That would be unfair.
You have to go there either you or Jane.
If I were you, I'd ignore that.
Tom will just be here right now.
These are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
Do you think I'm joking?
Today I was very tired.
I'm true.
Happiness is not to possess many things.
The news spread all over Japan.
Tom showed the side of the mountain.
The taxi's here.
I heard him come down the stairs.
That's mine.
How strange!
Do you know how to read Cyrillic?
I know Tom pretty well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom's clean, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such an idiot.
Tom gave you something for me?
I would never have been able to do that without your help.
I always have coffee and tea for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I haven't breakfasted.
I'm the best.
How was your exam?
Can I pay you later?
Did this just happen?
Mary didn't take the umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
The truth is, I've been lying.
I'm going to bed!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did it.
They're all tourists.
Can you lend me a pinchet?
It's your life.
Tom said he wanted to drink.
I wondered if Tom had ever asked Mary why she hadn't done it.
Patrick doesn't know how to write.
I was too ashamed.
I'm getting deeper into the details.
Tom said he didn't want to do it.
Let's go to the ocean.
Do you know what the cause of the problem is?
Where is Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry, she doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
I have a good appetite today.
We're quiet in our new house.
There are only two infinite things in the world, the universe and human foolishness, and I can't be sure about the first.
She said, "I'm very happy."
It's interesting to talk to Tom.
What you sow, that's what you'll reap.
What are you looking at?
Couldn't we go faster?
We're not just football players.
All the meat is corrupted.
I was born that way.
Tom and I were racing.
He came home late in the evening.
The UK National Health Service has now updated its recommendations for a coronavirus.
Grab a rope.
Tom and I drink the same thing.
He could not resist the desire to smoke another cigarette.
There's a secret passage.
I don't want to argue with you.
Let me in.
She's unconscious.
I thought Tom would refuse to do that.
I love you.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom was a little confused.
He signed the check.
Hi, how are you?
Password is "Muiriel".
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads novels.
Take the trash out.
You're my friend.
He's got two cars.
They realized.
No problem!
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
May I borrow your knives?
Thank her for her help.
Tom confirmed that no one was injured.
The house slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
They went to the zoo.
I was shy.
They're not enough.
Take my hand, we'll both build a utopia.
Tom said Mary was confused.
One of them is lying.
Harvard was founded in 1636.
Do you really want to go to Boston alone?
It's hot today.
God gave, God took.
How far is Boston from here?
I laughed at his joke.
My father may be asleep.
What's the best way to learn French?
I'm a bureaucratic.
I was born on October 10, 1972.
I was able to solve the problem.
I'm sure he can afford it.
Do you drink liquor?
The parents will fight again.
I like checkups.
Mary's a blonde.
It's in my pocket.
She speaks English well.
Tom's just fooling around.
We have a great team.
My name was at the top of the list.
I doubt what she said.
Tom has a piano.
What do you do about it?
I meet her requirements.
Forget about this sad event.
Please take this away.
Nobody likes to lose.
I think that's why it'll be nice.
I go to the library at least once a week.
I want some coffee.
How did you learn French?
We already know you did it.
The weeds are shattered.
Tom bakes cookies on Sundays.
Did you ask Tom?
Thank God, everybody was fine.
We're the perfect couple.
The fadl is talking too much.
That's what you really need to do.
Tom's still in Boston.
Do you believe what Tom said?
I quit drinking beer.
Tom says I'm a knot.
I did it too.
What are you going to do tomorrow?
This is my wife Edith.
This student is an American.
The cloud of gray.
No one's seen us.
I'll wait here.
As a young woman, she lived in the outskirts of Tokyo.
Does any of this matter?
That's my email.
Tom will do it if you pay him for it.
Baby's asleep.
It's Valentine's Day.
It's not clear what I should do.
Tom knows the journal.
Tell me the truth, please.
We ordered too much food.
I'm not a student.
I'm late for school.
I couldn't solve the problem.
We don't have time.
Just pretend I'm a stranger.
She's much better.
Do you know any other decisions?
In other words, it's lazy.
I took the opportunity to visit the museum.
Tom and Mary are avoiding John.
My memory isn't the same anymore.
Tom loves Mary very much.
Tom's cooking dinner.
The dog himself is smart.
I can't get pictures from the camera!
I was astonished to hear what I had won.
I wonder if Tom told Mary she should do it.
All dogs are animals, but that doesn't mean all animals are dogs.
Those who can come up with only one way to write a word seem to lack imagination.
I'm sure it's a success.
Tom didn't do it.
Where's the nearest metro station?
Tom ran through the window.
Don't you hide anything?
How are you?
I didn't know it was going to happen.
I have a lot of friends.
You can just do it now.
No speed limit.
Tom's a little red.
That's what you have to do.
I probably need to spend some time with Tom.
Do you know how to drive a car?
How did you know this would happen?
I forgot his name.
What's your favorite number?
The school looks like a prison.
It's too difficult.
What exactly did you see?
I just need a minute.
It's her car.
The patient is lying in bed.
Tom's gone.
I have a three-year contract.
The taxi's here.
Dan was attacked by two unknowns.
I don't want to park too close to Tom's car.

His to his own.
It's so good you're back.
You need to sit down with Tom.
I thought it was a good idea.
I just had dinner.
I won't see them.
Aren't you a bachelor?
It's part of the system.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
This spoon is for soup.
Come with me to Boston.
Tell me what you want for Christmas.
Throw Tom the ball.
Don't touch that button!
In English, the verb precedes the plugin.
Tom's a little nervous.
I'm twice as big as Tom.
Your parents loved us.
Tom's still asleep?
Let them help you.
It's nice to live so close to the station.
Have you ever sang French?
Go slowly.
Did Tom bring someone to the party?
It's Christmas.
It's an egg-painted ornament.
You said it was important.
Can you help me?
Tom said he expected Mary to win.
I think they're students.
I just want to say that you did your job well.
I think you've said enough.
I'm a client.
I'm very greedy.
You're crazy.
Tom won't worry Mary anymore.
Answer right now.
I had a suspicion that Tom was missing the house.
Tom hasn't done this since last year.
Have you finished complaining?
Aren't you Mary's husband?
Do they speak English?
No one's seen Tom.
The police continued their investigation.
I think I know what Tom would do.
Tom said he was very busy.
What will you do today?
I love this game.
How's Emily?
We don't care.
We do what we have to do.
You're sick, you need to rest.
I wasn't going to sing that song, but Tom would ask me, so I sang it.
Your pen is better than mine.
I'm not often Mexican food for them.
Try again!

Tom is not an idiot.
It was very cold.
We need to talk.
Tom's asleep.
I wish I was as young as you.
In this store, hamburgers taste better than in that.
Where's Tom now?
He can swim fast.
I need that information as soon as possible.
I'll find a job.
The rain is wonderful.
I had to hide myself.
Tell her to leave me alone.
They've all come.
Are you really too busy?
Kill her.
Tom wanted to be good.
A whale for a swoop and a mouse for a dance.
By the way, the soup was too salted.
Where are you going on vacation?
People love spring.
Tom grew up in a Petra cup.
It's not what you graduated, it's what you learned.
Have you been to school today?
I'm studying English.
It's not Tom's fault.
I don't repent of what I did.
I think you should go there with Tom.
He saw her and began to blush.
Don't you want to be known?
I'm not going to disappear.
I almost won.
I nodded my head.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
Tom wanted to come with us to Boston.
Have any of you been to Hawaii?
Have you eaten yet?

Do you think they'll find Tom?
Give him a microphone.
He could have done it.
Some people believe that Japan's number one is everything.

We thought he was American.
Give me a cigarette.
You're just a guy.
It's got big tits.
We're cool.
Do not turn off the light.
I'm not a millionaire.
He refused to tell me what had happened.
Most people think so.
Oh, it's like milking a cow...
Why do you think Tom couldn't do that?
She was a chorus.
Nobody knows.
They do it as often as they can.

Did you say that because you were robbed?

When did it start?
I like fries.
He's almost always in the hospital.
I just moved in.
Who are you, and what are you doing here?
Thank you for yesterday.

I don't even have a job.
Why would you use this?
Tom lost his husband a few months ago.
I'm a little tired.

Wouldn't you rather do it with Tom?
Who was running?
I hate my neighbors.
Who can explain that to me?

Can we come too?
You're doctors.
How do you like this town?
I like your coffee.
Tom woke up.
How much in one night?
I'm twice your age.
Mary is like my own daughter.
It wasn't Tom, it was Mary.
This is justified.
You're too nervous.
Have you ever seen this logo before?
About the same time Tom was in his room and was studying.
Tom said he didn't think Mary really liked to do it herself.
I know it's easy for you.
Stick this sticker to your suitcase.
I thought you said you were the only kid in the family.

I shouted.
This box is a little tricky.
They're from Sweden.
They sent me to save you.
Tom understands.
Tom's used to it.
Tom's been working all night.
She's not always happy.
I'm sure Tom will do whatever Mary asks him to do.
They're good.

I'm not the same as any other mother's.
I underestimated the strength of the adversary.
Which floor are we on?

Let's talk about what Tom did first.
We'll wait here.
I know Tom will tell you the truth.
I'm sure that's why it'll be nice.
Are you for or against aborting?
It's working.
Let's try it with Tom.

Don't underestimate yourself, Tom.

I have something to say.
A hotel can take 300 people.
I baked so much pie.
It can ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had allied.
Tom has two girlfriends.
What's Tom doing in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary would want to do it.
Tom and Mary said they weren't sick.
I've got a lot of time.
One more thing, please.
I'm a member of the team.
I had a stroke last year.
Mom's busy cooking dinner.
Horses are useful animals.
Come back soon.
He's incompetent.
Thomas was training.
He's unbearable.
He's sure he's making an exam.
Tom was voting for the offer.
Tom told you how long it took him to do it?
Let's get started!
Attention!
I'm completely exhausted.
The prospects are not too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm fascinated by the devil's literature.
The problem is she doesn't have enough experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their child John.
I wonder if Tom is actually going to Mary's concert.
Tom said, did he spend the past weekend with this?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us how to sing.
Let's not do anything.
Tom wants his father buried next to his mother.
Do you think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm a DJ.
I hate Christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It costs too much.
A child was lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to restrain yourself.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Speak.
The surface of the balloon is a non-euclidic space, so it is not subject to the rules of euclide geometry.
The talks were successful.
I apologize for that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I never killed anybody.
Be honest and honest.
There is always hope.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice my age.
The journalist was kidnapped by the terrorists.
I missed the ball.
I hate this town.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
Programming languages are his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many watches do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
So you don't like to eat fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is very proud of you.
Your doctor says you'll be fine.
You panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need that money.
My squirrel is orange.
Tom's still crying?
So I'd like to be higher.
I have to help my mom.
His book inspired me.
Are you brothers?
These aren't my ideas.
You have a plan, right?
He's playing.
Tom's not in town.
My shoes were worn.
Next year will be worse.
Mary's in the yellow dress.
Love has a bitter smile.
The meeting was over.
You should have done it last year.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I've got an old car.
We understand why.
I eat every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
Let's take the elevator.
Tom's a professional jockey.
We went into the woods looking for insects.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small coffee woman costs two euros.
Mother's love is greater than anything.
He was persecuting a thief.
I worked at a restaurant.
I'm not determined enough.
Doing this won't be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put the salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat now.
The glass of the mirror was scattered over the floor.
You're so queer.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She skipped school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom doesn't think I should do that.
State debt is rising.
Why am I me and not you?
Tom will probably never do that.
That doll.
Get out of here!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I've read this story in a book.
Tom still has a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anybody who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends a lot of time online.
You're wonderful.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's go meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't help it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom goes in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We can talk.
The computer can count very quickly.
You're not needed.
Excuse me, may I open the window?
What's the weather?
I'm thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Do you want some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for dinner today?
You can't even change a diaper.
Do people still use webcams?
I wondered if Tom had ever asked Mary why she had dropped out of school.
This word is borrowed from Greek.
Shall I die?
I'm dying so I want to see them.
My brother is sick.
Don't push.
The car is outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost the money.
No rules.
Layla became very soon pregnant.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make a salad out of raw fish?
Tom knew Mary.
Tom's cooking breakfast.
No doubt it will rain.
Tom did not mention Australia.
Obviously, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We were actually going to Boston.
There are many volcanoes in Iceland.
John is two years older than me.
Better or worse, TV has changed the world.
I'm a little thick.
He answered my question easily.
What's the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He must be innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When does she come?
That's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm very glad I did it yesterday.
Tom still lives next to you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I speak.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you meet him often?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You'll stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, excuse me.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in the 2000s.
Tom will probably take care of it.
It must be the right color.
Tom has a very strict mom.
After a short peace, war broke out again.
It's best not to trust Tom.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What's the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you hand me the sugar?
Where exactly does Tom plan to build his house?
"Where's my laptop?" -- "On the chair."
I don't think there'll be any problems.
Tom's broken?
You need to have a haircut.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary plays soccer.
How does this work?
You're very ugly.
Hurry up, boys.
I'll fix my shirt.
When is his return expected?
I've had a good rest.
He's no less good than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I'm making too many mistakes.
He's not afraid of death.
It would be nice if we had 28 hours, wouldn't it?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He would have liked this catastrophe not to happen.
We don't expect to win.
I don't have any money.
I'm not teaching here anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Take the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
Tom will soon learn to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They're good at catching fish.
Tom came out of the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom teaches French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could do it.
I don't have books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is boring.
He's, as it were, a robot man.
Answer the question!
You're needed in the hospital.
I can't find the suspenders.
It's a fake.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do it.
He has green eyes.
Yours was the best.
Tom is often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom has never been to Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, and it was broadcast by the Grand Drive.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
English is not my native language.
I had no friends in Australia.
Do you think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So we shouldn't do it again.
They've been living here for ten years.
Tom stared at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the kids while she's gone.
I'm cooking now.
Have you seen Tom's passport?
Do you want to dance?
He's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom blew his head off?
Why would Tom do that?
I know that girl's father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom won't be able to come with us.
I've got thirty points.
If I don't, Tom will be angry.
Aren't you a therapist?
Don't you write that down?
The big tree fell on the road and, when I drove, blocked my way.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have many friends.
Do you believe in the existence of a god?
I live in Boston.
Tom's blind since birth.
He didn't answer my question.
Does anybody know him?
Aren't you starting to get bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I'm not working for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I was trying to do that.
I wrote a book.
Silence, please.
I bought my son's new sleigh.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister, Sakiko, who was born the same year as I, and now she's getting ready for exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you completed your homework?
Monday will probably be a busy afternoon.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Perhaps you should help Tom paint the fence.
Why do people behave like big monkeys, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Asshole.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go see a doctor.
I've submitted the papers to the visa.
It's snowing today.
She kept working.
The moor broke when we went down the mountain.
Tom's driving.
If you ate less hamburgers, you'd probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go personally.
Please show me how this is done.
Aren't you dating anybody?
All shops are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What's the date today?
Where's Dad?
Lock the door.
I'm not talking to Tom French.
The apple doesn't fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
The uncle is the brother of your father or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She has red eyes.
They won't come back.
I was wearing jeans.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
That's my grandmother.
It's a whale.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do this to you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Do you mind?
I haven't seen you in all eternity.
You're obviously right.
Whose books?
That's what you want to do, right?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks dogs twice a day.
Let me see Tom's book.
The main islands of Japan are Hoccaido, Sikoku, Honsu and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't do it.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I can't help you.
It's broken.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare to him in a tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you realize that?
She committed suicide.
We've put in our office computers.
We have to pay in advance.
Are you sure?
Do you think Tom's going to die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it immediately.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You've missed a lot.
I wear shoes.
You can count on me.
His book has become a subject of criticism.
It'll be brilliant.
I'm so scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm in trouble.
You haven't lost any time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom was witnessing in Mary's case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask your name?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You have to quit smoking.
I think Tom is betraying.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play violin?
Give me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks well French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
He was popular both among the students and among the teachers.
Tears can't help grief.
Tom plays soccer and runs a race.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom couldn't speak French?
He always sings when he showers.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we?
Then Tom hung the listener.
I'll be right back.
The church is at the bottom of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do it.
Tom is calling you.
You have to tell him to do it.
He speaks esperanto with a small French accent.
It's not yours.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't get around that.
She's got fine manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady's assistant.
I'll deal with it.
Have you found any errors?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a wizard?
Am I beautiful?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Fuck off.
Will you let Tom take care of you?
You're a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Tom really moved to Boston?
Tom stretched out Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you come back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
The media are deliberately following the rules of their language without even knowing them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters pointed their rifles at the elephant.
Nobody's wavering.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom's wife is Canadian.
Are you allergic to anything?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do it.
I'd like to borrow the money.
I shake Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half these apples are rotten.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You don't have to worry about tomorrow's exam.
Tom was voting?
I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do it.
Tom began to sew.
Instead of going to school, he remained at home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You can't escape.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you spend your vacations?
This year you got a Christmas present from Tom?
I'm still a little bored with the house and so many things seem strange to me.
I have some memory problems.
Where's mom?
He regained consciousness three hours after the crash.
Do you speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know why?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little behind schedule.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a cab here?
Hurry, you'll be late.
It'll be difficult.
Tom always behaves like that?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to speak so loudly.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait a minute, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It'll work, you'll see.
She gave it up.
Tom's safe.
I finally got my driver's license.
I'm not a student.
So it was Mary's pity.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom keeps checking his phone.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom is not rich, Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everybody was late except me.
Stop it!
It's a book.
I'm not planning to rock a boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom has a lot of strange ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with a client.
I'm disappointed in your efficiency.
Haven't you ever had a car before?
Have you been to work?
What are you learning?
I wish I had eaten those oysters.
Hello.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom goes to the party tonight.
I was talking.
She was on her way to the airport.
She studies Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this would happen?
What is it?
If natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everybody wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's going to Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said what exactly happened?
I finally realized I'm not in love with you.
Did you say that because I was joking?
So it was awfully boring.
Tom said I was beautiful.
I'll be at the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take the trash out.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston card?
Your sister is as wonderful as ever.
It's going to be very hard to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How awful!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him to work, you need to consider his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
It's his obsession idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly left the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a Sin-Doctor.
I know it won't be possible.
Do you have something from the headache?
Children imitate friends rather than parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with friends outside.
Whatever happens, stay calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary got to the bus stop, the last bus was gone.
Tom's wearing a black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We used to speak French.
Bananas taste good.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're worthless.
Have you tried talking to them?
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
Her friends ridiculed her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I doubt Tom can win.
The aliens are coming and taking our jobs from us.
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
Are you going to take the train?
Tom said Mary was great.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, right?
Is that why Boston still likes it?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad and never came back.
Collect your toys together.
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm feeling better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your work yet?
Three years ago I was very rich.
It's not hard to do.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I never lived in Boston.
It matters to me.
This box was difficult.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't.
You've missed something.
I called Tom right away.
You looked interested.
It'll help.
I'll be sorry.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to achieve his goal.
Ken has two cats.
I realized what my mistake was.
I like trips.
The phone doesn't work.
That's what we want.
Tom's in sunscreens.
Tom is a good painter.
All you have to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can you rent a costume for Halloween?
Tom's busy and he can't help you right now.
We're not a couple.
A student wants to see you.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm starting to get hot.
Why aren't you asleep?
Tom really thinks someone's listening?
You don't need a break!
Tom, you might say, is nice.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I should have gone before.
I met him accidentally.
Why do you like it?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a hunch.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tom's wife asked him to quit his job.
Could you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This table is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I was playing baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a ticket for free.
You are such an unbearable man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you spoke French.
I did my best.
No, sir, she's free.
I'm very interested in studying French.
Be nice to the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't believe anybody.
I'm glad you're satisfied with your job.
Do you work around here?
You admit it, don't you?
I've got things to do tomorrow.
I'm not clean.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but I grew up in Stockholm.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding.
I share everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom talks about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely settled.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I don't sleep well.
Wouldn't you buy that?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if Tom had done it?
You did it?
I'm having trouble sleeping.
Tom sometimes irritates me.
I'm a pretty good dancer.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obviously cheaper for you to spend the night with us.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
I never said no.
Rio already has a subway.
Are you ready to help us?
Tom is a rare villain.
His hair was getting thinner and thinner.
Yesterday my sister went to Kobe.
Don't you speak from the perspective of experience?
He likes ice cream.
I was hungry.
What do you need to know?
She has twice as many CDs as I do.
The street is empty again.
Tom couldn't catch the rabbit.
All dogs are faithful.
I think Tom hates me.
We're so excited.
Tom and Mary are both very upset.
Aren't you staying with us?
It's Communism.
In this place the river suddenly shrinks.
Jesus is a parasite.
I don't often do that.
Tom is a very practical person.
I have a good mother-in-law.
I want a political shelter.
It was quiet after the storm.
There is no easy way to succeed.
Here comes the train.
He likes tigers.
It rains, so we can't do it.
It was extremely surreal.
These students are Koreans.
Get out of here!
What's your nickname?
Tom and Mary plan to retire when they're sixty-five.
Can I use your phone?
Your suffering pleases me.
When did you do anything for me?
We locked the door.
There he is!
We're different.

I heard you kissed Tom.
Let's go!
Maybe I made a mistake.

Do you understand French?
I bought it that week.
Obviously Tom isn't talking to Mary.
I have to go tomorrow morning.

You don't have to hurry.
What's the boy's name?
I always get up about half by eight.
Did I ask you to?
That's what Tom finally did.

Are you French or English?
He turned over the horn.
Just keep doing what you do.
You made three mistakes.
There is no rule, but there are some exceptions.

Tell 'em I'm exhausted.
I thought Tom wouldn't do it.
How much money do you want?
Tom changed.
I don't enjoy traveling in large groups.
Tom doesn't regret anything.
I'm sorry, please.
What's in your backpack?
This time we have evidence.

Just listen to us.
Good luck.
I'm the best.
I was astonished at how Tom did it.
Tom speaks French too.
Aren't you ready to help us?

Without effort, nothing can be achieved.
Do you want to know how?
Do you like Chinese food?
That's why Tom went to Boston.
He retired at age 65.
I lost my pen.
I'll keep working.
I was at the meeting yesterday.
Layla's late.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she did it.
I'll be in Boston for a few days.
I've already done it.

Everybody wants something.

Tom helped me wash my car.
This is our first Christmas here in Australia.
I'm taking care of my grandpa.
I'm going to drive around ten in the morning.
Did you come with the train?
You're not as young as Tom.
He's slowly recovered from the disease.
In Rome, do as Romans.
He saw an expression of surprise on my face.
Hurry up and you'll get the train.
It could be cancer.
I wonder if Tom would actually do it.
I don't like ice cream.
I don't want to sell a car.
I just want to measure it.
Tom's car was confiscated.
Could you open the window?
I wonder if Tom's scared.
How well do you know Tom?
You can go.
I have Tom's keys.
Let us in.
I'd like more butter.
Obviously, Tom likes it here in Boston.
Tom turned off the music.
The boy I love doesn't love me.
You're very busy.

I signed the check.
She gave me a shirt.
Mary trusts me.

Where did you work last year?
Your secret will be safe with me.
Tom would be very proud of you.
He came personally.
I'm really hungry.
Tom died in the same year as Mary.
We went to the street.
I think that studies spoil education.
It's very cold.
That's why you came back from Boston, right?
Tom believed it?
Actually, he's never been to New York.
Tom thought Mary and John might be involved in arms-smuggling.
I was sober then.
Here's your yield.
Tom was waiting for Mary.
It was founded in 1565.
I'll go to Boston with Tom.
I don't think you can do that.
First, you have to understand yourself.
I was there yesterday.
I'll wait here till he comes.
Tom can drive.
I read novels on purpose.
I was going to tell Tom, but I forgot.
I'm a hero.
They love us.
I really need your help.
Tom betrayed you.
I got up about six.
I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty smart.
Does it matter?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Tom may not even be on the team.
I ask myself if I can trust him.
What happened to her?
Are you drinking?
I got angry.
When did he arrive?
Where's your teddy bear?
How are you, Tom?
Maybe this year we'll finally win in Europe.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I was able to forget my wallet.
Cats catch mice.
You can go.
Tom said he wouldn't mind doing it for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do it.
From what wonder would Tom like to do that?
Birds can see the earth's magnetic field using their eyes.
Do you need a car?
This is Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in!
Are you planning on doing this somehow?
Am I clear?
I'm free today.
Tom will probably be punished for doing this.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
There's no need to hurry.
Are you satisfied?
At first I didn't believe him.
The phone isn't working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Come inside.
Tom can be fined if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really stupid.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary he saw John in January.
You always get up early, don't you?
She's against herself all the time.
They live in the same state.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Tom's already in French.
The earth went from father to son.
There are no roses without spikes.
I hope they're not.
Don't drink too much, okay?
You have to wait for a surprise tonight.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He left the family.
Shall we?
You don't have to contact Tom.
I'm shrieking.
I'm the boss.
Tom did a good job.
You have to get home by 9:00.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted he did it.
Tom can't drive.
Tom spent the day with his daughter.
Every student has his or her own desk.
We were ready.
I'm worried that I might get sued.
My family lives here.
Tom is listening.
I got away with it.
Tom speaks well French.
I know I'm learning a lot.
I went on Monday to catch fish.
Mary loved her dog.
The party is over.
The unicycle has one wheel.
"Dad, look over there, shark!" "It's a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very friendly.
I'm a nerd.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my fault, not Tom.
The meetings went pretty well.
At this time of year, the wind is blowing out of the ocean.
I saw Tom smiling.
Come on, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned it.
Go and beat that scoundrel.
This is our car.
Hi, I'm Basher!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I'm ashamed I did it.
Do I have to go to the hospital?
In her spare time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom sings "cantry" better than anybody else I know.
He drinks a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how dressed she is.
Have you seen his new movie?
I'm good at it.
Why did he quit?
Tom said Mary had gone.
I don't have enough money to buy this.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you like.
We have providers.
My unbiased idea is that it's a terrible movie.
You're very elegant.
As you wish.
I could have changed.
It's substantial.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
She's at Tom's.
Tom was barefoot.
I did my best.
If you see an error, please correct it.
We tried it again, but it didn't work.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do that.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You have to help her.
You can't pay for a bad cry.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to climb that mountain.
Tom skipped dinner.
You speak English well.
He loved his parents.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you'll come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love cannot be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What kind of theatre is this?
Did you see the squirrel?
Mary said Tom told her.
Tom wasn't a very good witness.
I went to visit my grandmother.
I hate weddings.
I heard the door in the front door swirl.
I'm not following you.
Mary's a wonderful dancer.
My uncle's from Osaka.
I want massage, I need to relax.
Tom's so happy.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Have you been able to sleep?
I was very honest.
I'm not sure who did it.
What do you think, when will Tom be here?
Is it snowing tonight?
Do you care?
Are you meeting someone here?
I live in Milana.
When did she do anything for me?
I ate the orange.
The square root of the two is an arbitrary number.
It's small.
Didn't you know this was going to happen?
Bad thoughts produce bad actions.
Did you bring the fenn?
Tom's not wrong.
Do you have a deposit from this bill?
Tom seems a little embarrassed.
We can't afford water.
I can't get my ideas together.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in a village.
I would never give up.
I speak French freely.
Tom wasn't wasting his time.
Insinuate me.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He's very drunk.
Tom claims he's satisfied.
How are you feeling now?
How many guys are there in your class?
It's a big apple.
Choose a thoughtful present.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something like that?
The richest man in the world could not buy his love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new wheels.
Missing news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers are saving us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You've been to London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I walk slowly.
After the movie they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We'll get married in June.
I was wondering if Tom had left Boston.
I threw my bones away.
There were several pages missing in the book.
I picked up the coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks a promise.
We have to protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sarah don't get along very well.
Every student has his or her own desk.
I spent 12 hours.
I'll hurt you about that.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom has no thirst.
I learned to eat the cow.
I'm civil.
I wish I was rich.
The news really upset her.
I've got a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see it yourself.
I never killed anybody.
How does your name sound?
She keeps flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old one's over nineteen.
This coffee is so hot I can't drink it.
Where did you get that?
Are we done?
Are you from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're good at doing this, aren't you?
These apples taste good.
Can I borrow your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She's got red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way to rest.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a policeman?
Tom didn't do anything we told him to do.
You haven't seen him.
I know Tom was lying to us.
Tom heard that Mary was married.
I've learned a lot.
How much does this paraplu cost?
They both laughed.
What happened?
It's possible.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everybody in Tom's class got flu.
Remember when you first heard the Beatles?
Is Tom hurt?
I want you to come to my party.
No toilet paper available.
The word is silver, the silence is gold.
Please sit here and wait.
I love that shirt.
Drink the water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved in last month.
Tom will probably still be angry.
I'll go to the airport.
Don't mind her whims.
I'm glad Tom will help us.
Tom will be here any minute.
Glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see each other again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I asked her out on a date.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks frightened.
When did you come to China?
Do you approve of what Tom's doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
It's the perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I'm asleep.
How is this my fault?
As for Switzerland, have you been there in the winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm learning Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay the loan debt.
Try looking at it from Tom's perspective.
The window has opened.
No one thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom looked pretty sick when I last saw him.
Tom's still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
Do you think you're funny?
I usually work from nine to five.
Let me do it with you.
Mary was watching a romantic comedy.
Grab him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom is such an asshole.
Would you like some more potatoes?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a moustache.
I have three questions for you.
I met Tom several times.
Do you use a text processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot together.
Please move.
What are you doing this evening?
Why did you paint the shop red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, right?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary both will be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not.
Let's go home.
I said hi to Tom.
Tom took off his ring.
I'll give you breakfast.
Tom was listening.
Who broke that window?
Your ideas are a bit out of date.
