The Archangelic Chief of Staff of Navany was sentenced to public works
At the October District Court of Archangelsk, the verdict was pronounced to the Regional Chief of Staff, Alexei Navelny Andrey Borowovikow.
For repeated breaches of the rules for holding rallies (article 212.1 of the Criminal Code, so-called Dadine article), the court ordered him 400 hours of work to be performed, and a "NO" correspondent from the court room reports to him.

A restraining measure has been adopted against me in the form of a restriction of liberty, which is that I cannot attend public public events and that I cannot communicate with the organisers of the protest on 7 April.
"All this time I wore an electronic bracelet and a base.
That's how they tracked my location.
I'll note that I was not restricted in the movement.
He recently flew in from Moscow, where he was trained," said Andrey Borowicz.
After the verdict had been pronounced, the Regional Chief of the Navalli staff announced that the sentence would be served in Archangelsk.

The defender of the Rabbit, Pavel Mogilevec, spoke about the reasons for the team's failure.
The Casanians in the Russian championship suffered four consecutive defeats and flew out of the Cup.
We're focused on every game, and we're quoting "The news" of the graveyard.
So each of us needs to think about the reasons for such a bad match.
We've got to get ready and fix things.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably have fixed it by now.
But first of all, I think we need to add to this component, that is, unite.
I think we have a problem with that.
The Kremlin supports the ban on smoking on the balconies of houses
The Kremlin supports any measure that will save lives, said President Dmitry Sandov's press secretary, commenting on the ban on smoking on the balconies and the flats.
Earlier, the cabmin had approved a change to the Fire Rules which prohibited the use of open fire on the balconies and the living-rooms.
Later, the Russian MES reported that this included a ban on smoking on the balconies and the flats and hotels.
The changes will take effect on 1 October 2019.
The breach is subject to administrative responsibility.
The Kremlin has a positive attitude toward any decision that helps save human lives.
"We know how many fires occur, many of them have very tragic consequences and social resonance.
So any saved life justifies such decisions," said Sandov.
First of all, the Spokesman sees this as a fire-fighting measure, not a way to protect his neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also pointed out that Russian President Vladimir Poetin did not welcome smoking and was an advocate of a healthy way of life.

China is strongly opposed to the adoption of the "Tai Bay Bill" by the US.
China strongly opposes the adoption by the US of the so-called “Tai Bay Bill” which seriously undermines the principle of one China and the principles of the three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the State Council for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.
The approval by the U.S. Senate Committee on International Relations of this bill also represents a serious breach of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and a grave interference in China's internal affairs, observed Ma Xiaoguan.
He said that Taiwan was part of China, and the issues involved related to China's internal affairs.
"We call upon the American side to make the situation clear, to cease immediately the relevant negative bills, and to cease immediately to interfere in the Taiwan question in order to avoid further damage to Chinese-American relations as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he remarked.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical tendency cannot be stopped by any force, as highlighted by Ma Xiaoguan.
TikTok hides bad videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Imagine China/Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok censored a video showing Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence or Falun Gong's illegal religious group, says The Guardian.
The documents before the publication show that the owner of TickTok (ByteDance) is an app that promotes China's foreign policy abroad.
Most of China's policy abuses fall under the “incitement of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok puts bad publications in a context that fits the general rules so that social networking does not look like censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under a general ban on “criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on mentioning incidents in the Tiananmen Square or the Cambodian genocide falls under the “discovery of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of the twenty “foreign leaders or statesmen” including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sen and Kim Jong Eun, the Indian politicians Mahatmu Gandhi, the American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, the Japanese premier Sindzo Abe, the South Korean President Park Kyung Hee, the Indonesian President Joko Vidodo and Indian premier Narendra Modi, as listed in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as set out in the document.
The first category of publications is removed by social media administrators and may result in the user locking.
Not much of a problem is in the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is restricted to the TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules were obsolete and no longer applied: "We now use a localized approach to modifying, as well as engaging independent local experts."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says the co-founder of the "Producer's Centre" Rustem Bohdanov.
The "Producer's Center" is one Russian media company that officially works with TikTok.
All the advertisements of the "Producer's Center" bloggers work with the social media, but the user's material can be placed without a negotiation, and handed over to the Bohdans.
On the question whether TikTok can talk about politics or Poetin, Boeddenov answers positively and says he's seen similar publications.
The founder of Our Digital Roman Zaripov agreed: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you can't put up shocking content, discriminating remarks, etc.
But under these rules, you can give any content that the monitors don't like, Zaripov notes.
Zaripova is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
By user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
The social media administrators test their age using artificial intelligence: neurosis analyzes their faces and determines how many years a person looks, tells the Bohdans.
If a neurose determines that the user is younger, its account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow in September 2019 in the area of WeWork's Coworker.
the inhabitants of Istanbul spoke of the earthquake in the city
A severe earthquake caused a panic in Turkey's largest city
Last Thursday, 26 September, an earthquake struck Istanbul with a magnetoid of 5.9.
Thirty-four people have been injured, ten of whom are still in hospitals.
A resident of Istanbul, Melica, admitted that she had had a panic attack for the first time in her life.
"I cried so much.
She was crying right in the workplace.
Later, it became easier, and I went back to business.
But I'm so ashamed now!" said the girl at the 360th Channel.
"In Istanbul there was a really big earthquake.
I can't go back till now!
But in general, I'm fine." - shared his impressions with political scientist Jalan Ozguil.
Celine's project manager said that the city's mayor kept everyone informed, but she said that the city still felt a little magnetoid about 3,2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the problem of communications immediately after the earthquake.
She said she couldn't reach her mother, but the Internet worked "good" and she could send a message via WhatsApp.
As KP.ru wrote, after the earthquake, all nursery schools and schools from which all students were evacuated were closed.
473 buildings were damaged.

But everybody makes mistakes.
And the club and I were talking about how to deal with the situation.
I don't think anything's wrong with our relationship.
The results of the amputation check were reported to the child in Roshland.
A child in Rostov oblast was amputated because of a doctor's mistake, reports "View" with a link to the site of the Rostov Watcher Territory.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm, and he was given a gips at the Selnograd District hospital.
After a while, the child developed a gangrene and was amputated.
The test found that there were problems with the timing and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as with the standard and the amount of assistance provided.
The verification file has been submitted to the Russian SC SOC for the region.
URA.RU had previously reported that he had arrested the head of the Southern Grandmaidshop.
Russians were warned of false calls from banks
There has been an increase in the number of calls from fraudsters in Russia who are replacing the bank's phone number.
This is reported by Commersant with a reference to the Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the controller provided communications operators with more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which the clients of various financial organizations had been called.
In 189 cases, the operators found a replacement number.
An additional 218 numbers have been blocked and 59 have restricted the use of financial services.
The deputy head of the CS Information Security Department, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks had encountered the replacement of the number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings of fraud calls because of the absence of such a duty in the Communications Act.
At the Open Bank, Rosbanke and the Alpha bank confirmed an increase in the number of cheating calls with a number swap.
As reported by the Bilaya press, some of the information about the fraud that was handed over to the CB was incorrect: the lists included numbers that were actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would cause a breakdown in the organization's work.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank was planning to create a database of fraudster numbers, which the communications operator would contact at each call to check the number.
He explained that such a basis would require changes in the law.

Stoltenberg discussed Ukraine's green accession to the North Atlantic
The UN General Secretary, Jens Stoltenberg, and the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greenski, discussed Ukraine's membership in an alliance on the margins of the United Nations '74th General Assembly.
This was reported by the gensec during a presentation at Columbia University in New York.
In response to a question as to whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they had indeed discussed the matter and stressed that his reply did not specify the date of Ukraine's accession to NATO.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic alliance was obliged to meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, RT wrote.
Crimea offered an alternative to a course in the North Atlantic
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir of Zelenski, should instead embark on the establishment of good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
This was reported on Friday, 27 September by the co-chairman of the Assembly of the Slovak People of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Chegrinets.
"Mr. President of Ukraine does not need to repeat the mistakes of his previous, but rather to heed the advice of [the President of the United States], which he listened to with a sour face, and to establish a relationship with the President of Russia," said the Chegrin journalist "RlA News."
The Chegrin remarked that Zelenski was a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
He said that the Ukrainian President would be able to remain in power only if relations with the Russian Federation were established.
Earlier on September 27, the UNOG Gens Jens Stoltenberg announced that he had had a conversation with the Greenskis on the country's accession to the alliance.
He said that Ukraine was obliged to meet certain conditions in order to do so.
On 5 June, the deputy was pleased to announce that Ukraine's possible joining the alliance did not guarantee a better life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
"Barcelona" is blackmailing Naymar.
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer, Neimar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that emerged after the attacker's transition to the French Paris St. Germain.
The case had almost reached trial, but the Catalans had suggested that the player settle the dispute without the interference of the Femidians.
Otherwise they refuse him to return.
Naymar and his clever father, who is also a Brazilian agent, had an interesting focus: by agreement with the Barza, which the player signed in 2016, he was expected to earn 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the foreward ended up in the SWF for the record 222 million euros.
However, he's got 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18 away.
Besides, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for the late payment.
When Neumar's claims became known in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.
Blue Grains insists that the bonus was based on the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
The club therefore considered that the player had only a quarter of 40 million euros and required a proportional part of the first payment.
But the interesting thing is, in the summer, Naymar and the Barsa almost agreed to the return of the misguided player to the valley of Catalonia.
True, the deal has failed, but the hope of a forward transition remains.
And so, according to Sports.Ru, referring to the insiders, the club lawyers told the players that if the issue of financial claims was not resolved in the pre-trial order, it would prevent the Brazilian from returning.
Naymar himself wants to come back so much that he asked for assurances that the Catalans would buy him back.

At the same time, the Reform Party wanted to replace Yaanus Tamkivi with Andres Suttie.
But Laar replied that the goal of the Reform Party was to get two seats on the bank of Estonia's council -- so that, in addition to Yaanus Tamkivi, Andres Suttt would join the council.
On Tuesday, 24 September, the Riigikogu rejected the offer of Laar to appoint new members of the Board of the Bank of Estonia.

How to increase future pension and not process
It is possible to pay a pension not only to the Russian pension fund but also to non-State pension funds.
NFP is a private company, says "The Volgograd truth.ru."
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the foundation invests them, and eventually returns interest.
If you're interested in this, you should first study information about the NFP on the Bank of Russia website.
All foundations work according to the common rules set by the federal laws.
You can buy your retirement points by law.
The number of missing points depends on how many years of service you have not enough to calculate your pension.
This is a way for people who have been working informally.
In addition, a contribution may be made for a relative, such as a homewife.

Media visited the fourth power plant of the BAEC
A video video of the fourth power plant control unit on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant appeared on the Internet and was first published on YouTube by the Ruptly video company.
It is reported that a group of 15 media representatives had access to the fourth BAEC reactor management room as part of a presentation of a guide on the exclusion zone.
According to Telegram RT, journalists were there in special protective suits for less than five minutes, as the ruins of the blasted power plant still run out of radiation, 40,000 times the norm.
The accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant occurred on the night of April 26, 1986.
There were 12 areas of radiation pollution in Ukraine and 23% of the area of Belarus.
In Russia 19 regions were affected.
Remember, in July this year the Ukrainian leader, Vladimir Zelenski, signed a decree that established a green corridor open to tourists in the Chernobyl region.
Also in the exorcism zone, the filming ban is lifted.
It has been previously reported that the Black Sea Exclusion Area has been opened for tourists from Belarus.
Tourists have stressed that there is less radiation available in the area than during flight.

Tarasov's role played in his Instagram.
After that, Tarasov called on Alexey and Anton Miranchuk, a rap performer of T-Killah, as well as bloggers from YouTube Channel 2DROTS.
Sweden published a hashtag video with #matrixhallenge, where it keeps the ball on its chest, leaning backwards, and moves with its hands, like the main character of the film "The Matrix" Neo, who in one of the scenes similarly shunned the bullets flying into it.
Ibraikowitsch offered to replay the trick of the "Monchester United" Paul Pogba, the tennis player Novuk Jokowitsch, the Russian UFC champion Habib Nurmagomedov and his agent Mino Raiolet, noting them on record.

On TNT, they didn't think raper Goof was good enough for the "Bloody" show.
On the Internet, a few days ago, they condemned whether rapper Goof was worthy of being the new "Blood."
He was also reminded of his numerous adulterys and experiences with escorts, and had even decided that the musician wanted to be reinstated for the scandalous music video Moscow, which had received a record number of displayers from the audience.
But the entire administration of the TNT channel decided to stop all the trials together.
Goof won't be the new member of the "Blood" show.
The official press statement stated that he had been considered for this role, but that he had finally chosen another candidate.
Who could be better than Goof?
Yeah, basically, anybody...

Was it a show?
Thank you.
And for those who said I was suffocating in the third round...

Which club will take the paroled Pavel Mamiev
A soccer player named Pavel Mamiev, released last week from the parole colony, will not return to the Red Doll Football Club.
The former quarterback of this club may soon sign a contract with the Russian FC, reports the Championate Portal.
According to the publication, the talks between the representatives of Rostov and Mamiev are now in the final stage.
It is assumed that a contract with a 31-year-old football player will be signed for two years, with the possibility of an extension for another season.
"Sport-Express" writes that Pavel Mamiev was supposed to have a medical examination the previous day at the Moscow Dinamo, but the check was not made due to the "undefined situation at the club."
The Transnodar terminated the contract with Majev last week by agreement of the parties.
The defender has been playing for the Reddress Club since 2014.
He won the Russian championship's armor twice with the team.
Formerly, Momev was a champion of the Moscow "Torpedo" and the CSKA.
From 2009 to 2016, Momev played for Russia with 15 games.
Together with the Zenita player Alexander Cocorin Mamiev, he was sentenced for taking part in a fight in the centre of Moscow last October.
In mid-Sept. they were released from prison on parole.
Zenit signed a new contract with Cocorine.
A man with a samurai sword tried to resist what was found in a pile of garbage cart.
A resident of the U.S. city of Auckland Park, Florida, was arrested for attempted murder after he had hit his opponent with a samurai sword because of a cart found in the trash.
54-year-old Kurtis Miller was digging into a pile of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, who took an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the trash.
Miller saw Beavers' find and got upset.
He thought he could claim a cart because he started digging into the trash first.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly Bivers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he had found in that pile and began chasing the opponent.
He caught up with Bivers outside his house.
Miller pulled his sword out of his knife and started waving it in the direction of the cart's kidnapper.
Beavers told Miller that what's going on is being videotaped.
After seeing the video camera, Miller escaped, but threatened to come back.
Bivers left the cart in the yard and walked into the house.
Shortly afterward he saw a woman come into his yard and pick up the cart, shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller for driving an unlicensed car.
The man was arrested and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the U.S. city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager had attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.
He thus reacted that the guests at the wedding, which had been celebrated at the same hotel where he was staying, had prevented him from smoking.
Massive riots at three
The Moscow case against the participants in the summer protests, the more noticeable it is, it loses its political content.
The evidence of the very fact of the “mass disorder” does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to bring the case to a standstill, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the dismissal of the charges.
The breakdown of the case should encourage society, but it would certainly leave it in the extreme annoyance of the stewards, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence had proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disturbances), Alexei Minyello, was suddenly released without any obligation, and after a few hours and completely reinstated, the SCR dropped the charges.
Minylo had been arrested for almost two months, and several professional communities had joined him: historians, clergymen, and writers.
Afterwards, only two accused of participating in the riots remained in the case (the original accused was 13): Sergei Fomin, transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samariddin Rajabov, who was arrested on the previous day by the court until the end of December (he is also accused of violence against the official, art. 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of the joke petition to join Latvia in the United States
The Videm District Court of Riga sentenced the author of a joke petition for Latvia to join the United States of America, Denis Bartezki.
It is reported that 80 hours of corrections and one year of probation have been assigned to the man.
"Health is not the most powerful part of our system," remarked the Bartez judgment.
He added that usually the penalty is less than that requested.
The collection of Latvian signatures to join the US was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, along with this petition, the site collected signatures on Latvia's accession to the "Galactic Empire" and on the country's exit from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is stated that a criminal case has been brought against Bartezki under the first paragraph of article 82 of the Criminal Law of the Republic of Latvia, “a public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.
Before that, in 2016, the author of Latvia's online petition for accession to Russia had received six months' imprisonment.
In Khabarovsk, he made an emergency landing by a Japanese aircraft
Boeing, who flew from Austria to Japan, made an emergency landing at Khabarovska airport, reports TASS.
On board a Japanese-owned ANA aircraft company there were 206 people, including 12 crew members.
It is observed that there are no casualties.
The people from Tokyo were followed by another flight.
According to the agent of the airport, the result was a drop in oil pressure in one of the aircraft's engines.
It was previously reported that a plane flying from the Zhukovski Moscow airport to Kirgizia had made an emergency landing at Samara airport due to a sick child on board.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to punish police officers for insulting them online.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs has prepared revisions to the police law in order to protect the security guards from spreading slanderous and dishonoring information on the Internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill was made on the Federal Legal Portal, and the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The Explanatory Note to the paper states that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honour and dignity of a police officer from “distribution to information and communication networks, including on the Internet”, of a pernicious nature, including discrediting information.
The exact way in which police officers are expected to be protected from libel in the network is not specified.
However, the explanation of the document indicates that the provisions of the amendments will be applied “by the individualization of the mechanism” already provided for by the Act on the freezing of posts insulting the authorities and the Act on fines for such posts.
Both laws came into force in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public debate and independent anti-corruption evaluation.
According to the memorandum, the changes to the police law are due to take effect in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Poetin signed a law to punish "exact contempt of the State" on the Internet.
According to this document, Roscomnadzor warns the resource of a breach and gives it 24 hours to repair it.
A fine of between 30 and 300,000 roubles is provided for for the first breach of the ban and administrative detention for a period of up to 15 days.
On April 12 Roscomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslav edition.
Shortly afterwards, the Novgorod District Court fined the local resident 30,000 roubles for placing on the network “two indecent entries that violate human dignity and public morals and express a clear contempt for society, the State, the authorities exercising public authority in the Russian Federation”.
Mortgage reduction date
The rate of rent in Russia will decrease by the end of 2019.
This was announced by Alexander Plutnik, Director General of Dom.F, and handed over to Interfax.
As Plutnik said at a panel in the Ministry of the Russian Federation, most banks will carry out another reduction in their hypothetical rates in the remaining months of the year, and the market average will reach 8.9 per cent, the level set by the national project “Living and the urban environment”.
According to the project's passport, in 2019 the average rate of the hypothecary is 8.9 per cent, in 2021 it is 8.5 per cent, and in 2024 it is 7.9 per cent.
The programme provides for “the provision of accessible shelter for middle-income families, including the creation of opportunities to purchase (the construction of their home using a hypothetical loan at a rate of less than 8 per cent)”.
Earlier in September, it was reported that one of the largest players in the Russian Mortgage market, Sberbank, was planning to carry out a further reduction in the rate of rent by the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens extend youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens has not been sufficiently studied.
Of the most famous are pine pollen.
The phyto estrogens, on the other hand, are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer).
The known sources of phytoestrogen are all beans (the most popular soy), hops, and leen seeds.
However, many experts believe that such ADDs cannot be a complete substitute for natural hormones.
Possible harm from such additions could not be excluded.
For example, their intake can reduce the production of their own hormones by taking too many external analogues into the body.
Vertennikov was called upon to revive the Kazakh Jennis.
Former Russian attacker Rothor and the Russian team, Oleg Vertennikov, joined the action to revive the Kazakh "Geniz".
The club, known for various years as Dinamo, Cologne, Astana and Genice, was dissolved in 2014.
Vertennikov protected its colors in 2004 and 2008.
"Revealed the Jenice Football Club campaign organized by its fans.
I couldn't stay away!
I spent a season and a half in this club.
It wasn't the best time in terms of results and funding, but I'll never forget this club and its dedicated fans, who were always with the team!
The Munitepassov Stadium, where I scored my 200th ball in my career, will always be remembered!
"Jenis" has to re-emerge!
He's got a huge story and great fans.
I wish them all the best and believe that the city's authorities will return their home club!" wrote Vertennikov at Instagram.
The Bastion complex launched an Onyx rocket at Chukotka.
The DOD first fired a cruise rocket from the Bastion complex on Chukotka.
The Onyx began at a distance of 350 miles, and 200 of them flew over the land, a record for this type of rocket.
Some 10 Pacific ships and aircraft, as well as maritime aircraft, provided security for the shooting, reported to the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation.
The Bastion complexes have never been used in Chukotka before.
The Hydromethod Centre called the faithful folkmarks
There are many popular receptions in Russia where people are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydromethod Center checked all the signs that were supposed to work.
The meteorologists concluded that only two of them can really be trusted, though, in the short term.
As the scientific director of the Russian Hydromettic Center, Roman Wilfund, said, if the sun is red during the sunset, the next day will indeed be a good day, as our ancestors have marked.
And if the sky shined white, it would rain the next day.
The second working sign is based on bird observation.
It's more common to talk about squirrels, if they fly low, it's usually in the rain.
It's easy to explain -- when the air is heavy, the mossoors are soaking their wings and the feathers are forced to fall to hunt insects, writes the TASS.
On different continents, there are popular signs.
Sour Day is a traditional popular holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that this day you must observe a chap who climbs out of his hole to determine the time of spring.
Unrecognised oil spots found on the beaches of north-east Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in north-east Brazil.
Areas of pollution have been scattered 2,000 miles [2,000 km] of the coastline.
Reports of the first oil spots discovered began on September 2.
However, their number continued to rise every day until Thursday, as did their geographical scope.
The Brazilian Institute for the Environment carried out a chemical analysis of the detected samples.
It turns out they're all identical and it's about raw oil.
At the State Oil Company, which had been presented with the samples found, the oils were said to be not in line with the oil extracted from the fields on Brazilian soil.
"It's thick oil.
It may be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it got into the ocean," told the Brazilian news portal G1, the Coordinater of the Pernambuco Oil Workers' Union and Paraíb Rogerio Almeida.
He added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmentalists discovered nine sea turtles covered entirely with oil film.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment, together with the company Petrobras, will start cleaning the polluted beaches.
In the meantime, the institute advises tourists and locals to bypass the oil spots and report all the spots found.
Medvedev has ordered a revision of the standards for common-market companies
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev had instructed Rostillenadzor, the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Prompromprogue, together with the business and business communities, to review the health-epidemiological rules and standards for the general public.
They will also have to study the transition to the requirements of the Eurasian Economic Union for food management.
The government is required to submit its proposals to the Government no later than 15 October, as indicated in Mr. Medvedev's list of tasks following the 11 September "Dialogue" programme on the "Russia 24" television channel.
By the same time, Mr. Medvedev had instructed all the above-mentioned agencies, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals for an experiment to limit control activities to common-wealth organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad.
The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economics had been requested to introduce a bill to the Government before 11 November, which had been amended by the CAP, on the application of administrative stays for violations of the requirements for the organization of food which had caused health damage.
In addition, the Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Economics, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance need to consider gradually moving from 2021 to the creation of a consumer basket based on a basic set of products that allow for a healthy diet.
Let's remind you that the business community talked about obsolete requirements after closing one cafe from the UnderSone network.
The business community demanded that the existing São Pinos be revoked, and Rospresnadzor announced the joint development of new ones.
Thirty-three agencies have been listed.
Meanwhile, Rosneslavnadzor aims to reduce the number of health standards and regulations by 40 times by 2021.
At present, officers have information about three thefts in which the detained person is involved.
A man was employed in the Tula district of Skuratov.
He stole batteries and car magnets from his cars.
Of the two cars, BAS-2106 and BAS-2107, the kidnapper took the batteries, presumably for further sale.
"And from another Vaz-2107 car for the same purpose, the intruder took the car magnetol and the sabwoofer," reported the U.S.A. in the Tull oblast.
The perverted intruder probably intended to resell.
A 26-year-old unemployed person is currently in detention.
Russians have nothing to save for their retirement - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Valentine's Federation Council, Matvienko, believes that Russians do not have enough money to make the draft law on the guaranteed pension product fully operational in the country.
The practice of increasing personal pension is common around the world.
It's another matter of how early we have it.
"In my view, a large part of the population now has incomes from which they simply have nothing to spend to increase pension in the future," said V. Matvienko.
The Russians, in the opinion of the Speaker, are unable to understand the mechanisms of pension formation and administration, as “the constant changes in this field have completely confused them”.
That doesn't mean I'm against improving the pension system that governs its legislation.
"Russia is a social State, and we have to do everything we can to make sure that citizens' pensions and social protection improve.
But the steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic reality," said V. Matvienko, "RlA News."
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on the guaranteed pension product) were to be developed, there should be several basic principles, including volunteering, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict State guarantees and responsibility for the security of pension saving.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that a bill on the guaranteed pension product (PPP) should be sent for negotiation.
Among its main elements are the purely voluntary procedure for citizens to join the system of saving, the guarantee of the security of long-term pension saving on the part of the State, the registration of citizens' accumulated accounts by the central administrator, tax relief for business and tax deductions for citizens.

Sony and Disney have a deal.
Getty Images Image Caption The news of the departure of a beloved superhero from the cloaked Marvel has angered many devoted fans
One of the most famous comic book heroes -- Spider-Man -- will stay in the cloaked Marvel.
Disney and Sony Pictures have managed to agree on the rights to use it in film franchises.
This was reported by Sony's press release, which states that the third part of Spider-Man with Tom Holland will appear on the screen on July 16, 2021.
It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures had not been able to reach a consensus on income sharing, so Spider-Man would leave Marvel.
Sony owns the film hero's rights.
She gave them to lease for the Marvel film, which belongs to Disney.
As a result, Sony received income from film cassettes and Disney from souvenirs and toys.
It was reported that at some point this situation had ceased to take place with Disney, and the company wanted to renegotiate the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Faigi said he was excited.
It's amazing that Spidey's journey in the cosmic Marvel will continue.
"We all at Marvel Studios are very happy that we can continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a symbolic figure.
It's a hero whose history affects all generations and audiences around the world," says his press release.
At that time, Faigi reminded me that Sony was also creating his own cozy, built around Spider-Man.
"So it happened that he was the only superpowered hero who found himself in different bones.
So while Sony continues to develop his own Spidey universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he remarked.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five movies, apparently commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account an excerpt from "The Wall Street Wolf," in which the hero Leonardo de Caprio shouted "I'm not leaving!"
Information on company conflicts appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to get half the cash from Spider-Man movies, provided both companies paid half the cost of painting.
But it didn't suit Sony.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from the imaginary Marvel has angered many devoted fans.
The details of the new conditions are not yet publicized.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but said, "We have been working perfectly together for the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together has been in proportion to the wishes of many fans [Space-Man].
We're glad we can go forward together."
The film "Avengers: Final", which brought together Spider-Man, Torah, Hulk, and other superheroes in Marvel, became the most cashier ever in the history of the world's film, putting the Avatar first.

In the description, Winnik became part of Russia's anti-Ukrainian propaganda campaign #world, which aims to transfer responsibility for Russia's (aggressor country) war to Ukraine.
Let us recall that Vladimir Pozner, Mireille Mathieu (France), Alessandro Safina (Italy), Valeria, Soso Pavliasvili, Igor Cool, Zara, Tamara Gwertzentel, Denis Clover, Valery Sutkin, Dmitry Malikov, Maxim Polytski, Ian Polyatski, Maxim Averin, Xenia Alferov, Nonna Grishaev and others took part in the video.
Most of the participants in the flashmob publicly support the Kremlin's aggressive policy.
Vinnik became the only Ukrainian member of the project.
In the press service, the singer had previously explained that the artist had been involved in a project to support the International Day of Peace, which was celebrated on 21 September, and that his patriotic position had not changed.
Remember, there was a wave of indignation in the network.
The video itself is called a mockery.
How can artists who have visited occupied Crimea support the politics of Poetin, who waged a war on Donbass, where almost every day people die, talk about peace?
Four people have been convicted for a series of burglaries in Khabarovsk.
In Khabarovsk, the court sentenced four inhabitants of the village of Friendship, who for two years had robbed the houses of the Cosmos and the Rainbows in the Black River region.
This is reported by the IA on September 27, "The Chabarian Land Today."
The criminal group included previously unconvicted men aged 31 and 37 and two brothers aged 21 and 24.
It was found that the inspirator of crime was the older brother who had been in juvie for young people.
He robbed nine houses on his own, and later the others joined.
The damage from each of the thefts ranged from three to 21,000 roubles.
The criminals took away stoves, fridges, curtains, buckets, gas tanks, chairs, tombs and many other items.
They were apprehended by a security alarm in the last house.
The defendants were found guilty of theft of illegal entry into the dwelling, causing considerable damage to a group of persons by collusion.
“Brothers are sentenced to three years' imprisonment in a general-regime colony, two other defendants to two years' imprisonment, 10 months' imprisonment and six months' imprisonment,” quotes the senior assistant prosecutor of the Khabarovsk district, Julia Vasiliev.
Bears: Cocorine continues to train on individual program
Forward of the Peterburg "Zenita" Alexander Cocorin continues to train on an individual program after his release on parole, reports TASS with a reference to Alexander Medvedev's Director General.
Last Thursday, 26 September, the attacker began training with Zenit-2.
Photo with Cocorin posted in his Instagram a second team teacher to the blue-white-blue Vladislav Radimov.
Medvedev had previously reported that Cocorine might play for Zenit in the fall in a friendly match.
In official meetings, the forward will be able to display itself after 22 January 2020 and will be registered in the nearest transfer window.
Remember, on October 8, 2018, Cocorine, his younger brother, Cyril, Paul Mamiev's "Redmaker" Howback, and Alexander Protosovitzki's child coach organized a series of fights in the centre of Moscow.
Drunk sportsmen beat three people.
For a long time they've been in custody.
In May 2019 the court sentenced them to real prison terms.
The Cocorins' brothers were sent to prison for a year and a half, and Mamiev and Prostasovski were sent to prison for one year and five months.
In September 2019, the court granted the application for parole to sportsmen except Prostasovsky.
The first battles according to Alexander Emelianenko's rules will take place on November 29th.
The first battles of the MMA by the rules that Alexander Emelianenko had invented will take place in Moscow on November 29, in an undercard boxing match between Yemelianenko and the Strongman Michael Cokleev.
We've lost our fights in the sights," said Yemelianenko in an interview with "SE."
There's no one to look at.
So I came up with a new kind of mixed fighting, Universal World Fight.
The rules are three different rounds.
MMA is a sport where all the martial arts are collected.
A mixed-style fighter must be able to do everything--and work in a bar, and fight, and in a desk to work.
The first round is just the shock machine at the counter.
The second round is only a struggle, and the reception time is limited to 30 seconds.
Round three is all allowed.
When will the first tournament take place according to the rules you invented?
November 29th.
In the undercard of our fight with Cokeyev.
But we don't know exactly how many battles we're going to have.

Trade with Russia is not just a tank.
The trade between Russia and India can double because of the geo-politic situation.
At the Vth anniversary Forum of Small and Medium Business Regions of the SCO and BRIX countries, the Vice-Director of the Indian Industry, Manish Kumar, spoke about this.
We need to learn from the SCO and BRlX countries, including Russia, a visitor from New Delhi.
- In our confederation, 9,000 direct members and 300,000 partner companies from 130 countries.
All of this is a small and medium-sized business that works with the countries of the Shanghai Organization.
And we're not standing there, we're developing, and all these sanctions against Russia and the geopolitic situation at all are just helping us all grow.
Our two-way trade now exceeds $10 billion, but these numbers can be doubled.
First of all, through new technologies in health, artificial intelligence and robotics.
Our trade is not just tanks and heavy industry.
According to Manish Kumar, India has already established its first contacts with modern Russian centers.
For example, a delegation from New Delhi and other cities recently visited Skolowo and Innopolis.
We have signed a memorandum to create systems in which we can build our modern business.
I mean, business isn't a passion, it's a need.
A necessary step towards economic well-being.
We need to expand, attract small and medium-sized business, and together with Russia, China and other countries, we will certainly do so, underlined by the Indian industry.
Remember, Ufa hosts the SCO and BRIX Small and Medium Business Forum for the fifth consecutive time.
From 25 to 27 September, more than 2,800 people from Russia and 31 countries from the world took part in the Forum.
As part of a work trip to Tobolsk, the governor of the Tumen region, Alexander Moor, took part in the solemn opening of the Sokolov Water Abatement after reconstruction.
Now its productivity is 25,000 cubic metres per day.
The reconfiguration of the water collection took place as part of the implementation of the Clean Water project of the Ecology project.
The authorities were assisted by the investor: the Sokolov Water Collection was another example of the use of the private-public partnership mechanism.
The Tumen region has a unique experience of interaction in this area between the federal structures, the regional authorities, local administrations and the private investor.
New Artesian wells have emerged at the site.
There were pumping stations built above them.

Water treatment plants will be expanded to Wagay
At the Congres, Trump and Zelenski had a "Russian trail" conversation.
In the lower house of the United States Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of having been involved in the scandal caused by the telephone conversation between the head of the White House, Donald Trump, and the Ukrainian President, Vladimir Zelenski.
The assumption that the Russians might somehow be behind this story was made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nance Pelosi, who broadcasts MSNBC News.
"Russia seems to have attached a hand to this," said the democrat, but she did not comment on it.
The Pelosian-led democrats, who hold the majority in the chamber, have earlier announced the launching of an impeachment procedure against the President.
This happened after a Trump C.I. complained about it.
The informant suspected that Trump had put pressure on his interviewer in a conversation with Zelenski in July to take up a case against the son of former Vice President Joseph Biden, the latter of which could become a Trump competitor in the elections after a year.
The White House had to provide the conventioners and the public with a script of scandalous conversation.

Member of the State Council, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the PRC Wang Yi, met with UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres at the United Nations Office in New York on Thursday.
As A. Gutterish said at the meeting, China plays a vital role in creating a multipolar world.

Multipolarity cannot be realized without multi-latterism, whose symbols are the basic purposes and principles set out in the UN Charter.
According to the Minister, China advocates a more active role for the United Nations, supports the work of the world's secretary-general and strictly adheres to the basic ideas and principles of the UN Charter.
Next year will mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, and the Chinese side intends to take this opportunity to enhance cooperation with the world organization in order to work together to create a beautiful future for the world.

There's also a special QR code that will help you access the site and access all the information.
"The tongue is well hung," wrote the inventor in Russian in response to the invitation, conveys teeleprogramma.pro.

The expert explained why tea should be discarded in packages
A team of Canadian researchers from the University of McGill found that in five minutes more than ten billion microplastic particles are poured into a cup of tea.
A food safety expert named Elizavet Thinoff said, "Nation News can also add particles of sawdust to the packaged drink.
According to the farmer, the consumer could not obtain reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer could add ingredients that would not be shown on the package.
The sawmills are not thrown away at the end of the season, so they may end up in tea.
"More than that, the packets don't always include tea plants," said Tikhonov.
She said that it would be best not to use such a drink in favour of a whiskey that is sold in specialized stores.
She also stressed that the risk of packed tea lies not only in the composition but also in the method of producing it - microparticles heat up to high temperature, so that they can start producing dangerous substances.
"The best way to buy clean green or black tea is to have the least extra in this drink," said the expert.

Regionals were invited to share business support secrets
On 27 September, the President of the Federation's Economic Policy Committee, Andrew Kutepov, sent a letter to the Minister for Economic Development, Maxim Oreshkin, and to the Minister of Finance, Anton Silwanov, inviting them to express their position on the Federation's initiative to improve legislation on support for small and medium-sized business (SMEs).
It's time to build cross-border links
The Council of the Federation Economic Policy Committee compiled information from the regions on their business development and legalization programmes for self-employed persons and on the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions reported to the Senators on problems in the development of SMEs and put forward suggestions for improving existing legislation.
“To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions has indicated the lack of information on regional business development programmes in the country as a whole,” said Andrew Kutepov.
In an attachment to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments in the regions on the legalization of self-employment and a summary of information from regions with suggestions and issues (available in the version).
In addition to the relevant ministries, summary data from the regions have also been sent to the heads of the regional government.
Exchange of information on successful developments in the regions could stimulate the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step in such an exchange would be to send the information available to the Economic Policy Committee," said the Senator in the "Parliament Paper."
Useful experience
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and have successfully implemented support programs for small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, in the Vologoda region there is an Enterprise Support Centre which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In Ivanov oblast, a business support system has been developed to implement the single window principle through multifunctional centers.
In Krasnodar Province, the beginning of the farm consumer co-operatives are provided with subsidies from the country budget.
There is a cluster development centre in Orlow Oblast.
The Amorian region of the "Acceleration of Small and Medium Enterprises" project provides for the possibility of subsidies to business incubators based on existing non-State cohorts from the federal budget.
A number of other regions have adopted special support measures for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-occupied people continue to get out of the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes should be made to existing legislation in order to better support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the archangelic region has suggested that the term “self-employment” be replaced with “entrepreneurial activity” because it is “most compatible with the content of the public service to support the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In Ivanov oblast, it is considered necessary to introduce changes to expand the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities related to the repair and repair of living quarters, construction and physical training.
The BRANl oblast considers it important to improve the control of malpractice dairy products by using the Mercury Veterinary System.
And in the Kostrom and Magadian regions, they advocate for the legal and legalization of social entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship support.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of government support programs for small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of government support programs for small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills," assured Andrew Kutepov.
A flight company has helped passengers avoid having to live with crying children
Japan Airlines (JAL) launched a new function: when you book the plane, you can find out where the little kids are going to sit.
Now, if you want to live with them, you can avoid them.
Japan Airlines (JAL) passengers were given the opportunity to use the new option and to avoid unwanted neighborhoods with young children.
The air carrier has started a function that allows you to track where the kids are going to sit.
In the course of booking, passengers will be able to see a picture of a child's head in a place occupied by children between eight days and two years of age.
So those who don't want to fly next to the kids because of the possible inconveniences associated with their crying can get as far away from them as possible.
Internet users using the air company were excited about the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other air companies should do the same.
One of the users complained that he had flown from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and three crying children were sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested that "adult-only flights" be introduced, expressing his willingness to pay for such a flight.
Many tourists observed that they would now try to always choose Japan Airlines for their movements, as they saw nothing pleasant about flying next to a crying child in a closed space.
Earlier, a woman who had travelled with a baby had tried to cheer her companions on the Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She had prepared for each of the 200 passengers a bag of sweets, each containing an apology note.
Did Oleg Tabakov's train appear in the metro?
If you regularly use the Kaleusko-Rige Line (which is what most Konykow people do), you'll be surprised.
A new theme train called "The Great Russian Artist Oleg Tabakov" was launched in the subway.
Every day this particular convoy transports 10,000 people.
He runs the orange line and talks about the director, actor, and founder of the Tabakerca Theatre.
By the way, Konykow has the right to drive performances that play on the new stage of the theatre (it is on the Small Suharev Square, near the subway of Sukharevskaya).
As explained to us in the Moscow metropolitan press office, "the external design of the subject train uses images of pieces of the glass of the new stage and places portraits of Oleg Tabakov in symbolic images created by him in theatre, movies and cartoons."
The train talks about his family, the play "Mathros Silence," which began a great life in the theatre, the Tabakerca itself, and the directorship.
On the walls of the wagons you can see rare archival images and images from movies.
Russian gays with adopted children sought asylum in the United States
A same-sex couple of Russians with two adopted children requested asylum in the U.S., sending the RIA "News".
Men were reported to have left the Russian Federation for Ukraine and then travelled to the States where they applied for asylum.
According to the Stimul group, the family's basis for such actions was the “continuing interest of law enforcement agencies”.
Reportedly, men are not planning to return to Russia.
Children have been attending American school since the beginning of the school year and are adapting to new conditions.
It was previously reported that a case had been brought against members of the social protection department of the Mariino district because of the adoption by a same-sex family of two young boys.
The HRW stated, however, that the raising of children by same sex should not in itself be a cause for prosecution.

Pavel Ustinov joined the pickets in support of the "Moscow business"
Actor Pavel Ustinov joined a series of "Freedom All" single pickets, which are held on Friday outside the Russian President's office in Moscow, and is broadcast by Interfax.
A series of pickets began on September 18, in support of Ustinov himself, and has since continued every day.
At present, the participants in the campaign, in exchange for each other, are standing in their hands with a poster labeled "Freedom to All" and the names of the convicted and arrested persons following unharmonized meetings in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, on the poster the names of Egor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Danila the fugitive, Yevgeny Kovalenko, Constantine Kotov, Ivan Podkonov, Aydar Goubaidin, Alexei Minyilo, Sergei Fomin, Samariddin Rajabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Edward Kleinevski, Vladislav Sinica.
On 16 September, the Moscow Court sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to a 3.5-year-old general-regime colony accused of using violence against a UMO soldier at Rosgwardia on 3 August in an unharmonized action in the centre of Moscow (art.
On 20 September, at the request of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the court changed the detention measure from detention to a non-removal subscription.
Thus, the petition for the release of Ustinov received more than 112,000 signatures within 24 hours.
The theatre and film artists started a flashmob in support of a colleague.
In order to participate in a single picket in solidarity with the actor on September 18, a queue was set up on the Old Square.
The case was called for by human rights activists, journalists, academics, teachers, doctors, and Christian clergymen.
According to the Interfax sister of Ustinov Julia, her brother is not planning to speak at a meeting in the capital on 29 September to support the members of the Moscow case.
The supply of "sanctions" to Russia dropped 100 times.
In the Russian Government, it was estimated that the supply of farm products and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo had decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Poetin, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019, compared to 3 million 4422,000 tons in a similar period in 2013, reported by Interfax.
However, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4,975.5 million, respectively.
This is the supply of goods that have not been subject to the embargo.
As indicated in the report, off-the-shelf imports from the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia were offset.
Remember that at the end of August the government extended until 31 December 2020 the rules for the destruction of farm products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from entering Russia by means of contraband.
The document on the official legal information portal indicated that the rules were extended for another year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Originally, the destruction order applied to products from the US, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Since 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Ukraine have joined the list since 1 January 2016.
A decree on the destruction of illegal “sanctions” (the food-embargo products which Moscow had introduced in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) had entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the government has allowed the destruction of “sanctionary” food by any legal means.
As the Western sanctions continued, the Russian Federation also extended its response.
This measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The ban does not concern the import of goods for personal consumption of up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council of the President of the Russian Federation for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, had previously referred to the “simplely immoral” destruction of food, which he said had a negative effect on the education of people.
Moreover, Rospresnadzor launched an initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for consumption in early June.
A similar recommendation was then made to the Government by the Human Rights Council of the President of the Russian Federation.
And the vice-premier of the Russian Federation, Alexei Gordeyev, said that it was wrong to destroy food, and we have to think about how we can use it for the purposes of quality.

Chile began building a 1 billion Euro telescope
This is reported by the TASS with a reference to the European Southern observatory (ESO) press service.
This week, the European Extremely Large Telescope has officially begun to build a dome of the E-ELT, so far the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.
Its total value is estimated to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on manufacturing equipment and building an observatory.
The most expensive and complex part of the telescope is its record large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
It's a huge mirror, and it's two support surface reflections of a diameter of 4.4 and 3.75 meters, which will help E-ELT get the first detailed images of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and find the Earth's doppelgangers.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that construction of the dome has just begun, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers and other professionals for three years since the first E-ELT plans were announced.
A contract for the production of the main mirror, with a total value of about 400 million euros, was received by SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
