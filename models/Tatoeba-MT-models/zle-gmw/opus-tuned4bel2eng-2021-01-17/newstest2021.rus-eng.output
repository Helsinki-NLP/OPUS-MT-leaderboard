Semilarski v. the prosecutor's office: the former Vice-Marrier Tartu's Cassation will be examined on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The courts of the first two courts refused to hear the Semilarski case, but in April his appeal was accepted by the State Court.
The Tartu administrative court returned the complaint to the applicant on 12 December 2019, as its authorization was not within the competence of the administrative court.
The court ' s decision stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damages caused during criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor's office and the county court are responsible for regulating such matters," previously explained to ERR's correspondent for the Tartu Courts Anette Kreitsmann.
She said that Valvo Semilarski had appealed the order to the District Court, which on 5 February had not modified the decision of the Court of First Instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's lawyer, Oliver Neyes's juror, his client had been unreasonably suspected of being bribed for about two years.
He now requires the prosecutor to deny the wrong claims to him and to reimburse him for moral damages.
The reason for filing a complaint before the court was the statements made by the prosecutor for special cases of the Luuna District Procuracy, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another then Vice-Mart Artem Suvorov, was arrested on suspicion of having committed several crimes.
"Remember that, when I was arrested, the security police and the prosecutor's office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most powerful bodies in the local government, were corrupt.
These public suspicions in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these claims and suspicions have proved false, the prosecutor's office wants to say nothing about it," comments Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyes, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor should operate.
"The claim of bribes and corruption proved false, but it's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its decisions on Russia as well as on Lithuania that during the investigation stage State representatives should be careful when choosing words so that suspects would not be represented as criminals before the verdict was handed down.
To this the prosecutor's office also holds the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately has not been respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski," said Neyes.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious perpetrator and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying suspicion of bribes are still found to be unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair to the applicant”, added counsel.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former VP Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be tried on charges of bribes--the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, a former official is tried on charges of knowingly breaking anti-corruption laws in dealings of particularly large sizes.
According to the Indictment, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in town management sessions between 2015 and 2017 when making decisions concerning companies operating in Tartu, whose owners or leaders Semilarski actively interacted at the personal level during the off-the-job period.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests and therefore had to be excluded from participating in the decision-making process.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office had suspected Semilarski of taking bribes and breaking anti-corruption laws in dealings of particularly large sizes.
This occurred in October 2016, when he was arrested along with the other deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (the Centralist Party).
The prosecutor's office and the security police then stated that there was strong evidence against both vice-maryors.
Both officials then resigned.
The Suvorov case later came to trial, which fully justified the policy.
The trial of Valvo Semilarski is still under way.
The ex-Solist of the group "The Hands Up" visited the Tver region.
The ex-soldier of the group "The Hands Up," and now the solo performer, businessman and actor Sergei Zhukov posted a photograph from Kalazin Tver oblast in his official instagram account.

"Hold my hands up under the new Baby" and say hi from the drunken, fresh air!
Would you like to comment on the weather in your town?
We don't have rain today, but above and above is not rising yet."
Perhaps the singer is resting in the beautiful town of Tver region with his family.
The inhabitants of the region have already thanked the performer for his visit and have expressed their hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Children" in the post office is probably due to a new version of the old song that Kukov now recorded with the blogger and musician David Manukian (DAVA M).
And most fans stay for the old version, "Sergey, the old version of the song is definitely 1 million times better!
Support me for the devoted hands up fans, "We don't need a new baby."
Most people write directly that the original, which became a hit at the time, is more like it.

The US called upon Qatar and its neighbours to put an end to the dispute
There is a need to restore confidence and unity between Qatar and other States, as the United States Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, believes.
He said that the conflict between the Emirates and other countries in the region had lasted too long and was prejudicing regional interests in the areas of stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a dispute that Washington views as a “threat of efforts to deter Iran.”
Diplomatic relations with Qatar broke down three years ago by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They had put in place a transport ban, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, in Doha, the neighbours said that they were simply envious of Qatar's economic success -- according to the IMF, Qatar had been leading GDP per capita for a number of years.
The Emirates is the third largest natural gas exporter, the sixth largest exporter of natural gas and oil products.

How the economy will be affected by the decision of the CB to lower the core rate
The Russian bank is expected to lower the key rate again.
It dropped by an additional 0.25 percentage points, up to 4.25 percent of the annual, officially the next historical minimum.
Judging from the return of a short step of a reduction in the rate, as well as the tone of CB statements and updated forecasts of the Russian economy, the regulator is looking more optimistic about the economic prospects than ever before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy relaxation can soon stop.
"We continued to soften monetary policy, especially since there are still risks of falling inflation from 4% in 2021," reported the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvir Nabiullin.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
According to Nabiullina, economic recovery will take more than a year and a half.
However, she noted that, following the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes had recovered: energy, consumption and investment demand had recovered, the construction and production of consumer goods had increased, and the annual rate of decline in transport and production had slowed.
The CB estimates that in 2020 the economy will be reduced by 4.5 to 5.5 per cent (previously 4 to 6 per cent), while the economic recovery in 2021 will be between 3.5 and 4.5 per cent, and in 2022 it will be between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent.
In addition, the Bank of Russia adjusted the forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
The CB had previously expected US$ 27 and US$ 35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's 2020 inflation forecast was 3.7 to 4.2 per cent, compared with the previously expected 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economy is becoming more optimistic, bringing us closer to the end of the cycles of relaxation, as do economists in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, such as the Renaissance Capital, Sofia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate for over a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the CB reduced it by one percentage point because of low inflation due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate a stagnant economy due to the pandemic and its associated constraints.
The chances of monetary policy fixing remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and the end of the year), but the limit is near, accepted by the Chief Analyst Rosbanka Yevgeniy Koshelev.
The stock of inflationary risks also suggests that there is a close pause in the softening of interest policies - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to preventative measures and a faster (than expected) recovery of demand, he said.
As a result of the Bank of Russia's follow-up actions, Koshelev points out that more attention will be needed to the inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as to the external volatilism that has increased in the context of geo-politic conflicts.
In one way or another, lowering the core rate will further reduce the interest rate for the most reliable borrowers, as well as perhaps on the basis of a hypothesis, says Maxime Petrenevich, a senior analyst at the Bank of Discovery.
The rate adjustment would be less pronounced than the reduction of the core rate, he explained.
The interest rate may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage point in the second half of the year, while the interest rate on the hypothesis may end in a range of 6.2 to 7 per cent, does not rule out the BCS premiere economist Anton Poctovic.

When he recovered from what had happened, he couldn't believe it.
He tried to crawl on his knees, give me diamonds.
His lion's pride blew his head up.
He wanted it all back, and how to get it back, he didn't understand.
They have a friendly relationship, they have a common child, but he still can't come to his senses.

survey: The ruling Union of peasants and Green Lithuanians once again held party ratings
The Union of peasants and Green Lithuania, led by the Sejm government, led the party's rating.
This was shown by a poll carried out by Vilmorus Sociological Research Company on the order of a newspaper called Lietuvos rytas.

However, recently Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, in his assessment of the party's elective power, said that the Union of peasants and Greens, after this year's parliamentary elections, was likely to be able to re-establish a coalition.
This statement has caused resentment on the part of the conservators.

According to Director Vilmorus Vladace Haydes, the breakup was within the margins of error, and yet the rulers were no longer behind the conservators.

In the fall session of the plenary, the State Duma plans to consider in second reading a bill setting out the requirements for the content and composition of an application to buy, to which only small and medium-sized business entities may participate.
The Government shall amend the Act on the purchase of goods, works, services of certain types of legal persons.
The bill was drawn up in implementation of the road map for the implementation of the Strategy for Small and Medium Enterprise Development in the Russian Federation until the year 1930, which was approved by the Government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an extensive list of documents that the bidders may request from the purchasers - small and medium-sized business entities.

The requirements for the content, form, preparation and composition of the purchase request shall be determined by the bidders themselves in the purchase documents.
“The result is that the employers establish excessive requirements for the content, processing of the application, the requirement to have certificates, certificates or statements in its composition, the period of receipt of which is compatible with the time of application by the authorized authorities, resulting in the failure to participate in such purchases and a reduction in the number of participants in the purchase,” is explained in the explanation to the bill.

And we have a responsibility to create all the conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages,” remarked Vrio the governor of Irkutsk oblast Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region requested all the mayors to actively engage in the development of human settlement genetics.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All localities must have defined borders and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the Territory, for the construction of social, infrastructure and cultural sites, underlined by the head of the region.
Also during the interview, a problem was raised with the reduction of the milk intake by 30 per cent from the cooperative.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing industry of milk purchases in favour of farm-farm farms.
As a result, the share of cooperative inputs has declined.
The Head of the region has instructed the Acting Minister of Agriculture to take up the field, study the structure of milk sales, analyse the experience of other areas and identify options for solving the problem.

The authorities of Pod-Moscow reported on the fate of the closed dumps
In Moscow, solid household waste areas continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing dumps are being upgraded to modern waste management systems.
But this option is not possible for every site, and many of them have grown to a dense shelter.
Once the range is closed, it gets up on the reclamation, the body of the range is overwhelmed with soil, gas-freeing systems and infiltration.
This means that the chemical processes inside the dump can be stopped so that they do not ignite, stench, or poison soil or ground water.
And then the former dump stays standing up in a useless pile of shelter around it.
Why don't you make it useful?
For example, in Rouse, where the Annino site had just been recovered recently, the authorities were considering the option of making a slope of a pile of mines.
The site, which was used from 1976 to 2016, grew so that it went beyond the land allocated to it.
Therefore, in the reconstruction, it was necessary to buy neighbouring areas that had long been filled with rubbish.
"Some time will pass, the site's going to sit down, and the fortress will come up, and we'll think what we can do to make it useful.
A ski resort is right in the eye," told the head of the Russian district Nikolai Parthenov.
The two sites will be re-entered areas for the generation of renewable energy
The Torbeevo polygons in Lubertsa and Tymochovo in the Bogorod district will be sites for the extraction of renewable energy from waste and biological gas.
At the end of the year, a gas-pumping power plant will be launched in Torbeyev, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt hours of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalories of heat, which will provide the site with its own needs, namely, the heat supply of administrative and manufacturing facilities.
Thimochovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue as a waste-mining complex.
And at the Kuchino, a Balashina site, which was shut down following complaints from the people on the front line with the President of the country, could create a museum.
"There was this idea of creating a museum for the reconstruction of the Pod Moscow fields," reported the vice-secretary of the government, Dmitry Kurakin, the Minister of Ecology and Environment.
Israel reported a UAV crash in southern Lebanon
An unmanned Israeli army aircraft fell in southern Lebanon.
The armed forces reported that it had collapsed "in the course of operations".

According to Degtyrev, the country of Khabarov cannot now remain without a leader, so it was appointed by President Vladimir Poetin's decree to head the region so that "the remarkable building (the government of the province) would function, everything would work, the budget would be spent on social needs."
Vrio the governor explained that he had not gone to the protesters before because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
So he broadcasts on social media and reads all the comments on them.
On 25 July, two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk.
The meetings in support of the former governor have been taking place in the region since 11 July.
On the eve of another action, Michael Degtyrev announced that he would leave town on the day of the rally.
His carriage was stopped by the protesters and was called upon to speak about the fate of the arrested ex-governor of the van.

the link between the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week's regular date is 87 years from the conclusion of a pact between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
The document signed a few months after Hitler came to power was the basis on which the Holy See's relationship with the Nazis was based.
One of the drafters was Cardinal Pacelli, who six years before the Second World War became Pontifice Pius XII.

Beautiful tall minarets only decorated Aya-Sophia
Again about Aya-Sofia, there's a text about Vladimir Zelinski, which, like, needs to be protested.
First, there's a free entrance-- cheers!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but the house of God is better free than paid.
Second, Muslims won this land just as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volgo-Oqsa, the Moslem Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God help!
The Hebrews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans won America.
Are we going to return everything to everyone?
You don't think there's any Gentiles who want to get their hat back where the Pentecostal Church is?
Third, Muslims have improved the building, invested in it.
So it's just like the factories and properties that the Lenians took from the bourgeois to their property, belonging to the Lenin, and to Poetin and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything from Kremlin to Angara, so they're all right progressors.
The beautiful tall minarets very decorated Aya-Sophia, very.
It was a silly ink, and it became a silly ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “Islam” or “Order” civilisations.
There are the faithful, there are the hypocrite, and there are the pious, the uniting of faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization doesn't think.
It's the thinking of a British civil servant named Toynby, a believer who's ashamed to think like that.
And to him who believeth all over is the place of prayer.
Always.
The believer does not pray except where he is asked to go; he withdraws to another place and prays there.
He's a believer, not a defender.
We're sprouts, not tumbling rocks.

A Rwandan executor admitted that he had set fire to the Nantes Cathedral
A Rwandan citizen who worked at St. Peter and Paul's Cathedral in the French city of Nantes voluntarily confessed to burning him a week after the fire.
This is reported by France 3 on Sunday.
According to him, a man who had already been arrested on 19 July, the day after the fire, was arrested again the previous day.
On Saturday evening he appeared before the examining judge.

The current fire has not been the first time since the temple was established.
In 1972 the fire destroyed his roof.
It took 13 years to repair the effects of that fire.
The cathedral was not reopened until 1985.

Look carefully what you are buying!!!!! she shared her observations with Hope Gregoryev.
I've seen greens taken from merchants from a neighbouring foreign country and sold.
No confidence,' said Larissa Harlamov.

Alexander Dukov, President of the Russian Football Union (FRU), believes that it is not right to extend the Russian Prime League to 18 teams at the moment.
"First, it was the decision of the RPL, but I agree with it, because it's wrong to change the rules after the tournament is over.

The head of the Russian Federation of Basketball (RFB), Andrew Kirilenko, shared his memories of his games against the legendary Coby Briant and Michael Jordan in the National Basketball Association (NBA) match.
I knew that Briant's ego couldn't get hurt by any kind of cracking-up to not stimulate his sporting anger.
Coby had the killer's instinct, so on the set I tried to talk to him so he wouldn't take the game aggressively.
On the set I gave him a compliment, "Oh!
Coby, well scored, great passage!
Listening to my excited feedback, he kind of forgot to take over the ball and pick up another three or four points.
We've had a good conversation with Koby," quotes Kirilenko's words "The Evening Moscow."
He also spoke about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
The first three minutes of the match, I was running in admiration for the fact that there was a legend next to me, which I only saw on TV.
While I had the joy of breathing in my belly, Michael had scored a lot.
Soon I walked away from the trade, and a couple of times I covered his throws...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan scored 44 points anyway," added the head of the Russian Federation.
He spent 12 seasons in the NBA.

This has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor who played the father of the boy, who dressed as a woman's clothes.
