Good afternoon, excuse me, please, not a small web, and I couldn't send you any quicker.
Can you please tell me exactly where to go to the cleaning tomorrow, what's the code to the keys and about the hour tomorrow the guests are leaving, and the new guests are moving out?
Unfortunately, I have to give up your offer, because I really have found a job in the meantime.
Sorry, but I can't refuse.
Sometimes it seems to me that because of the translator, my thoughts in Czech are different from those I wrote in Ukrainian.
We promised you a surprise when you went to school.
Good afternoon, I'll take the course.
However, please indicate whether there is a time before?
Because I don't live in Prague, there might be a problem with transportation.
If there are no options, I'll still agree.
Thank you very much.
In Herson people went out again, the Russians couldn't break
As the Westers told the agency, the Shersons were able to hold a rally before they arrived to disperse the military flu and technology.
"We've had time to hold a meeting, and now there's a PF technique," said one of the participants.
Previously, the townsmen were traditionally gathered to protest at the Freedom Square -- near the ODE building and the county.
This area, like the building, is now controlled by armed Russian forces, which use weapons against protesters and steal people.
On April 3, armed Russian occupiers were reported to have used their weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Cahovca.
According to Ucrynform, in Donechen there are regular peaceful protests against a Russian agressor.
Russian military forces use force and weapons against people, are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also steal the inhabitants of the region.
President Volodymyr of the Greene gave Herson the special title "The City-Hero".
On February 24, President F. Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Will you be comfortable Monday with me going to the bank?
Good afternoon, so it would be good if you could today as you wrote at 5 p.m.

It'd be better if we had to move because we don't financially attract European prices.
I need to look at the place and try where it hurts.

Martha wasn't at school today, so I wrote to the teacher.
Hi. I'm sick, so it'll be better if we meet next weekend, I'm sorry.
I know how to cook, but I like to bake.
In Ukraine, boursch, cooks, and others are traditional.
I don't have favorite meals; I like to go through a variety of foods in different countries.
Do you like cooking?
I want to be busy.
There's a train, and there's no place
Sorry, we're a little late.
Lucia, can I go to the kitchen as an assistant?
It's very good that Julie will be able to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night.
It's very inscriptionable and convenient.
Thursday, Pablo will tell me if there'll be a job for Nazar at the brewery and when he has to come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Mariopole, the heart of war, stop fighting, we'll have weak positions
President Volodymyr of Zelenski believes that fighting for the east of Ukraine, and particularly for Mariopole, will determine the course of the war – and if the U.S.S.S.S. fails there, the Russians can abandon the talks and re-emerge the de-occupied areas.
A direct language: "Maryupol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It fights, we fight, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have a weaker position.
They (the defenders of the city, the Red.) are people who have drawn upon themselves a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariopole, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) OSV, and if they are stronger, the table of victory will be closer to us and we will have the advantage of a dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these ways, we may not be able to wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we are now depriving.
They can go for that too.
Then our win-win situation will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we note.
We believe in our result, in our victory..."
Details: Greenski also said that going to talks after the torture of Ukrainians is difficult, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
It's like, "People will take peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think any peace will satisfy them on any condition.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war must end in peace, or millions of victims will end.
And even where there's a million casualties, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight, but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for the dust when there's nothing else, there's no people."
Good afternoon, do you have any more space for a Czech course for adults from 7 a.m. to Tuesday?

As a result of the change in Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality state.
This is the analysis of the metaphorical scope of Ukrainian literature, the status study.

Monday we'll have leadership and we'll decide how and when we'll spend
Good, because I've already started to worry that I've misunderstood something and been wrong.
I think it's the right thing to do, it's better to do less, and it's better to do the right thing for these people than for a lot of people.

The Department of Defence of Ukraine's main intelligence department has published a list of Russian military officials who have been involved in military crimes in the Kucha district of Kyiv.
According to Ucrynform, this is reported by the Department of Defence of Ukraine in Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian must know their names!
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine has acquired a list of military officers from 64 separate mobile gun brigades directly involved in the commission of military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Butch, a report is being submitted.
The MOU GUR notes that for crimes committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and brought to justice.
You can view the list by reference.
As Ucrynform reported, Irpin, Bocha, Gotthomel and the entire region of Kyiv were freed from Russian invaders.
In liberated towns and villages there are massive murders of Russian military civilians.
On April 1, the city head of Bouchi, Anatoly Fedorook, reported that 280 people had been buried in brotherly graves.
On April 3, the prosecutor-general of Irina Wiendiktwa said that 410 bodies of killed civilians had been removed from the Russian invaders in the Kyiv region.
On February 24, the Russian president, the leader of the road, announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian invaders are firing and destroying key infrastructure, firing massive rounds of residential areas of Ukrainian towns and villages using artillery, rocket-propelled rockets, rockets and air bombs.

I thought after a week, but we're getting hot, sirens.
Tomorrow might be a bad connection on the road.
I'm grateful to everyone for their experience, even if they're painful.
I think I've learned from each situation for myself to avoid repeating mistakes in the future.
The Directives take the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of the Rules.
I'm sure it won't be a problem.

We promised you a surprise when you went to school.
Bolob is great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the neighborhood doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
Photographs of people who have been shot and shot have puzzled the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other, how could that have happened in the 21st century?
And I'm not surprised at anything, and it's exactly what I was waiting for.
I picked up children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girl-boys with the kids, and then he went back to the capital to work.
Since 2014 I have consistently assisted the USG, and I have never doubted that, in the case of the occupation, my family will be spared.
Because he was, and I remain absolutely sure, that the essence of the rotting Communo-CDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it just can't exist; it's built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in Gitomire prison.
A few years ago, in the U.S.S.A., a copy of the original shoot-out case was made available: the whole matter is over a hundred pages, and the sentence of execution is very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was unwritten, denied the charge.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was a free man, a poor single courtean, never went to the fortresses.
The fact that they lived on courtyards and had several cows was enough to condemn the farmer and the nurse of young children to death.
My parents didn't even know where they were buried.
My grandmother said that nearly a hundred people were then taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the core case, there's the name of the scissor.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informer.
The apple from the apple is not far from falling, as is known...
The shooting three who had ordered the villagers to be killed were ethnic Russians.
In analyzing the case, he was interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia, like "The Endless Barack," which resembles the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NEC have found ways to punish and kill almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 to 80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalin's protests and publicly wrote the names of the murderers — the system first compromised and then destroyed them.
It's like a computer found files with child pornography, and they put them in prison, and they died there quickly.
The KGB is still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about crimes of the past century.
Then why suddenly are you surprised at their actions now?!
It concentrates on the most repugnant human nature.
On the surface of a thousand-year Ordinary tradition, enslaved and imperial chauvinism began in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then they did an animal genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligence during a few waves of red terror.
Look at the 1992 half-French film "Cheqist," and that's what happened.
Zo you've seen my photos in my bathing suit
You can ask your wife what I can buy from the cough.
Sorry, I don't have anybody to ask.
I also wanted to ask you maybe you know where the kids went, because Galia couldn't know them.
Sweetheart, Igor asks if you are comfortable driving tomorrow? (It's out and can go because the car hasn't looked at the station yet.)
It's very uncomfortable for us to bother you so much.
You're very helpful, thank you!

According to "European Truth," Welt writes about this with a reference to sources in government circles in Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding offer was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 goubits, including education and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also offered by the 1.2 billion Euro in the version of the Boxer APC.
While tanks have to rise relatively close to the targets of the enemy, Panzerhabite 2000 can lead fire more than 30 miles away.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles, citing KMW's offer, the supply of self-sustaining goubles will follow a circular scheme.
The Boonesevere will give Kiev 100 of its hubites in the shortest term, and the gaps that have been created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new Hawaiian can be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, i.e. before the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed by 2027.
Is this the first half of the day, or the second half of the day together?
Thank you.

Make you happy.
I don't know, love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I think we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say that after the war there'll be a lot of work.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.

And I'm not talking about myself.
How are you feeling today?
Hi, sorry, I just woke up, didn't sleep well.
Sorry to bother you.
I was disappointed that we had a bad start yesterday with the Cola.
I'll ask whether Gregory Denisenka or Jonah's might) to be helped at least a little bit with mathematics.
Maybe there's something I can do for them too.
If that's possible, I want to raise mathematical terms in the weekend.
Geometry is difficult at all, but we have to work with the wheel so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for your Test Jobs
We hope so too.
And so she's very pleased with any gift
Yab wanted to connect to her Czech number
Last night at 402 buses I met a Ukrainian woman named Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay out of it.
Now we've arranged to be friends.
And yesterday evening I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine to have felt my heart.

No, I'm just a human being.
So she wouldn't be frightened that no one came
It's the most important thing you've taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babyn Yar Holocaust Center in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Hebrews in Babin Yaru.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of State, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in the region, peaceful and secure Europe.
This foundation we must defend is also part of our responsibility to our history."
If "the evils of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!
Fight must last."
Today Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the inhabitants of its blocked cities and lets them die of diseases.
Russian troops have fired large-scale shots at the Ukrainians, even visibly similar to those fired at the Bunny Yar.
For over a month, the Germans have seen it in real-time news.
Yes, Germany introduces sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, and weapons that have not been imaginable for a long time.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy arms required by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to stand up to the swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and beasts.
There is no easy way without risk and sacrifice to defeat evil and stop the abuses that take place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, agree for a tour, and write when to be gathered
All were sick only Lidia wasn't sick they had omicron a new kind of fruit
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
That's the ticket I'm using instead of the car.
Warn for the lateness of the documents.
The ticket cost me 2,000 guineas at the leader
Sergei Sidorenko: Our joining the North Atlantic has ceased to be a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian social science showed that 67 percent of the Ukrainians were against joining the North Atlantic, and only 18 percent of those surveyed were in favour.
After the Revolution of Greed, the flight of Victor Yanukowitsch, the Anexia of Krim, and the beginning of the Donbasi war, the number of opponents of the North Atlantic has begun to fall, and the number of opponents has instead increased.
Since the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian socialists have recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – over 75 percent.
Despite the support of Ukraine's accession to NATO and the help it provides in the context of war, there is now much criticism of the alliance and the country's members – for the untimely provision of weapons, for refusing to close the sky, for wanting to "freak" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its desire to join the alliance through the Russian Federation if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will be given secure guarantees, including military guarantees.
In the new episode of the "Fucking Question" podcast, together with the editor of the "European truth" talk about how the Union has helped Ukraine since the moment of the Russian invasion, for which it should be criticized, and for which the Union is criticized in vain, why our prospects for joining the North Atlantic are as close as ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed in the battles with Russia can become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here
I have a volt partner that my application is under consideration.
I gave it to you through this mobile plugin
We don't have a visa, we have to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was processed in Poland, where we didn't get a visa, but we gave a pestel.
We'll send you a letter!
I had to go to Denis today in a good mood.
I made arrangements with a boy from Ukraine who I met yesterday to meet outside the school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
For so I don't love, I'm not enough for a long time.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic sent T-72 tanks and combat cars to Ukraine.
I'm leaving the kids alone waiting there for three or four years, and I'm going home because I can't leave them anymore.
And we'll go with us for six to seven in the morning.
Yes, there was a heart condition.
I had a good feeling about this man, but he didn't do very well and I left him.
After a while he came back and asked me to forgive him.
I refused him.
After a while, he called and said that he had had a heart operation.
I asked him to just sleep with me, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported it for almost half a year.
During that time, we had a lot of communication.
I had problems at work in a parallel way.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at it differently.
And he offered me to marry, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God himself determined our fate.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only speaks Czech
I wanted to tell you that I've managed to find a place to live, and I'm very happy that I have a place to live and a place to be with the baby.

Just write a sentence you don't understand.
I'm aware that the translator doesn't always translate the text properly.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor about whether or not she's supposed to give the paper.

God never gets late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:)
I'm perfectly aware of the value of malpractice and I understand that the kind of work I had at home in Kiev I won't be able to have and the money I've earned at home I won't get here either.
But just sit there and do nothing, I can't do anything, because then all the bad thoughts in your head are stuck so you have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are processed from 7 a.m. to 7 a.m., and then you can just wait.
The Lord came back at 4 a.m.
So we took them with us.
We slept with Vica in the kitchen, they were put in the bedroom.

It's better that we sometimes change the changes?
I'm sorry, I don't really have any missed calls in the middle.
I offer jobs, cleaning the bathroom and the toilet, washing three windows, dust cleaning.

One mother said she'd cook doughnuts for the kids.
He comes to you at the guests
Please tell me, do you have at least an approximate schedule for cleaning your apartments a month ahead, even for a reasonable understanding of what days?
I won't remember any of this.)
The Russian army is threatening to launch rocket attacks on Kiev, saying, "No such things have ever been done before."
Conashenko's direct language is, "We're trying to disrupt and target Ukrainian forces against objects in the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, Russian military forces will strike decision centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously been deterred."
The Russians had launched rocket attacks on Kiev since the first days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian occupation forces.
On February 25, the remnants of Russian rockets that hit the U.K. POP system fell on a apartment building in the late afternoons.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a large surface on the Valery Lobanovskiy Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians were involved in a cart on the Roadway near Babinna Yaroua, killing five passers-by.
On March 2, U.S. A.P. systems blew up Russian rockets flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence building over the South Railway Station.
March 14th, the wreckage of an invader rocket broke down a building and a trollbus in Kurenovc in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a living mass on the Vineyard, killing one person, and injuring another 19 people, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets destroyed the modern RTR Retroville on the Vineyard, killing at least four people.
Mer Kiev Vitalia Clique announced on April 13, that the inhabitants of the capital, who were moving out of the city, had yet to return early.
The military explained to the local authorities that Russians could still launch rockets at Kiev and that there were a great deal of mines and unexploded weapons in the vicinity of the capital.
The Department of Defence of Ukraine's main intelligence agency warned on April 12 that Russians were planning a series of attacks in the Russian Federation to blame the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civil population.
On April 1, a naphtobase exploded near Bielgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helipopters.
Early in April, the local government of Bielgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian rocket" had fallen near the city.
Evidently, both the elites in Washington and Berlin are thrown into cold sweat from the very idea that the Nazis will kill Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Greenski doesn't talk to them as much as to their choices and communities in general.
By speaking in Parliament and before thousands of crowds on the major cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his followers have been able to access.
Green doesn't convince European politicians to do anything for Ukraine; it convinces European nations that choose politicians.
And these talks, this delicate alloy of power, the touchingness and sometimes despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically opposed to closing the sky, 70 percent of its citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against the speeding up of Ukraine's introduction, this process is already under way.
I understand you, so you don't want us to be considered cheating.
The things you collect are better to give to people who need it more.
I can come to you and we'll decide where I'm going.

Are you sure you don't want this?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they have for it.

You call at work, find out if you want to go to work today or not.
Children decide to stay at home.
As long as something becomes clear.
There's hope... it won't take long.
Now... make a deal... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where do you want to go?
I've got $50 in my pocket.
Many of our employers have not paid their wages on our jobs.
Where should I go? Who needs me? How should I provide for my children? Where should I live?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything from the house... you drive 1,000 miles.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.

If so, what kind of species is it?

Today we have joy--our city of Butch was freed from the occupiers, and our wars survived.
The enemy is being purged, looking for Russians in their cellars and apartments.
The whole town has been replaced, and the change work will begin.
And Ivan would see if there was something that needed repair or something else to do.

These are small businesses that have opened their offices and shops by volunteering.
These are the tractors who are actually going to the field under fire, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree to go to humcons today to temporarily occupied areas in order to get help and get people out of there.
These are heroic leaders, who are afraid to go into the combat zone, calm and help refugees in the wagons, and at peaceful stations help volunteers to load a humanitarian into the wagons.
These are the gas stations who were standing on the Gitomiran Tray during the early days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
They're communists who shoot up garbage, repair pipes, and power lines to provide people with the necessary services.
They're doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and at the free minute they're still volunteering to pick up the medicine cabinets on the front.
We're in Ukraine, we're out of juice when we have little leaves)
Please tell me the little kids-- what age do you mean?
My daughter is 8 years old, is that age accepted?
I'm looking for a home for my daughter and me for three or four days every day to come to Czech Republic and hand over passports for a visa to Canada.
There are a lot of people in Warsaw in the Visa Center and there's no on-line queue.
I wanted to come one day, but it's far, it's taking a long time on the train, it's going to be hard for the kid.
So I decided to look for a home in or near Prague.
No, we're fine.

Grisko is still asleep, at night very crying, licking his teeth.
I'm on the phone right now with everyone I know from Lvov, and a lot of people died.
The Czech Republic began issuing a visa after March 22nd, according to me.
By that time, they had put stamps like this and then compared these stamps to a carriage.
Ukraine's Occidental Voting District (Ukrainian State) is an election district that unites the elections located outside Ukraine and consists of voting rooms at Ukrainian Embassies and Consulates and military bases located abroad, [vinoc 1] where the Ukrainian peace-keeping forces (Cosovo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) are located.[1] The role of the District Election Commission for the Concord Election District is carried out by the Central Election Commission.
In the foreign election district, there are only popular votes: the election of President and People's MPs and universal referendums.
Local elections are not held.
They're at the train station near the mother and child's room.

Are you angry with me?
I'll get a picture in my bathing suit.
I don't need any more money. I borrowed a long term from a friend.
I wanted to say that I've already connected a Czech mobile number.
So I didn't need another device, so I went to O2 and they made me an electronic SIM card, which I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
I'm very uncomfortable, Sunday works and I can't anymore.
You said you had a broken washing machine, take it for yourself, and you need it too.
We don't have enough carpets, swollen carpets, plates. The kids don't have pyjamas, and they don't have anything to move into.
Good morning, I'll be leaving at 10 o'clock... write again the address, there's a missing text.
I don't want to torment you, I don't want to torture myself, I'll somehow kill myself.
So it would be nice, but I know there were no free places, and basically they've got all the lessons right now and they're teaching pretty nicely.

Did your mom say something hurt you yesterday?
She can't tell them what she wants, and she doesn't understand what they're saying.
I went to school today too.
I saw Kristina's mom today, but she didn't even say hi (
Very tasty apples, what kind of species is that?
The head of the office of President Andreas Yermack informed us that Russia is beginning a "feasible operation" on the weapons that the allies are handing over to us.
The direct language of Jermocus is, "They understand that they lose war, they see their backwardness, and they want to beat up the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last faucets is the virtual destruction of the U.S.S.S.S. 300.
This information has already been simplified by the Prime Minister, Eduard Heger.
We know Russian scripts, name one of them.
They can launch fairy tales that Ukrainian soldiers seem to have weapons from allies, and they're massively moving on to arming the Russian army.
I want to warn you right away.
For the weapons in the hands of the U.S.S. soldiers only send the enemy to that world.
I beg your pardon, have forgotten to ask how much a beer costs a garden in the month and will it work in the summer?

I'm watching the ad a lot already taken. Now it's hard for us to do that.
Sorry, I didn't get the whole point.
Couldn't you call today because of the change in the rate of the mobile operator?
Sorry, but I can't count on anybody in this life.
Today I was offered a job for every day.
I'm sorry, but I let you work there already.
Thank you for responding and wishing you a good help.
Perhaps your father told us that there are witnesses of Jehovah among us, but I do not believe in any religion.
However, she was baptised in the church.
I respect all faiths based on love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, began reading the Torah.
I think there are no middlemen between man and God.
You can also think about not putting the fridge at the door of the boys' room.
Thank you very much. You really helped me.
We're looking for a hunter for the usual cleaning of the house here in the village.

You can use this online broadcast from Ukrainian to Ukrainian and vice versa.
Whatever, we're four on one bed in a room where you can't even afford it, thank you very much.
Well, did you click the references I sent you above?
On each of them you have a free offer of shelter, a description, a contact with the owner and a photograph.
I can't find any contact but an email, I wish there was nothing in me that lived closer to the Czech Krumlove we have a job in Chechen Krumlov and now we live in Prague.
Then I won't help you.
Thank you for helping us out, we've found the dwelling, but we need a bed and a couch may suggest where you can buy at a price, for we have a weak budget, thank you very much.
Can't say what's bad and often hurts stomach too?
I saw your publication on the Music Project.
I'm a choremaster at the Dragoman National University of Education.
I'll be glad to work together.

We cleaned up the whole room and moved to the second room.
The international community continues to express shock and resentment after the emergence of evidence that Russian forces have committed abuses against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as a “provocation.”
"Reports of killed, raped and seriously wounded Russian soldiers of peaceful Ukrainians are worthy of conviction," declared the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jasinda Ardern, to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that its government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its struggle against Russian invasion.
The Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Quisida, called the incidents a “violation of international law”.
There were reports that hundreds of peaceful inhabitants had been shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left on the streets in the outskirts of Kiev, in Boechi, by Russian soldiers who had left the area after occupation for a few weeks.
Photographs showing the bodies of the killed civilians with their tied hands shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
French President Immanuel Macron announced to the radio interview on April 4th that there were signs that Russian troops had committed “war crimes” in Butchi.
"What happened in Butch requires a new round of sanctions and very clear steps," said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed at Russian coal and oil export.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez, said that Russian troops could go so far that they had committed a “genocide” in Butch.
"We'll make sure that those who committed these war crimes don't get away with it," said Sánchez in Madrid.
In her speech on government television late on April 3, Russia's MSS spokesperson, Mary Zacharov, dismissed the charge as a "provocation."
She said without evidence that the United States and the North Atlantic had ordered an image to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minute after the material appeared does not raise any doubt as to who ordered the story," said Zechariah.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defence had also argued without evidence that the Bouchi image was “a further order of the Kiwi regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called the "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Butch.
On April 4, Russia's follow-up committee published a statement in which it announced a “investigation” on the charge that Ukraine was spreading “knownly false information” about Russian military actions in Butch.
The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Greenski, spoke on April 3, accusing the Russian military of forming a “genocide” in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they should come to Butchi to see what their military forces had done.
"I want all leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being executed," said Greenski in a video clip, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting at the police," he said.
He said that Russian President Volodymyr Putin and Russian military officers should be responsible for the military operations in Ukraine.
"When we find people bound behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of the victims scattered in the streets of Butchi, a city about 35 miles northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a reporter from the Ukrainian Service Radio Freedom saw on the streets a small town of bodies as if they were civilians.
In only one place did the reporter see up to 10 bodies on the street.
The AP journalists have seen at least 21 bodies in various places in Butchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people -- all of them civilians -- were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to the locals, was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims seemed to have been killed from a close distance.
Generally, the Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 peaceful inhabitants had been found in the district of Kiev, which had been controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, it's all there, we bought it from the list.
"They've been told there's no Kiev."
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by fearful things, such as robbery, rape, murder, and torture.
There is another point in this list about which there is now much less information: the removal of the local population to the enemy's area.
About March, Russian occupiers “evacuate” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied localities into their area and within the area of Belarus, which President Lukashenko himself actually gave to the Russian military police.
"Ukrainian Truth" found the exiled Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text have been forced to voluntarily extract outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from despair.
Fortunately, they live and maintain contact with their relatives.
However, in view of the claims made by Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So in Melitopole, the Russians stole the staff of the second shelter, took the children out of there without their parents, including the 12-year-old Miroslava, daughter of the lost Ukrainian champion from the voyage of Joseph Zaczepinski.
Alexander's family, Marina and their ten-year-old daughter, Wally moved to Guestomell a few months before the war.
Alexander was the one who got a job at the Antonov airport, which is two and a half miles from the village.
The family settled in a military town, although it was a civil.
As true plastics, Denis and Marina had collected their alarmed carts in advance, but the morning of February 24, they couldn't escape.
They didn't have their car, and they didn't take any bus anymore.
About 12 o'clock in the afternoon of February 24th, they saw a helicopter with a Latin letter V followed by the first rockets.
One of them got into the next house.
The family then went down to the cellar and remained there for three long weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 persons were hidden in their cellar.
Not all of them decided.
"On the 6th evening of February 24th, people came into the driveway, speaking both non-Russian and non-Russian.
They say, "Who's there?" --I say so. --"Get out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the cellar, if there were any weapons.
All the men were asked if they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We've come to defend you for the instructions of Ramzan Cadyrov."
It was the Chechen OMON, not even the military, the young boys from 25 to 35 years old.
They said, "We've had the help of the Ukrainians in the war, Sasko White (commanded the nationalist UNA-UNOS movement Viking, which fought on the Chechen side of the first Russian-Chetsian war, UP), and now we've come to help you."
On the third day they asked us what was missing.
We say that the water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke up the store, took the goods from there under the charge of "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us six bottles.
There are videos online where kids thank the Cadder for their food.
So they're the ones who, after the shop robbery, brought the carpet and said, "We know it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatowicz."
No one particularly wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid there says, "You have seven days to hand over our phones," they laughed.
They have also constantly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said it's a good thing they came because they didn't want war, because the Ukrainians are backed up, and they're good at it, and they say, "Putin is an ass, Cadour too, but there's nothing we can do, because our families are there."
And mostly, they didn't fight, they used to rob shops, they were pillaging.
The chicken was put on, the one was tied to one leg by a georgian tape, and the other by his white scotch and called it a "milly."
They didn't come to Ukraine prepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence was working... when they were beaten in Butchie, so they didn't even take the dead away, they said, "Do you have an artery?"
Moreover, we had corrupted lines — Chechens didn't know each other, and in the early days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were a stranger or not.
We had them by March 13th, followed by a Russian OMON, followed by an Omian trooper.
They put 30-40 units of technology between the houses -- ours were constantly falling into it from the Bayrackards.
But these came and told us that the VMS is gone, but there's "Azz," and they say, "Aqsa" is so thousands of hundred in Ukraine.
By calling "Kieve has already given up" it's been going on since early March.
One day a Russian came to us, either an officer at the station or a representative of the FSB, saying there would be an escape.
And we were listening to the radio -- it was about the Beech, the Gotthomel, and we thought maybe we'd get a green corridor.
From the beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being transported to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
And they said, "Well, you have to feel bad for your kids!"
As it worked, they pushed us into the cellar and started shooting from under the house, or the Gradients, or the Minometes.
And then it flew back... and the houses in the neighborhood just burned, and some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct engagement on the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border and the Red Cross.
Part didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the country--they said, "You're shot there, you're sold to organs."
We were taken through the Chernobylbyl, and the road was burned on both sides, and the technology was broken, although the Belarusians told us that Russians were moving to them immediately.
A lot of caponire, buried technology and soldiers.
At the Belarusian outlet of the "Moma" we went through improvised controls, many were without any documents because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, and we were given tea.
And here we hear the shots! the rocket shoots, and you can see -- it's the Iskander that was working on Kiev.
Though they from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these planes fly, they turn on the borders."
But we're from the air, we have education, we know what this is.
Then we got loaded on the bus and taken to the Chonkey sanatorium near Gomel.
His headman, Hungarian Basil Stepanowicz, came, said, "Here, I've been forked, I've been from the Black.
But I understand that Poetin and Lukashenk won't stop till these thieves get hit.
The poor people are suffering!
And we've got Lukashenko so good!
He'll say as he says."
They offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium said to us, "You're already a traitor!"
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least so called) were spreading misinformation that men in Poland could not go.
Many believed it and feared to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents -- our daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and the war broke out on Thursday.
At the U.K. Consulate, we received no help, and at the station in Minsk, we were told that without passports no one would get on the bus.
Let me tell you, we've had a lot of help from Belarusian volunteers.
So we were placed in Minsko, and we were accompanied.
In the sanatorium, no force was held.
Our second group of migrating representatives said that you could live here for a maximum of a week, because Belarus is not Europe; there's no payment here.
We found an internal transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we drove near Mozír (about 50 miles from the Ukrainian border to the U.S.), we saw rocket launches in Ukraine: the rocket first flew, the rocket lighted beautifully, and then the rocket went smoothly.
People who boarded a bus in Mozíri said that Russians were constantly shooting with polygons.
But I can say that Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
The generals are being released from the army.
One woman told us she would break something to her son if he was invited.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsko is located, is not believed at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
It is not accepted that their polygons are used to shoot at Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we're registering, and we're going to decide what we're going to do.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now, of course, as much Estonian flags."
Marina lived in a military town in Guestomalie with the family of her brother, his wife and two children, who were 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary items and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the cellar of the neighbouring house.
Marina herself couldn't go home, and she couldn't, in principle, do not have a house anymore.
No one really knew anything about evacuating.
Can't you go downtown on Monday?
Thank you, we've got everything. And we've always been waiting for you.
Thank you for your engagement, the towers are beautiful
And in this little apartment there's no whiffing, mostly all your questions are answered by me, and now I don't know what to do, and the kids on Monday are online, and the internet isn't there.
So I'm going to live with two Ukrainian women and their children, or is this a family that's ready to accept us?

Can we agree on how best to do this?
On April 1, the city head of Bouchi, Anatoly Fedorook, announced a joyful message that the Ukrainian military released the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day the occupiers were thrown out of the entire district of Kyiv.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would have felt at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it was also known that at least 280 peaceful inhabitants had been shot by Russians alone.
They were killed just in the street, some were tied up and shot in the hole, some were killed -- teenagers.
Killed and tortured the village head of Motijin Olgo Suchenko, her husband Igor, and Alexander's son, who were kidnapped on March 23th.
Olga and Alexander were in a brotherly grave, and Igor were in a sewer.
Both sides of the trail 20 miles from Kiev found the bodies of several stripped women wrapped in a carpet.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr of Zelenski said that certain types of weaponry provided by Western partners had arrived too late.
He spoke about it in an interview with the Associated Press, published by the Office of the President, writing "European Truth."
"All the equipment, all they're sending, for some sort of equipment it's done late.
So what, when we talk, for example, about Mariopole, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From leaders in some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the value of these changes," said Greenie.
On the question of whether it was enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the President said, "No, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine was a member of the North Atlantic Organization, there would be no war, or it would look different.
"It would otherwise open, we would have the shoulders of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But confident that there would still be no war," he added.
Remember, the Great Britain's premier promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armour and anti-ship weapons.

He was a very rich man, and after a while he called and reported that he had had a heart operation.
Asked me just to sleep with him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought I might be his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me a suggestion.
"There was a car standing in my yard, like a crocodile, and she let loose the mountains.
And they kept me in the house, and then they took me to the cellar, and there were a lot of people, about 400 people, and there was nothing to breathe.
And what about the living that you've been dropping pictures
I haven't really got there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already simplified this phenomenon.
The last two videos will see when the Internet will work properly
Is there a dress code on the job, or can you walk in what you have?
All right, he'll come over there and pick them up.
I don't want anything
I realize I can't sit with you. I have to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or Ukrainian television at all.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a pro-voice, propaganda channel, not at all interesting to me.
What happened there at the stop with the man that the police came by quickly?
Diana didn't answer me, and you didn't.
All right, I just need to print pictures for the kids, so it'll be okay.
But perhaps you need a more detailed knowledge of Czech.
I'm worried you should be satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who's a Ukrainian, but she's studying in the Czech Republic for a special tourist.
You really don't want to come home with the kids for a moment, calmly and with your grandmother.
I want you to be with me, wake up next to you.
In general, it takes a lot of trouble in a foreign country, and every day they want to go home.
Mrs. Agatha, if you want this picture, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make us live here as much as possible.
I'll remember you for the rest of my life.
And, I'll remember and smile at it.
So thank you very much Ania's still preparation of the route in the geolocation in the phone so that we can get there faster.
I have to pay the fare, I have to control.
How can I see how much we use?
How am I supposed to pay?
"I tell her that the "renovation of the TV and the radio receiver" took a long time because of the import details, and friends and acquaintances were warned not to be overwhelmed when the phone was called."
"For a whole month we hide from the infu mother-in-law of war.
So far, it's working.
However, in the Puzzle (Customs - UP) the fur froze on both the back and the back of the paws, which may be due to stress, a change in feed, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are removed, and the stress doesn't depend on me, unfortunately.
The bottle is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions, unlike the mother-in-law."
Because of Olga's poor hearing and spending most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law spent the month living in an apartment with her "incognito."
And April 1st, 93-year-old Oksana Polov took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days I lived with her as a partisan in the apartment.
Both the war and the fact that I was next to her were concealed, and they were technically coming as usual for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the reception -- she listened for four hours, then sang for two hours."
The radio receiver was always near the bed.
My mother - in - law spends most of her time in her room.
It's bad, it's made me invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "gadgets," I hid in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the TV.
And then I called everyone who was in touch with her, and that's 6 to 7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It's April 17th -- I've got two apartments cleaning:)
Good evening, I didn't think about it at all:)
Hi, if we need our help tomorrow, we can come.
Do you have to order dinner, do you want to take dinner from the house? Do you want to print it out, or do you want to print it and I'll sign it?

I understand you and I'm not complaining, but in my situation I'll be looking here for a while.
I'm telling you, the Embassa is a bit here,
The British who defended Mariopole in the U.S. state that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The British, who is a military officer of the U.K. Navy Marines team, who is involved in the defence of Mariopole, told his friends and family that they would form arms and surrender to Russian occupations.
Source: Twitter page of Aidin Aislin, a British member of the USB, who has served in the lava since 2018, Air Force, citing members of the family and friends of Islein, Atlas News, referring to the words of a friend of Aislin, who spoke to him
Twitter Aislin said, "We received a message from him, "It took 48 days, we tried everything we could to protect Mariopole, but we have no choice but to enslave Russian soldiers.
We don't have any food or equipment left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will soon end."
Details: Aislein served in the 36th separate U.S. Marine Team, which is participating in the Mariopole Defence Operation.
The Air Force Journals contacted the mother of the military official En Wood, and she confirmed that her son had announced on the phone that they were planning to go prisoner.
The second military officer, Brennan Philips, also confirmed to journalists that in the last telephone conversation Icelyn had talked about the plans of their capitulation subdivision.
According to him, the crew ran out of supplies and food.
Atlas News magazines contacted a friend of his who said that Iceland's division intended to surrender itself to Russian subdivisions in order not to get caught without weapons and bullets in the hands of the so-called “cadavers”.
Sociologists also used audio recordings of a telephone conversation at which Aislin seemed to be talking to a friend of her acquaintance, an American, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Aislin said that they were trying to get out of town in civil clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British told him that he was threatened at Instagram by a private military company called Wagner.
Aisleen was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight against the so-called "Islam State" terrorists in Syria.
In 2018 he officially joined the USG lava and sworn in.
Aislin's friends and close friends called Johnny, and in social media he's more famous under the name Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know if we're together or not.
But it won't be easy, you'll have to find it...
You offered to come with you, I agreed if everything was okay.
Thank you, before you need to, you've done so much for us, we're very grateful to you.
If you don't ever want to write to me, I'll wait
Hello Natali, please pour the flowers outside, by the front door.
I'd like to learn Czech too.
I'd like you to have at least a little rest and think about yourself.
Today you must wear facial cream)
Yeah... thank you very much. I didn't even expect to see such a man, health and luck!!!!
Little Duchess isn't ashamed anymore?
Ondrej and his father came to visit us.
No one else came in, although there were many strollers on the street.
We're home today.
The kids have learned lessons, they're playing now.
I have to go to Lydle for food after dinner.
You have me.
You know I love you.
I'll do anything for you.
How can I prove that love?
I want a chance for us to be together.
To prove it to you.
You may have had many disappointments.
Let me make you happy
Grandmother won't be able to, her legs are very painful and cross(()
How much does it cost to rent a flat in Prague?
Will all parents come?
The climate is almost the same.
The family is fine, I have my mother, three brothers and a husband left.
One brother in the war in Mariopole, the other in Zaporizha, and a man from Kiev today were transferred to Harkow.
Phone calls every day say everything's okay, and there's someone who knows him, they won't tell the truth yet.
I wanted to see you, but I wanted to do some sort of thing.
I'll ask the man in the morning if he can make it tomorrow.
When you come home, write to me, please, I would need to communicate with Daniel.
Assailants who lost their lives in the fight played a full role.
Shot by teacher Dmitr Paulisky, his unknown cousin, young Boris Alexander.
Their bodies have been thrown into “the deep dung pit which has been buried by the earth”.
Behind the memory "there was some dead silence in the city."
Severely one of the inhabitants ran from house to house.
On the streets, bodies rolled by Bolsheviks were always encountered
And I might actually follow you, I need you, I can't without you.
3. What kind of activity would your own/involve would help you or your friends to adjust better to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won't, because the railroad reconstruction is closed.
Go to the bridge where the reconstruction is, tell me you're up and I'll come to you

If I correctly understood us from school they'll send us an entry letter to speak the menu
Well, we'll try to get us on Tuesday to social services.
Then, when the fill is cold and the plate comes up, the blind cakes and roost them on a small fire on the oil.
Okay, I'm sure I'll ask him.
As soon as we get set up tomorrow night, I'll pick it up on Tuesday.
I want to be able to repay all those who have helped us, for this was the last hope, indeed.
I'm not afraid of robots, as I lived in the village too, so I can and I like to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition you have, we have this for Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved the 7176 law-promoting facility, which is called "To advance the monitoring of potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economy."
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economy has turned out to be the place where members of the Watching Board of Tenders and Banks attend.
Initiators believe that making decisions by the Board of Monitors of the Superintendency in conditional Kiev can somehow solve Ukraine's national security problems.
We know that there are a lot of new threats to the host companies, but we don't know yet about any company that has become required to physically attend the Watchdog Board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is a wonderful basis for taking all the gains from the difficult reform of post-revolution institutions, including independent monitoring of the board, and then setting up manual controls.
It's like it was before 2015.
Why should companies keep watch over the board, and who should join them?
And what's more, if under patriotic spells there's one dangerous law protagonist going on, there's another thing that's going to blow up tomorrow, for example, government purchases through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
There's a lot to be written off for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the legal object of 7176.
So on February 22nd, this rule was added to the comparative table of subject 5397.
In general, the desire to dissuade the board in one way or another has been circulating among some popular candidates for a long time.
Not for criticism as such, but to show the possible effects of a legal instrument, we will consider the arguments that explained the need to accept it.
And then we'll give you our suggestions on how to solve the issue of managing institutions during the war.
The first assistant of the Minister of Economics, Denis Kudin, explained the need for such innovation with the risk of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would prevent remote work by the Board of Visitors.
In other words, the risk is that the Board of Visitors will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may cause the company's work to be paralyzed.
We agree that such a risk is, but will it prevent members of the Watch Tower Board from moving to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation in which independent members of the board (which form the majority of all the members of the board) put their personal security above the company's interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
Then, according to the law, they can be released.
And then, rather than anything else, it's going to result in the loss of the cohort, the necessary observational joy to make any decisions.
Rather, it will not work quickly to appoint new independent members of the Board of Monitors, since the law provides for a competitive selection that lasts an average of 3 to 4 months.
Hence, the 7176 law - provoking decision is likely not to prevent the government from losing the ability to make a decision, but rather will lead to it!
The People's MP, the author of Dmitro Natalia's law-promoting body, provides other arguments to support it.
In particular, he notes that "many businesses, such as the Defence-Industrial Complex (PPC), are now in need of repositioning" and that "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna on Zoom discuss addresses and other sensational information."
For starters, there are hardly any PKK institutions in Ukraine that have oversight of the board.
The Board of Monitors is not in the Ucropronprom, which actually manages almost all the OPC institutions.
But even in Ucropronprom, according to the law, the board has quite limited powers, and all its members carry out duties that are not free of charge.
The entire power in Ucro-Bornochrome belongs to the Director General, who will actually decide whether or not to re-establish a company that belongs to the firm.
Moreover, such an argument does not stand out for criticism, either, because the 7176 bill does not make any changes to the law that governs the operation of the PKK institutions.
Mr. Dmitro, on his Facebook page, also uses arguments that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments generally do not have anything to do with improving the efficiency of the operations of the companies and the banks, but let's try to consider some of them: "a respected foreign experts at the first word of war," leaving Ukraine in 2021, but remain members of the Watchdog Board in Ukraine's public institutions, with a full salary of several hundred thousand dollars, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from war."
First, it's a manipulation -- most such board members have never lived in Ukraine and have only come here periodically.
So to say they're leaving Ukraine, to say the least, it's not fair.
Second, as a result of the Coronarius Pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian board members have long been engaged in online sessions.
It's a long-standing tool in world practice, and it's in very different fields: business, education, medicine, etc.
Also, we should not forget that being a member of the board is not a full-time job.
They usually have other things to do, and that's what electronics help them do.
Third, all these claims are read as claims only to aliens.
I wonder why Mr. Dmitro does not express identical claims to members of the Watch Tower Board who are Ukrainians?
Because they're not behind their companies either.
By the way, it's not the first populist attempt to get aliens out of the Watching Board, and war is just a new opportunity.
Welcome, I'm in Ukraine, and I'm looking for options for temporary family support, and I've got two kids with me.
5 rockets hit my native Lion
My soul is filled with quiet joy, and I look at Josie and see her happiness, her confidence in her steps.
Can Victor help us with the fridge tomorrow?
This week I could come on Wednesday, and the next, guess what I could on Thursday.
Yeah, I know what to do.
And I'll be grateful if you'll tell me at the beginning that I'll do everything you need.
We usually need one of the adults' passports.
In the Brovarsk, Vishgorod, and Busan districts of Kyiv, which have been freed from the occupation, an increased command hour of 2 days will be introduced.
The direct language of Paulus is: "In the towns of Brovarski, Vishgorod and Buchani districts, which were under Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian Defence Force, the commanding hour has been increased!
In the area of these towns and villages, restrictions will take effect from 9 a.m. to 6 a.m. on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the shelling, at this time it is absolutely forbidden to stay in the streets of the population and in other public places, to travel and to walk.
The inhabitants can only go out during an alarm signal to get into hiding.
Such limitations are used to remove the effects of Russian violence — to clean up and change areas.
The lodger called on people who had left those areas for the time being to avoid returning home.
At the end of the district of Kiev, the commanding hour will be from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day.
I haven't sent anything from school yet. I only have a payment receipt.
1. Do you not have sufficient information? If so, what type, type.

2. The school meal provides for the feeding of properly registered children between the ages of 2 and 6 years, for children with a timeout (7 years) and for the feeding of child gardeners.
I'm telling you, I've always been the first to leave a person, but then I was asked for forgiveness, and I was trying to get back together.
But I didn't need it anymore if I was disappointed in a person for ever.
We're four people, two adults, and two kids, this is a very small apartment, and we need another room, blood.

We heard you were going to school.
Take me to your government
I came back early Monday morning, and the alarm went off.
I have to go to the apartment, we'll move, we'll find an apartment, and there's no furniture, no fridge, no sterile car...
Why didn't you?
It doesn't fit, to Prague to drive, it'll be very expensive, and it won't work, it'll take a long time to drive.

There's a word-to-word translation from that document in Czech.
Only below added an explanation of what inkaso is.
I've got an account, I've got it from another bank, because I had to have a job bill.
The Serbian defence budget grew exponentially for several years.
In total, over the past six years Serbia has invested over two billion euros in modernizing the army, updating military technology and building up modern systems, rising to 22 places on the list of the world's most powerful military states.
After a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the western countries took the prediction of a possible earthquake in the Atlantic seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complex and globalized.
If you don't mind I'd come

If you're in the Czech Republic without a driver's license, you're not allowed to drive.
Other frequent questions about driver's rights:
I have a driver's certificate, a valid one in Ukraine, can I run it in the Czech Republic?
However, if you are in the Czech Republic for more than one year, you must trade it in the university for a Czech driving licence.
The period of validity of the driver's driver's license is over, so what do you do with it?
• The period of operation which expired after 1.1.2022 is still valid.
• The period of operation has expired to 1.2022 - is invalid, and you have to add an exam,
I have a real Ukrainian driver's certificate, and I want to trade it in Czech:
• Staying in Czech Republic for at least 185 days in the calendar year.
• It may be replaced by a unit in the unit according to the place of residence.
I don't really have a driver's license, and I want to have a Czech:
• Needs completion of driving school, completion of a car driver's examination.
Ask us for the procedure for drawing up the exam.

And I don't want any of my acquaintances to see this.
Can I ask you a question?
Do you know how life went with those girls who left you?
They wanted to come back to you?
Did they create a new relationship?

Lucašenka's regime has delayed three whiteroses for 27 and 28 years, associated with the destruction of two relay cabinets of a signal installation under the Osipowics, which provides for the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radiya Svoboda," law protection center "Wizna", head of the MBC criminal police, Gennady Kasakevich, quoted by the Belta State Information Service
In the MIF of Belarus, it was reported that on the night of March 30th, three inhabitants of Bobruisk were apprehended for the force of the special forces of the SODR, one of whom was wounded.
According to "Embark," men were actively resisting and trying to escape when they were apprehended.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the arrested persons has been injured and is in a medical institution.
Others were provided with on-site medical care.
The head of the MEC criminal police, Bilorussia Gennady Kasakevich, stated that "the acts of terror on the RB railway will be severely stopped" by the armed forces.
On April 6th, it was reported that on March 30th, the police arrested another Belarusian railway employee, a fellow from the Baranowitsk branch of the BDZ and the administrator of the subject-matter resources of the BDZ in Vkontactia and the Single Owners of Valentine Samasyuk.
Where he is now and where he is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
By the end of March, at least 40 railroadmen were delayed for diversion in Belarus.
Remember, the formation of the BYpol, declared by the Lukashenka regime to be extremist, continues to call upon the Belarusians to disrupt the railway and Belarusian infrastructure in the framework of the Peragogue plan.
Belarusian "rivalents" are thus trying to resist Russian violence against Ukraine.
As we know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is moving to the Ukraine to fight, to live in power and technology.
It's to raise self-esteem.

The US bans investments in the Russian Federation and enforces sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, has introduced new sanctions against the daughters of the Russian President of Putin, the largest Russian banks of the Alpha Bank and the Sberbank, and bans all new investments in Russia.
This is reported on the White House site.
The silver bank is Russia's largest financial institution, which is owned by the government, and the Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets that affect the US financial system and ban US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will completely ban new investments in the Russian Federation.
For this purpose, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on over 600 multinational companies' decision to withdraw from Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes industry, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as legal and consulting companies,” is in the White House's declaration.
The third step of new US sanctions has been restrictions on large Russian government companies in the critical sphere.
This will ban U.S. citizens from dealing with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the U.S. courts.
A detailed list of Minfin will announce the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the total blocking of the adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the foreign minister of Lavrov's affairs, as well as the members of the Russian Security Council, including the President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Mishustin.
The sanctions disable them from the US financial system and freeze all the assets they own in the United States.
You can only get to this place, keep the drive closed and I'll come to you
Vera, can we wash the dishes in the car now?
My name is Olga, and before the war, I was a flight attendant for SkyAp, and my mom was an industrial sewer, and Macorchik's baby went to the garden.
We lived perfectly, but we did not even think that we would be forced to run away because we were no longer able to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we have the hope that someone will take us home for the first time) we can even pay for a room or apartment, but if it's in our pocket.
Cleanliness and order are guaranteed.
We don't have bad habits.
Let us be grateful for such help at such a time.
After dinner I had one English lecture and then went to work in the children's room.
There I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands everything and does everything well.
I also met Mrs. Lena and she and I talked about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.
It's a free voyage.
You can call school, Kiera doesn't pick up her phone, doesn't answer, I don't know if she's in school.
They're blocking the Russian office: stopping investments and stopping supplies.
However, we did not understand.
We didn't have any military in our house.
Our house is near the military and naphtobasa
He just helped me because I couldn't handle it myself.
Smoothly cooking, not asking for, and giving good advice
I'm doing myself a favor.
It's a little difficult for me, but I realize I have to go through this stage.
I'll meet you Thursday and I'll tell you everything.
Everything's fine.
Play how often you clean
I clean up every week.
I'm sorry I don't have a program, but I'll try and figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher
My girls can't move anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you were to hear information about the living, you would let me know.
I'd love to rent a living with some decent girl.
If you may know such a thing, let me know.
On my part, I won't let you down.
Thank you very much.
Hasn't written you another person to Natalie for 54 years. Please write to the exact address and how much the course costs.
I think you better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I haven't changed my nickname since I was born:)
Mr. Reyard, I'm sorry I haven't seen you.
We're going to a medical commission now.
I mean, we're going to have to work this hour on another day.
On what day should she come early? (Can on what day a little more work?)
I'll hear you tomorrow, the Internet is not working well.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thank you... we found something out of the stuff, but there was nothing out of technology...
Both begin, except for the obscurity
Nothing's happening.
May I on Monday 2504?
You can take the kids with you, you have enough toys here:)
I guessed about my dad
I'm probably very naive or very fond of it, but I'll come up with something about that money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how will it be paid, please, no credit.
Write to me straight and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Shall we take with us those clothes that have been given?
It's not my day. There's been a break in the living room. One morning.
Something came from you, I can't see that
I'm very sad too.
I'll remind you of the fact later.
Is your dad the only one who speaks Russian and understands Russian?
What day does a colleague want to do cleaning and how many windows does a house have?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you.
Raju to read to Joe Dispatch, he's scientifically researching the influence of external factors and the formation of new neural connections.
Natalia Nagorna, a 1+1 television journalist, published a video on April 12th morning, which was handed over to her by the 36th Marine military team from Mariopole.
In it the military said that they had no weapons left to take part in the fighting, and a mountain of wounded people.
They said "the count goes for hours."
Earlier, April 11th, 36th, a separate marine team involved in the defence of Mariopole published an address to the Ukrainians in Russian.
It was said that April 11th could be the last battle for the advocates of Mariopole, and the Ukrainian military command had not been associated with the combatants for two weeks.
In the social media, there was a scepticism that the application was published in Russian.
The Chief Commandant of the U.K. Defence Force, Valerius Enemy, assured that the command of the defence forces in Mariopole is connected, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian combatants in the Azovstall factory in Mariopole and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariopole.
As reported by the leader of Azowa, Andrew Bieltski, the Russian army has used chemical weapons over the Azostal factory, which keeps the Azov regiment fighting.
Thank you, I'll fix it for you.
The situation is the same as we're still here.
Two hours driving ) walks, mom shopping and back)!
That doesn't matter.
She forgot what she was going to do here.
The Chechen Drone Eskadrilla has now begun flying over Ukraine.
Nearly 50 professional coppers will serve to detect, and some will serve to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers sent a bird to Ukraine the previous day thanks to a member of Mukachev's town town of Volodymyr Lubutenka.
Today, for their inter-green friends, led by the village council leader and facilitator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Basil Shour, have delivered the Drones for their purpose: they have received special divisions of the Ukrainian military in various cities where fighting is currently taking place.
For the most efficient and safe use of coppers, we'll keep them in secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what they're doing, say that the next few days in Ukraine will send many more interesting gifts that will serve to destroy the Russian occupation and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I love sweet, but I can't without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine soon, and I'm going to work.
If it's okay, I'll take it.
I'll try myself, but if there's a splash, I'll write you, if I may?
The main thing is to understand each other.
We were personally in the lady's old age in the village of Jonah, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said there was nothing to live
Maybe she'll be happy and get her mood up.
I got my phone repaired today.
And I think I'm still on the street today.
I've had a drink of medicine and tea, and I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but I'd rather meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have the time, send me the music you like.
I'm interested in what you've got to do with music.
Mom and Dad Need to Be Obeyed
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's carriage.
It was colder and rainier today, and tomorrow should be warmer.
But it's not a pity the houses have been destroyed, the people are being abused by the occupier.
In Herson, the occupier was molested by a monument called "Slave Ukraine" in Herson on the street of Perescope.
Details: It is reported that the unknown flags of the European Union have broken down, cut panels with pictures of the Celestial Hundred and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The occupiers ripped off portraits of the heroes of the Celestial 100 and of the fallen Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag has been struck.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for the stroller, we don't have that custom because we didn't know, we gave the kids only chocolate and biscuit, maybe something else had to be given.
In Czech, there's someone to talk to.
Because I live in a kind of neighborhood up to twelve people here, and then they go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I was in the nursery today.
Even today, I've been sleeping there.
So we've made great progress.
I'll have to bring the cookies another time!
I don't have the power to do them anymore.
Since I'm being pushed away from the day and time that the cleaning work is after the guests, I can say something about April of the month, because I've got a schedule for cleaning the apartments.
For the May month--I can say about it at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
I just wondered if you were talking about it.
Hi, I'm sorry I haven't written off for a long time and I've had a little sleep.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or meet you after you've arrived)
He's a modest, recent student, and he's got a lot to learn.
(Applause) It went very well.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people in such a high position.
Now I've learned a lesson from a lady who's the director of the economics department of the edge of highland.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grisko in the nursery behaved well.
Monday I have to bring you a job confirmation and a cash payment for the nursery.
I'm on my way to Friday
I don't do anything just a lot to them and I sleep.
If he goes to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you, if that's okay.
I have to deliver another analysis
I'll never have to go again.
There's a very bad drilling, a bad washing, a master, and we need to fix it.
So there's enough.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to a course in the Czech language you have signed up for.
And the children are fed there, or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment you can come in here, there's one question.
If needed more help write
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
From the beginning, we didn't really want you to raise money, so people didn't think we were burning at it!
But I didn't have two points to fill out online:
I'm going to lie down for a rest, get some energy and strength. Thank you for your present.
This is a great idea, and I'm going to see the video, and it's going to be good, because the whole family is going to be drawing.
The University of California calls upon employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in media and social networks, hearsays and gossip.
Orientate only on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who remained in Ukraine, is also helping the army.
I got a couple of jobs for my wallet.
After the holidays, we'll have to have an internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I'm going to get the day I wasn't at work is a rendition
HQ Summary: Russia prepares a provocation in Predinaster to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Predinaster region of Moldova to blame Ukraine for "aggression against the neighbouring State."
It is true that "the military forces of the Russian Federation are not excluded from provocative actions in the Pre-Ninistrian region of the Republic of Moldova with a view to accusing Ukraine of being aggressive against the neighbouring State."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of military forces for action in the Slotholyan direction.
In the nearest days, the occupier will probably try to regain the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send a special contingent, weapons, and equipment to fight in Ukraine.
The training of the armed and military equipment is being carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th single Moto-Shooter Team (Monastre) of the 5th General army of the Eastern Military Region.
It is likely that the weapon will be moved to the temporarily occupied area of the Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the loss of a special unit of the Battalion Tactical Team of the 36th single Moto-Snippet Team (Borgia, Zabaikal Province) 29 military officers of the Eastern Military Region are being recruited from the assigned team.
The enemy has a particular problem in putting together drivers and driver mechanics.
The selection of the selected individual from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the opponent, in order to disrupt the supply of the truck to the battlefields, will continue to strike the transport infrastructure in Ukraine for the purpose of destroying or dissolving it.
The designated divisions of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to enhance the protection of the Ukrainian-Blorussian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Slotholy direction, separate subdivisions of the 6th General army and the northern coast forces continue to block the city of Harkow and continue to shoot in separate areas of the city.
On the Isosian direction, an air search of the area continues for the purpose of detecting the positions of the Ukrainian armed forces.
The adversary uses Eagle 10 for this.
Forced by two Battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to make an attack in the direction of the villages of Longenke and Dimitruk, without success, and took up previously occupied positions.
In the Donski direction, the main effort continues to focus on taking control of the localities of Popasna, Rubinje, Lower, and Novobahmutha, as well as placing full control over the city of Mariopole.
The enemy tried to launch an attack in the Golden Area, and it didn't work.
In the city of Mariopole, the occupying forces, using artillery and air operations, continue to storm areas of the Avostal plant and the seaport.
By separate subdivisions, the enemy fired gunfire at the positions of the Ukrainian military in the areas of Excopill, Joblovovka and Maryansk.
In the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, Ukraine's defenders have suffered four enemy attacks over the past century, five tanks have been destroyed, eight armoured, six units of vehicle technology and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't you understand what you're thinking?
We'll usually try to catch up, but I doubt
And how can you sleep and I'll keep you
Are you sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I'll understand.
We haven't seen a TV at home, and we don't have to set it up.
I'm going to turn on the TV just to listen to the language of the Czech.
I'm about to finish my month-rate package today:)
Can we do that on the phone today?
Tea to sew, jaw, thread to sew
I understand that I can prepare the material in this field.
I'm a little ashamed to ask, she's giving us so much cake.
I'll meet my father later, I'll be sure to.
I've read the appearance in Facebook, so Google probably wrote something in his own way.
Good afternoon, we're the things you brought, but there are things that we're small can bring you in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about the job.
If Mr. Director is satisfied, I can start work next week because tomorrow afternoon I plan to go to the office to file (if you get very long queues) and on Saturday it rains:)
Looking for a team at the beginning, very fond of chemistry in high school, learning Czech to know perfectly, dreaming of working on Tevy
Friends of old and not so much, friends I don't know personally, friends of spirit and mind.
Now you too have had difficult times.
For the last month, I've been communicating with many of you.
Your life, which had never been easy, turned from foot to head, as did the lives of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilty and ashamed because of your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because they're giving up Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cercasov, a very old friend of Memorial.
Let's tell you a little later, – as usual, Martha answered in a brief way. — Now, after we've searched, we're going through the ruins.
Others -- artists, artists, critics, writers -- are astonished at the sudden collapse of your tiny world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists; most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of a very few of you -- those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Newspaper, in the Echo Moscow, in the Medusa, in the Navaya and in a few other places -- have many of you done anything to resist this regime?
Except for participating in a meeting when they were still happening.
Read also the column of a Russian journalist called "It's too late to hide, It's too late to keep quiet."
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they're caused by your continued indifference to what's happening around you, your apathy and your patient association, which now may have put a great burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like that.
In 1990 there was a short period when you had to some extent enjoyed freedom and democracy – a messy, even bloodthirsty, but real one.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why, every time you finally have a revolution, do you finally have such a strong fear of grief that you seek salvation behind the King, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel safer around him.
Indeed, mistakes have been made.
Instead of grabbing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did with the stamps, you took your soul to the monument of Dzerzynski – and allowed the KGB to lie low, refresh, reform and take over the country.
When you were asked to choose between the country's robbery and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option, and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechen.
Survival was the main concern.
And then Putin came along, young, businessly, aggressive, and he promised to deal with the terror and raise the economy.
Few of you have bought it, but either you have voted for it or you have preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to compare the Czech with the earth again, most of you were blindfolded.
I remember well those years.
I was working in Chetchen, helping the victims of the Putinian "antiteroristic operation," and with my eyes I saw the ruins of the Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed: the torture of peaceful people, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You said to me, "No, we're sick of your Chetchen." I remember that very well.
And I said, "Friends, this isn't my Chechen, this is your Chechen.
This is your fucking country, not mine.
I'm just a silly foreigner here.
It's your power to bomb one of your cities, to kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic upturn in the middle of zero, caused by the rising oil prices and the readiness of the Router to look through his finger at the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made a good living, some have been rich, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices have risen, but what's the trouble?
Moscow was shining and shining on its cheeks.
When a number of opponents were killed – Yuri Keckichin, Anna Politski, Alexander Litwinkin, and others – many of you were shocked and expressed horrors about what was happening.
However, there was no further matter.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over President Medvedev's office and sat down as the premier, I see you've hardly paid any attention to it.
When Medvedev Russia invaded Georgia after a few months of government, most of you ignored it or denied it.
How many of you have I met in the next few years on the hills of Goodauri, in the front hills of the Fuzzy or in the cafeteria and in the Turkish tulips of Tbilisi, while a part of this country has been occupied by your army?
I have to admit, we hardly did much in the West if we did anything at all.
A little outrage, a little sanctions; but what was the importance of Russia's critical breach of international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market was so great?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the hard 1990s, it was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, were still awake.
When Putin changed places again with Medvedev and sat down as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you were massively protesting.
The name Navany became a pronunciation, you hadn't walked out of the street for half a year, and the regime finally felt frightened that it was losing soil under its feet.
He then struck back.
At first alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have received huge terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The patient is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angrily by the prophetic president, who deceived their European expectations, they once seized Maydan – and never left him again.
They completely built a tent town on their own and prepared for decisive defence.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings, and Molotov cocktails.
The police finally opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitive was Yanukowitsch, and the Ukrainians returned democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and to banish them if they did not do well.
Maydan did not like it very much.
That was a bad example.
So, using the general confusion, he took over the Krem.
Some of you were against it, but there's not much to do with it.
And how many of you have been delighted!
As far as I know, 91 percent of Russian citizens supported anecdotes.
From there suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you, who disdained Putin and his gang, suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to adore it.
It's hard for me to find a reason, because right after that we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you hid yourself in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as new after the reconstruction that began with Moscow in 2012 -- with their bingoes, commonly available Wipes and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's just getting better.
You've drawn close attention to Syria.
There were terrors, weren't there?
EVEN THE Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it in an interview then, because I had little idea of what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I drove there and I myself saw the streets of Homs being shot cold-blooded by government snipers at my children's peers.
Among all Russian citizens there were only your soldiers, who in 2015, began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Niemler:
"At first they came on socialists, but I spoke silently because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came to the tradesmen, but I spoke silently, because I'm not a tradesman.
Then they came after the Hebrews, but I spoke silently, for I am not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left to say anything to protect me."
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But most people said nothing.
Some really say now -- like Dmitro Glukhovsky, Michael Shishkin, Michael Siegar, Maxim Osipov, etc.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the interior of the country, like Marina Ovalnikov, risking entering a new GULAG or putting together a company called Navalny.
As for others, you know best where you live.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians -- or, what seems very likely if he doesn't, he'll take care of you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who have courageously but mostly alone protested and have so far been insignificant, but soon will be more serious.
For thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed dissent in social media (let's only have a black square in Instagram) or who have spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years' freedom was given just for anecdotes are not in such a distant past, and now they are likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you, who will remain?
The example of the Ukrainians -- even more than the 2014s -- frightens the Putin regime: they prove that they can be fought.
And that intelligence, motivation, and courage can stop it, no matter how depressing it may be on the paper of its advantage.
In view of everything, few in Russia are aware of this, as is the fact that war is going on.
But you, my friends, know exactly what's going on.
You read news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you communicate.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence has ended.
Your choices are just jokes, your laws, if you don't mind the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media are gone, your economy is crashing faster than I am writing, you don't have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are any flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence; he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try and drive or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you can see another option.
Still, there's another one left.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And perhaps under the conditions that came up, you'll be required less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark is not from you: because of the economic collapse that is taking place in Russia, it is likely to burn in the provinces, in small towns.
When prices go up and wages don't pay, those people who have voted for Route all these years wanting bread and peace will come out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and middle classes of Moscow and St. Petersburg, or you, my friends.
But if each city goes to a meeting in itself, as has been the case from time to time, it won't be difficult to suppress them alone.
You need to organize and coordinate. The crowd will need to be converted into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool -- an Internet that can limit the regime, but that still works and that can be adjusted under almost any circumstances.
The Navany organization has been broken up, but you can create other, more informal, more centralized ones.
There are many of you, millions of you.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If more than 300,000 comes out, it'll be astonished.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to it?
After all, to what did he make them go into Ukraine, all that he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will experience a perceived fear; but those with children will fear for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I'd be afraid if I were you, too.
In Syria, and now in Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happened to those who dared to ignore their master, who dared not only to demand freedom but really tried to gain it.
But even if you don't do anything, the lives of countless people will still be lost for nothing.
Your son will throw a joke in chat-chat computer games -- and he will be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the internet -- and will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes – and die in a gray cell under police sticks.
And that's what's been going on for many years -- and it's going to get worse, getting bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know what's going to happen.
Do it cold-blooded, think strategicly, and make it a reality.
We were on Friday in class, they told us we could come on Monday.
We'll be home in the evening
That you perceive me as the press of the secretary
Viko, how often do you go to dinner at a fancy restaurant?
Once a day on my mouth I go to dinner at a fancy restaurant
I'll try to explain everything to her)
So we liked it very nice and we wanted something brighter because it's a better option.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people.
I don't feel well, coughing, temperature, voice disappearing, weakness and head spinning
I have to go to that government of labor
We've already done it, but they said who registered in April half the money only at the end of the month.
Thursday we need a break, we'll go with the kids to the doctor.
But at night I was writing to a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her and I'll be sure to report it.
As a prokurator, I thought I was going to be a career, and I spent a lot of time and energy.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental job in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a pity to have lost time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am a socialist, but love and marriage are taken seriously.
There was one man I had to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I think people have to love, respect, trust each other in order to create a family.
Now, I haven't met that.
Good afternoon. Where can you get the forms to bake a pacifier or a silicon?
All right, thanks for the advice, then I'll put a witness on Valya right away.
She's got a DPP in her lying state, now she's got a broken foot in her hips, a stroller in her lying position, the whole food is wiping in a blender
Mr. Reyhart, I'm sorry I bother you at work.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie's playroom today, to say hi to her.
She was in a bad situation.
For when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child away because she said she came to look at the things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerius had opened our children's room yesterday until 7 p.m.
Can that really be the case?
The working time of the room is at 4 p.m.
And finally, it's our responsibility.
But I don't have to load it without opening a very weak internet page.
Good afternoon, we're all right.) Cola's working, last night they filled out the invitations, and I was doing the seniors before the exam at the gymnasium.
It's the hardest thing to do with geometry.
On Saturday, Wladimir helped us.
She studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We Are Thankful for Our Lives
Yes, but I thought you hadn't filled out.
