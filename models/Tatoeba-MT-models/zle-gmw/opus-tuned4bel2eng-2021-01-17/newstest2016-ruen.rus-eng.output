The social card of the Ivanov Region is recognized as an electronic payment.
The changes provide for the maintenance of the public passenger transport allowance.
Since 24 September, there has been a change in the organization of favourable travel of citizens using the social map of the inhabitants of Ivanov oblast.
According to the press service, the Government of Russia in Ivanov Oblast reports that the changes provide for the maintenance of the public passenger transport allowance and bring the social card settlement scheme into line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 on the National Payment System.
At the same time, the social map of Ivanov ' s region is recognized as an electronic payment.
The conditions for its application are therefore changing.
Thus, the maturity limit is no longer set for travel, as it was before, but for money, with winter and summer periods not exceeding 400 roubles in winter, and not more than 800 roubles in summer for the current month.
Now social card holders on transport receipts will have to track the balance of money rather than the number of remaining trips.
The cost of favourable travel for citizens would be 1/2 times the rate in effect for the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is paid for by the Regional Budget.
The schedule for updating the social card remains the same, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new procedure for travelling on a social map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep a detailed accounting of the spending of money on a social map to the point of copying.
There is also the possibility of refunding accrued but unexpended money.
Add that the scheme of payments with the carriers is becoming transparent, since now half the cost of the journey is paid by the citizen and the same amount is paid to the carrier.
No commission will be charged to put money on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the Ivanov Road and Transport Department, reported that more than 33 million social card trips were made in the region in 2014 and nearly 25 million in 2015.
More than 470 million roubles are provided for in the district budget for the provision of favourable travel of citizens using a social map.
As at 1 September, compensation for this purpose amounted to over 312 million roubles.
At the time of the 9-1-1 call, the teacher confessed to murdering a friend.
At the time of the 911 call, the teacher at the University of Lannon Lamb told the police almost without trembling that he had shot his friend and that he needed officers to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that there was a dog in the house who was alive, but probably upset, and said that family contact with the victim could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note that was negligently written on a white sheet of linted paper, saying, "I'm sorry, I wish I could get it all back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," said the authorities that Lamb had signed.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who was conducting two online courses at the University of Delta, in the state of Cliveland, Mississippi, had by then managed to drive 300 miles to a university college where the police believed that he had shot all the respected professors of history, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
The Chief of the police at the University of Delta, Lynn Baford, reported that the university officials found out about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb had made that true call to the 9-1-1 shortly afterwards.
By the end of the day, the victims would be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the authorities were still trying to put together the motives behind Lamb.
The information shared by investigators from both sides of the state, as well as by students and employees who knew him, helped to shape a talented but perhaps troubled teacher.
The students said they looked forward to his classes.
The police in Gauthia, where Trentis died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he expressed appreciation for the "beautiful people" with whom he had interacted in his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students have attended both.
At the same time, there were some preconditions for problems.
One student who spoke well about Lamba, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him about his struggle with stress at the end of the school year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the University of the State of Delta to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online classes.
Recent changes in university employment rules meant that the doctor's degree, which Lamb had worked so hard to obtain, would not automatically guarantee him a teacher's post.
University President William Laforge said he didn't know anything about the Lamb-Buttert conflict, but "apparently, Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police caught a trace of Lamb after his escape from the Campus while he was on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a rectangular .38 in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents' house in Greenville, Mississippi, reported by the coroner of Washington Metel Johnson County.
His engine car was still standing on the driveway.
It was not clear why Lamb had come to this house, although, according to Johnston, she believed that he knew the people living in it.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at a university with 3,500 students in a town with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and education.
He received a Ph.D. in the spring of that year.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful man.
Carla Hayerston told me that she was 15 years old and that Lamba was 20 years old when they met through friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who for years tried to teach her how to play a gitar.
In those years he had been successful with women.
All the girls were melting when he was there," said Harerston, who is now 40 and lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brendan.
Lamb and Trentis seem to have met for a while by the time of the event.
During a call at 911 Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gauthia in a brick house, the back of which came into the canal.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
Princeton's ex-husband, Sean O'Stine, reported that they had divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends, and that they had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She's quite upset," said O'Stine about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stine said he hadn't met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter, Abigail, that Lamb was interested in music and was playing blues.
Lamb met Trentis when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stine said his daughter wrote music and sang.
Prantis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Shaffer, the bartender and co-co-ordinator of entertainment programs in a gloomy-lighted bar in Gothier's suburb, said that he had last seen Lamb and Trentis in the evening of September 5, when Lamb had finished playing the Gitarre and the lipstick for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and making fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a lost teacher, held a freshman's workshop and specialized in the history of Native Americans and Kolonial America, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three little kids.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student self-government.
At the University of the State of the Delta University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, took part in a monumental candle lighting ceremony.
Smith's wife, Liz, and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the ceremony during which the university chorus sang the Bright Morning Star and the Amazon Grace.
The classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
Crisis over.
Today's the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cliveland, Mississippi.
The report was prepared by the Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police ' s statement that Lamb ' s call was received by the police in the wake of the murder of Schmidt, and that although Lamb had referred to his wife as his wife when he called the police in the matter, information that they were married had not been confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that he will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as he did last year, and that the toy and product reteller for children will provide regular and temporary staff with more hours to work.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and optics across the country, which is less than the 45,000 people employed for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would start interviews with the applicant this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although a few more months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to have enough staff in shops and to sell, ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about dating princess Diana.
The premiere of "Rear to the Future" turned out to be a huge event for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons too.
"We were sitting in the theater and waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and then it hit me -- the princess Diana would be sitting next to me," he said in the caravan by the soon-to-be-screen documentary "Back in Time."
The film starts, and it comes to my mind that I'm literally at the distance of my arm and in one fake yawn from dating the princess of Wales.
"Rear in Time" -- a documentary about the film "Reverse to the Future" -- includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the director Robert Zemekis and Executive Producer Stephen Spelberg.
The film was premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spelberg, "it is certainly the greatest time travel film ever made."
"Rear in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD, and some movie theaters in October.
UN Head states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in response to Russia's military support for Syria, states that for almost five years there is no “war solution” conflict, and an increase in weapons will only increase violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the UN once again called upon all the participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive talks in order to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council — the US, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France during the General Assembly's ministerial session this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had made the situation “unsolved”.
Ban Ki-moon called upon the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had shown in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 poll results that show that Donald Trump isn't joking
Some tried to label him a provocateur.
Others waved away from him, taking it as a joke.
And some demand scandal.
But no matter how hard some Republicans try to shake the high position of Donald Trump in the polls, they have failed (for the time being).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed the advantage of Donald Trump in double digits, and some are beginning to ask seriously what this means to a real estate magnet in terms of the chances of being nominated.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate a Republican party.
The experts indicate that Rick Perry gave up his popularity to Herman Kane at that time in 2011, none of whom won a single state in the process of nominating.
And there's a lot of reasons why he'd be fighting in general elections.
But external groups, such as the "Supercomite for Political Activism" of Jeb Bush, and the economic conservatory group of the Growth Club recognize the unrelenting power of Trump and are beginning to get their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some numbers of polls that say that a real estate magnet isn't just an intermediate phase:
Trump's sympathizer ratings are 180 degrees wide.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-July, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive attitude towards this real estate magnet.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a positive attitude toward Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these are going to take precedence in the early stages.
A quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of the Republicans there were positive about Trump.
Two thirds of those who voted for GOP would have Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said that they were either "excited" or "pleasing" if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "disappointed" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they'd be excited about 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
Next to the level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republicans say they'll be "unsatisfied" or "dissatisfied" if Jeb W. Bush's favorite student becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temper is a problem.
While Trump is heavily criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of voters across the country believe that the Magnatus has the right temper to be president, as shown by a Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same figure appears at the country's first closed assembly in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think he's the one who might be in charge, according to Queenipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he's not the type of person who can be effective in office, and nearly six of the 10 independent voters say that his temper is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to that idea.
When they wear their expert hats, the Republican voters think Trump is serious.
On the question of who is the most likely winner of the GOP nominator, four out of ten said that Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of ten put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Fully exposed: voters had never had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many voters in GOP consider Trump's campaign to be persuasive.
Even if the Republicans were united around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts indicate that such a spread is likely to have the advantage of Trump, while those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among more than a dozen other candidates who support Trump.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical one-to-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always receives majority support.
It's 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorine, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points ahead, and finally Rand Paul, John Cassic and Chris Christie 33 points ahead.
He's got a tie with Ted Cruise.
The only candidate who's around him?
Ben Carson overcame a businessman for 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one competition.
A little over half of the followers of Donald Trump say they've changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only over half of the voters supporting Trump say they're confident of their voices.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
Forty-six percent say they keep the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with an outsider colleague, Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “the rapists” two months ago in his campaign opening speech, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant one in conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's glimpse will distract key voters of Latin American descent from the Republican party and prevent re-lending.
But according to a Monday ABC/Post poll, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration matters.
So as long as immigration attracts universal attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
The government's disappointment is gaining new momentum.
Now, Donald Trump and Ben Carson rely on the support of about half the Republican voters, mainly because of their outside status.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post poll says they want a political outsider rather than a man with government experience.
And they're also offended at Washington.
A survey of Des Moins Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were disappointed by the Republicans' activities in the Congress, with 54% "unsatisfied" and 21% "in rage."
The government will decide the fate of the pension index in October.
The vice-premier of the Russian Federation, Olga Hungryec, said that the government was currently looking for options to implement the 2016 law on the indexation of pensions to a real inflation rate, and was handing over to the WP.
It indicated that a solution was to be found by 8 October, by the time the next year's draft budget was submitted to the Government.
In addition, the cabmint discusses the possibility of extending the decision to freeze the accumulated pension to Russians.
The hungry observed that the sum of pension saving is 350 billion roubles.
About the same is the cost of indexing the total pension for the following year.
According to the Vice-Premier, there is not yet a final decision on who should pay the contributions for the unemployed.
The hungry is of the view that if a person is not employed on his or her own initiative and is not treated as a vulnerable person, it is not entirely fair that a society pays for him or her.
The media had previously reported that they were considering two options for balancing government budget.
Why are the eyes often irritated and red?
Answers doctor-optalmologist Tatiana Levashov:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
By forgetting to cleanse the century regularly, we often contribute to the development of bloom.
Quit simple:
Do not tremble your eyes with your filthy hands, carry with you a special wet napkin for the century;
At least 1 to 2 times a day, clean up the ages of their daily accumulation of dangerous substances.
Cleaning procedures need to be accompanied by warm compresses with herbals (shalphea, rummy) which lighten the thick secret of the saline glands and then massage the edges of the century, which should be carried out in circular motions of the fingertips;
Do not use alcohol when washing your make-up.
They dry and dehydrate the skin, and they contribute to the greater obscurity of the secret of the salt gland.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear agents have created a nuclear warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, was running "at full power."
This report was published on the national central telegraphic agency's website.
It is observed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is ready to respond at any moment to the US's “aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons both in quantity and in quality.
The North Korean authorities carried out the last nuclear weapon test in 2013.
However, no plans have been reported to re-establish the full operation of the reactor since then.
Pyongyang claims he managed to create a nuclear warhead.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has also tested medium-range and small-range rockets on numerous occasions, writing policy.ru.
Zhirinovski demanded that the Russian anthem be removed from the mention of the brotherly nations.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinowski believes that the reference to the union of brotherly people should be removed from the national anthem.
He announced this during the State Duma meeting, reports to the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even sportsmen can't stand," said Girinowski.
The MP believes that it is necessary to remove all four-point members containing this line:
In the summer of 2014 Zhirinowski declared that the current anthem should be changed to "God save the King" and that the Russian tricolour should be replaced with the Imperial flag, writing polit.ru.
Assad called upon all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Assad called upon all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the problem of refugees, they must stop supporting the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans care about refugees, let them stop supporting the terror.
That's our opinion on the matter.
"That's the essence of the question of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach a consensus.
However, if we want real success, they will not be possible as long as people die, as long as the bloodbath continues and as long as people do not feel completely secure.
"So we can reach a consensus, but we can't do anything until we've won terror in Syria," stressed Al-Assad.
Let us recall that about 500,000 immigrants, including those from Syria, have arrived in the European Union this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world had been the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that thousands of elements of the Islamic State extremist group may be among the immigrants who come to Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization prohibited in Russia may use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The inhabitants of the German city had arranged a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany had become a leader in hosting refugees, although it had recently increased border controls in order to contain their tide.
The authorities estimate that about 800,000 immigrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts mention significant numbers.
Since early September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived.
A BBC correspondent, Jenny Hill, visited the town of Darmstad, whose inhabitants offer a very warm welcome to immigrants.
Jeremy Corbin debuts at the Prime Minister's questions session.
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut at the issues session is expected to the Prime Minister very eagerly
The new leader of the labour party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon speak for the first time at the Prime Minister's question session, for the first time in a struggle with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six issues in the afternoon; he will probably be closely followed by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He made a call for "lower theatre and more facts" at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could skip some of the meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbin's first parliamentary test as leader; it will take place after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Treadunion Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the labourers to stand silent during the performance of the national anthem on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the British Battle, led to criticism by a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several front-line articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Mr. Corbin's Spokesman stated that he had "stayed in respectable silence" and recognized "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr. Corbin's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, informed Newsnight at BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the laborers to sing the national anthem "indistinctly" from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow Ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbin's team, expressing their differences on economic, defence and international politics, while less than one-six members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, says that political differences will also “close” in the labor party after Mr. Corbin's appointment to the European Union and government restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Treadunion conference that the Labour Party had made changes to remove the very idea of limitations in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Shadow Minister of Labor and Retirement, said that there was “full clarity” in the party that it was in opposition only to government plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the labour force to meet David Cameron at the "Courier Box" in the last 10 years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the labour force, who had promised a different approach to politics, stated that he had “involved the collective resources” to get Mr. Cameron's ideas and had received more than 30,000 suggestions.
A member of Parliament from the Aylington North district said that the Prime Minister's issues were caused by excessive confrontation, and that he would refrain from the witty answers and the exchange of thorns, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems faced by young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Economics in the shadow office, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was absent, for example when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also offered the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had addressed the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercoe, to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to get away from the political style of the “argumentary bagan” often associated with the procedure to the Prime Minister, but he acknowledged a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990 the Prime Minister's issues have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to run the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reform.
"Shopping in Joburg." Homeless young people who learned to be photographers

Pound sterling increases as wages rise in the United Kingdom
The Pound grew against the background of the increase in wages in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising as a result of an offer to buy SABMiller.
Between May and June, British income, minus bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth has been the highest since 2009 and has been met as an earlier postponement of projections of possible increases in quotations.
The Pound sterling rose by over 1% in relation to the dollar to $1.5505 and 0.84% in relation to the euro by i.e. 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index has grown to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
Against the background, SABMiller shares grew by 20 percent as a result of a purchase offer made by a competitor, AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the two largest brewery companies in the world, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artoys, Peroni and Grolsch.
Buberry stock grew by 0.9%, with encouraging news from a competitive group of suites of Richemont.
Recent sales data on Richemont exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - on the key market for Burberry - have begun to grow again.
Glencore stock grew by 5% after a mining giant announced that it had managed to earn $2.5 billion by placing shares as part of a debt reduction strategy.
The stock of the Mondi paper and packaging group was the leader of the drop in the index by 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's rating to "sell."
The JD Sports stock grew after a sports clothing company reported an increase of 83 percent in revenue before taxes in six months to £46.6 million.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages can prevent expansion
The Executive Director of JD Sports, Peter Cougil, says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such a purchasing power will exceed the increase in the cost of work, he says.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up food provider launched an IGA market share protection campaign in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the anticipated infusion of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open two warehouses and the first of the 120 stores in South and West Australia early next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets are building relationships with local food providers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media and social media and on "Adelaide Show".
The campaign is supported by IGA retellers and providers, such as the manufacturer of the Simmo's ice cream from Dunsboro, who offers a taste in IGA stores, and shop owners selling discounted tickets to the South Australia Football League.
Metcash is expected to provide more details of its protection strategy on 29 September, the day that this bulk food, liquor and economics provider will spend its annual investor's strategy day.
In South Australia and Western Australia, stores with an IGA brand account for almost 30 percent of all Metcash stores and show a higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Customers in South and West Australia are known as followers of traditional routes, so the market is more favourable for IGA retellers than in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA, compared with about 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening their first shops, taking out sales from all players present, but mostly from independent retellers.
In a report published this week, Tom Keirat, an analyst of the Moran Stanley, estimates that IGA Ritters may lose $360 million a year and Metcash will lose 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, selling $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
Loss of income and sales of food at a high constant cost of Metcash may cost a company about 13 million income before interest and taxes are paid, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash loses a market share in the Eastern States, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal customers.
In Morocco Stanley, food sales from Metcash are expected to fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and by 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglas's leading stock manager, the founder of the Madellan Financial Group, noticed at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "could very likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the Board of Directors of Metcash had contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA in the market has fallen from 18 to 14 per cent since 2010 and Metcash's income from the food business, which the company provides to some 1,200 IGA Riteillers, has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 as a result of operating decommissioning and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up spending more than $150 million a year to equalize retail prices with those of Coles and Woolworths for a thousand items each week and to help IGA retaliators re-establish trade sites, as well as offering a fast-growing range of fresh food and a broader choice of manufactured food.
The director-general of Metcash, Ian Morris, said that price-equivalent and re-equivalent commercial areas were on the rise, and hoped that the company would achieve an increase in net returns in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanashi Cockkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves credit, not criticism for his behaviour.
Tanashi Kokkinakis has been indirectly affected by the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more credit for his behaviour than criticism, as President Steve Healy of Tennis Australia says.
Cockinakis, the youngest in a talented duo and often called "Special Ks", was involuntarily placed at the centre of attention because of the shameful fighting between Kirjos and Stan Vaurinca at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly afterwards, during a hot Cincinnati qualifying match, the judge at the tower had to separate Cockinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, twice, and Harrison said, "The wurm was to be put on Kiryos' spades, and I must put it on this guy's spades."
Since the last time Cockkinakis was seen breaking a racket after a cramp in his leg saved Richard Gasque from a possible defeat on US Open, Healy is loyally defending Cockinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomic in solitary in the semifinal Davis Cup against the United Kingdom.
"I'm really worried about one thing, namely that Tanashi got involved in a conflict," said Healy.
He really broke the racket when he got his leg together on US Open, but he's not the first player to break the racket when hopes collapsed, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact he was very good at himself in rather promiscuous situations at the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard, he fits well into the team, he's never had a problem with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's heavily trained, he's in excellent shape, he's a very focused and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for the important match that began on Friday, believing that "mutual consent" was the right way out for everyone, but hoping that the guy from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term player.
"Before all, we want the team to focus completely on the match, not on the arguments around [Kyrios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick gained power very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray prove, he grows up in front of the public, he makes some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of the spot for a while so he can think about them, and that's the best for the team and the best for him.
Migration Crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, apprehends immigrants
After announcing a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on Tuesday at the southern border and apprehended those who were attempting to infiltrate the country illegally in order to deter the flow of immigrants.
There had been riots on the border, with hundreds of immigrants congregating on the border, on which the Serbian authorities had reacted sharply.
People fleeing armed violence in their home countries had broken up their tents and settled on the road between the two countries for an indefinite period.
However, discontent had begun.
When a police helicopter circled over them, the immigrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian special police.
Some protested against food and water.
The Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs declared the expulsion of immigrants from Hungary to be “unacceptable” when they came more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not the associated damage.
It is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Daccic in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serb border began the day after a bloc of 28 countries was unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to take common responsibility for 40,000 persons seeking asylum in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) an agreement would be reached that European Union member States would receive an additional 120,000 refugees, including those from Hungary.
German chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a European Union emergency summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis affecting the continent.
Hungary, however, did not expect swift action on the part of Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to deal with the crisis, enabling them to block roads and speed up asylum trials.
Meanwhile, the Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Peter Sillarto, said that his country was also planning to build a fence with barbed wire on the border with Romania to block the flow of immigrants through the country now that it had completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even the prisoners were involved in urgent work to complete the fence with barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “narrow spot” and border crossing point for the European Union's settlers, many of whom are refugees, victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban insists that most of the people who come into the country are economic immigrants seeking a better life than refugees who are victims of military actions that have the right to protection, and this view is sharply contradicted by the views of other EU countries, Germany.
The new laws which entered Hungary at midnight now make it an offence to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) fence with barbed wire constructed by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for accused persons of human trafficking.
"Because of a situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," said a government official named Zoltan Kovac in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Officially, Parliament is still required to approve the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but reporters of the Associated Press, who are at the border, have been witnessing for days the presence of armed soldiers with transport and dogs.
Djerdi Bacondi, Orban's National Security Adviser, reported that 45 persons trying to cross the border at the very border had been caught by the authorized authorities, while another 15 had been caught inside the country.
They have crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of administrative offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly restore the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on Tuesday morning on the border with Serbia, bringing a railway wagon wrapped with barbed wire to block one of the passages.
The riots broke out on the main passage across the border near the town of Riosque, Hungary, because the Hungarians had set up a service room to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds had pressed each other to break through.
Some 20 people were able to penetrate, and thousands remained outside.
Another group of immigrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced that food and water would be abandoned until they were allowed into Hungary.
2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been halved in a national poll
Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton continues to retain a double-digit advantage in the democratic race for nominating across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
There is now 47 per cent support for primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent), while Sanders is the second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who had not yet announced whether he was going to take part in the Presidential Race, was supported by 15 percent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the competition in the primary elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they have decided on a candidate who will be supported.
The supporters of the United Kingdom are more confident of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, he has lost support for some population groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
It holds a great advantage among women and moderates, but it has declined.
Her support among men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
The preference given by the democratic voters under 50 is gone, and he and Sanders are now equal.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month, he overcame Sanders by two digits among the liberators, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Nearly half of the primary democratic voters across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and a further 15 per cent would support it only because it was a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that current supporters of the United Kingdom are likely to be more enthusiastic about it.
Among those who do not support the current situation, there are more conflicting views -- only about a quarter enthusiastically would support it.
While 48 percent of primary democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When the protesters are asked why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that it's the time of a woman president (13 percent) and that she's the best candidate for that post (10 percent).
It's also about an association that links it to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It's also called agreement on matters and chances of being elected.
Since the Vice President was considering potential participation in the elections, 57 percent of the primary democratic voters wanted him to join the race, although one third felt he should not.
When they're asked who they want to be in second place among party candidates, the primary democratic voters are mostly called Biden.
More than half of those who support the campaign say that they would have chosen Biden as their second, that's more than Sanders'.
If Biden decides not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of the Democratic voters saw a candidate as having the best chance of winning the general elections; however, that figure had fallen from 78 per cent last month.
At this rate, Biden is the second-largest one, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in answer to the question of what is most important in a candidate, democratic voters choose other options than the possibility of being elected.
Like last month's situation, none of the candidates from the democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most people think that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are honest and trustworthy people with good leadership.
Biden, of all three, is the leader in honesty, and the strength of Clinton's leadership.
Thirty percent of the primary democratic voters did not think that it was fair and trustworthy, twice as much as those who said the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent did not have a certain opinion on it.
The primary democratic voters also generally view the same ideology as those of Clinton, Sanders and Byden.
By all accounts, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
While questions about Hillary's personal mailbox and server are still being raised by her secretary, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and feel that this has not affected their general opinion of her.
But that's a very different story for the American public at large.
Half of Americans today are not satisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided as early as March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the debate about e-mail has not affected their general opinion of Clinton at all, although 36 percent say that their opinion of it has declined.
They're mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who say they've had a hard time thinking about Clinton.
Even though it is considered fair and credible by her party, it continues to be a problem for her among the registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider it fair and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters did not consider it fair and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump fair and credible.
Both, however, are getting good leadership scores.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson, and Bush show the best results in honesty.
Most people see Sanders as more honest than not, but, like Carson, many people don't think anything of him.
The error limit for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Based on a national poll, Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in a recent CBS/New York Times poll.
These two candidates won half the vote in the new poll, leaving all others searching for support under their feet.
Voters from all over the country continue to provide massive support to Trump, whose support rate rose from 23% in a recent CBS poll held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27% in a Tuesday poll.
But Carson flew from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoyed support in all population groups by crowding Trump into a group of Republican voters with a higher education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio's governor John Kasich, rolled back with the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10 percent last month to 2 percent now.
Former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas, Mike Haqaby, and Florida Senator, Marco Rubio, together ranked third with 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this recent poll is positive to minus 6%, and the poll was carried out in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's growth in the polls -- showing support for 19% of the Republicans, followed by Trump with 32% of the support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
Because of Carson's growing support last week, Trump made several critical incidents against a former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the campaign shutdown in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of a freshman at Baruch University.
About two years after the college student died during the rite of dedication to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"Pi delta Psi's cousins from Baruch New York University brutally attacked Jang "Michael" Deng during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and did not bring him to the hospital on time, resulting in his death," reported the police.
The officials say that a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound sandpack behind his back was pushed several times while he was trying to achieve his goal by walking over a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the 9-1-1 when Deng passed out, and waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, talking to the police.
However, they took the time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, to ask for advice, as the chief of police Chris Wagner told at the press conference.
"Then the members of the fraternity began to hide their personal belongings, essentially putting the well-being of the fraternity above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
He could not be saved and died the next morning.
According to the postmortem report, Deng suffered some blunt wounds to his head, body and thigh.
"There are too many families that have suffered as a result of rites of dedication, since at least one student has died during them every year since 1970," said Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The brothers and their members must be held responsible, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The jurors in Monrovia have leaned in favour of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with violence against a newcomer and criminal collusion.
"We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has officially or informally authorized all this, it is also hers," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch University has prohibited the association, and the national brotherhood has excluded the local branch.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rate
There will be an increase in the rate, and the bull market will stumble, the bond yield will rise, and the economy will collapse into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take before the offensive and how long it's going to take.
For the economy in particular, history does not explain much about time.
The recess occurred only 11 months after the first rate hike and for a total of 86 months.
The hardness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reactions of the economy and financial assets.
So the U.S. Central Bank administration is so insistent that the investor should not focus on when he starts to raise the stakes, but on how long it takes to adapt.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
After all, however, market players may find that all the fuss about raising rates is exaggerated.
"The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve, with the advent of a global financial crisis, will necessarily be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the money age," said Julian Jessop, head international economics specialist in Capital Economics, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the incremental return of US interest rates to a more normal, but still low, will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here's an overview of how some areas of the economy could react depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, waiting for an increase in interest rates may lead to a period of uncertainty.
If the rate is raised, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It does not seem that stock revenue has slowed down by 12 to 24 months after the first leap, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts recently in a study of the rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
More specifically, the market has changed sharply over the past 35 years -- about 14 per cent -- upwards, remains fairly flat within 250 days (average 2.6 per cent growth), and then, after 500 days, returns to normal conditions with an average return rate of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the principal trade strategy specialist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for security is tending not to become more pronounced at the rate rise stage, and stock revenue is beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve has been placed under conditions which have not existed before and which may accelerate the recess.
Most of the gross domestic product will be in its lowest position ever since the high rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases the rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal annual GDP below 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will last long, while it is only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to Atlantic Fed.
An increase in the rate of such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question of whether or not it's going to be different, reported Deutsche.
The members of the market are prepared to raise the stakes of the Federal Reserve for the whole year, with their views tied to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategy experts and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, futures trade suggests only a 25 percent probability.
"In our 1950 study, all the cycles of the rate rise to date have been in a supercycle of growing financial leverage at GDP that overlaps the peaks leading up to the recess very quickly after the beginning of the recovery," the report states.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recess in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest one the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recess; the record is 35 months, and it has lasted for a total of 74 months and is not over yet.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market is waiting for an increase in interest rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one that is being realized for shares.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will be faster than for shares when the Federal system changes strategic direction.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield changes the vector immediately after the first increase/lower rate in the cycle.
At the end of the increase, bond yields are falling immediately, reports Deutsche.
Strategy experts in Charles Shwab believe that raising the rate will make long-term and short-term bond yields closer, making the curve more flat.
High-profit bonds often behave better in such a climate, although "we're still afraid of yield swings," says a study by Cathy Jones, an analyst of fixed income in Shwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected policy results of the Federal System.
"In addition to increasing the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are signs that the market has set itself up for a more rigid monetary policy," she wrote.
The interest rate for short-term loans has risen, the yield curve has increased more flat, credit fronts have increased, and the volatility has increased, all market characteristics have increased, and the policy of the Federal System has been tightened.
Generally speaking, companies that run their main business in the US will benefit from an increase in interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International debt companies will be worse off because the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world marketplace and their debt more expensive in financial terms.
"The story shows that `quality' shares are more effective than the market within three months after the initial rate increases," said Goldman Sachs analysts in the client report.
The companies with a stable financial situation have been overrun by companies with unstable conditions as a result of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
High capital return companies, as well as low capital stock, have also shown greater efficiency than low-quality shares by an average of 4 (percent) and 3 (percent) respectively.
Duty will be a big question.
High debt companies with a floating rate will lose most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely stock exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
The contributors could also see the returns through higher returns, although experts differ in how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM," claims by Andrew Bingham, a member of parliament from conservators.
Andrew Bingham, a member of Parliament from the Conservatives, criticized the station for "degrading standards"
Proves that it's getting less different from the commercial competitor.
Also directed at BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize was just cut off from the Brits
A parish colleague named Damian Collins, who crashed on The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM," said the leader of the Parliament, urging the broadcaster to prove that it was doing anything that commercial companies did not.
Andrew Bingham, a member of parliament from the Conservatives, also told the BBC leadership that it seemed as if the public radio station was "fucking" and was becoming less and less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems--I don't like using the word "simplification"--but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that came to my mind first, in which you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director General of BBC rejected the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 went far ahead of its commercial opponent when it comes to live music and the education of audiences.
What I'm learning from Radio 3 is not going to find out about classic music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performances and music is not really compared to anyone else.
"It's also really very important, I think, that Radio 3's interest in finding new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the BBC Radio 3 manager, Alan Davey, argued that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past, because British people were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC who had been attacked by commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of Parliament from Tori Damian Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media at an estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because of the lack of originality and characterization?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George participate as judges, was made in a "typical BBC style."
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit in her own stable" the next time she started the entertainment project.
However, he did not consider it necessary to prevent future purchases of The Voice seasons or the use of the money of those paying license fees for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales grew as slow as possible in August, and that could be Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase of 7 per cent in online sales
Last month, there was the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago using mobile shopping devices
The experts are convinced that November's Black Friday might have contributed to deterring waste
For about ten years, virtual shopping has suffered a boom, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs of levelling online sales after recent data have shown only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping costs in August showed minimal growth since they began to be recorded in 2000, rising by only 5 per cent.
The experts say that there are now signs of levelling online sales after the latest data show only a seven percent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the rate of growth in previous years and come back by 2000, they've always found a reasonable explanation," said the Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales had increased three years ago when consumers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were allowed to buy online and that they could do it under any circumstances, like sitting on the couch.
But now it's coming out on the plateau, and you can see the decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowing down of sales.
The experts believe that the customers could refrain from buying on the eve of the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of customers rushed to computers in order to take advantage of the lucrative offers, thus bringing down a number of sales websites.
The experts believe that Black Friday, when customers fight for a good buy, could make people refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over £1 out of every 5 is spent online.
With regard to goods such as television and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in fancy shops in central streets.
Muslims bury those killed on the fall of a tap in Mecca, and the Bin Laden family is punished
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead in the streets, as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the faucet collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the street had flown to bury 29 of the victims who had lost their lives as a result of the collapse of the faucet at the main Mecca shrine.
Dressed mostly in white, those present at the funeral filled the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who had gone on their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed by the holy place, where only a few days earlier the building tap had broken through the ceiling of the Moslem and fell on the parish.
The bodies were issued for funeral, while the King of Saudis fined the construction company belonging to the Bin Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who died in a crane crash at the main shrine were carried down the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Kasim Akram, from Bolton, the Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Moslem with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman declared that the Binladin Group should not have left an arrow in the crane raised when the crane was not running.
The Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press, states that the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English news agency did not report this detail, but reported that the company's leaders were not allowed to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why the tap had fallen into the courtyard of the Main Moslem, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had flown to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the crane's collapse, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and of not properly aligning with the weather service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Mecca Main Mob, as part of the extensive construction done by the Binladin Group.
The Bin-Laden family has been among the close family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has run major construction projects.
The late al-Qa'idah leader, Osama bin Laden, was a traitor's son whom the family had rejected in the 1990s.
The accident occurred with strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people came into the kingdom to engage in pilgrimage, which is required at least once in their lives for every able-bodied Muslims.
Government officials reported that there were still 158 people in the hospital.
The officials ordered the payment of 1 million rials (about 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount was irreversibly crippled.
The rest of the victims will receive half of that.
Chapter B&Q asserts that the trends are due to the existence of East European masters working for small money.
According to Veronique Lori, the British are increasingly employing repair workers.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing

They say the British put hammers and paint brushes aside, and instead hire skilled Eastern Europeans to do work at home.
If you can handle a hammer or finely paint walls, you seem to be a minority today.
Because, according to the B&Q company, the British are still employing masters to do simple homework.
Veronique Lori, the new director-general of the Kingfisher, who runs a network of house-building services, reported that behind this is a substantial supply of skilled skills from Eastern Europe, offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open an additional 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craftsmen's goods and to shut down at the same time 60 B&Q stores.
Mrs. Lori said that she would like to see more women in B&Q shops, as eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women of the weak sex.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
She said that the recent demographic trends, which were marked by an increase in the number of single-woman households that were more engaged in the management of their homes than in the past, could not be overlooked.
Mrs. Lori said, "Our shops still employ mostly men.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Mrs. Lori, one of the five women at the helm of the leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team by getting equal numbers of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the general and financial director.
Mrs. Lori said, "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important matter for us.
It was easy to find suitable women on the board.
After the group took over the costs of shutting down the shops, Kingfisher showed a six-month decline in returns and sales.
As a result, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time to decide on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the Federal Reserve Bank's two-day meeting to discuss the most important decision to raise interest for the first time in a decade.
A survey of 80 economists by Reuters found that just over half of those who thought last week that the Fed would do that now believe that it would wait and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank can move away from zero and start a process of interest rate normalization,” said Angel Ubide, a leading member of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The US economy works effectively, the economic recovery adds billions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the impact that a decision will have on the world economy.
He warned markets that they should be prepared for change, but all the evidence suggests that they are confident that all chances are against it.
The decision will be announced at 8:00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"Open!" are hundreds of refugees at the Khorgos border crossing on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for the settlers.
The asylum-seeker is already beginning to explore other routes to the European Union.
One of them lies across the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
The other through Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some data, buses that carried refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading towards the town of Shidu on the Croatian border.
Drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojša Stepanovic, assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help the refugees, but that its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to be treated humanely.
But that's already a pan-European problem.
It is difficult to solve, and no country in Europe alone can handle it, much less a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian premier Victor Orban is stubborn:
If someone calls himself a fugitive, in Serbia he must complete the necessary documents.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country, because it's perfectly safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already built a 175-tiklyometer fence at the border with Serbia.
Orban does not intend to stop there; he plans to erect the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Maymarakis: "European wants to help us."
Vangelis Meymarakis had been a member of the right-wing government for a number of years, which had led the country to a financial crisis, according to the left.
Now, as a temporary leader of the New Democratic Party, he challenges Ciprus.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist named Euronews.
Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to the European News!
Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by giving up the SIRIZA alliance, but according to the polls, "New democracy" is now as popular as it is.
What has changed in that time?
Vangelis Maymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Ciprus lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
The country is now again suffering from budget deficits and high levels of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Ciprus had banished them.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had an opportunity to evaluate the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises made by Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what really happened.
Day-to-day life had become markedly worse than in January, when the situation had improved, for most Greek citizens.
But you say, if you win an election, you're going to want to join other parties, including SYRlS.
The fact is, as we have learned in recent years, that Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programs have been or are still in operation, political forces and all the ruling parties have gathered together to implement a programme on which they have agreed without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Ciprus and the country's lenders.
If you become the new premiere on Monday, will you abide by this agreement, or will you try to change it at least partly?
We actually voted in favour of Greece's movement along the European path, because we are well aware of the devastating consequences that a country's withdrawal from the EU would have.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, and we have foundations of solidarity, Juncker's package and banking assistance.
All this would have been lost had there not been a contract with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Ciprus's negotiation.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So, if Europe finds that the new Greek government wants to bring order to power in the first year, works rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments made that cannot be met because of what leads to a recess can be renegotiated, but only after a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that, already in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to renegotiate with our lenders, as they await full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their confidence, we must continue the privatization, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to take advantage of EU financing and the greater investment opportunities that we must open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the talks, the Government of Cyprus did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out in our discussions with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farm income.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Ministers of Cyprus had never talked about it.
That is, the Greek Ministers were untrained and ill-informed, and therefore unsuccessfully engaged in the talks and concluded a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you'll soon be at one table with Mr. Junker, Holland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
First of all, I'll explain to them that by the end of 2014 we were trying to best implement the 2012 agreement by avoiding the sharp angles in it.
We have advanced reform.
Of course, we did not have the necessary resolve and speed, but we acted in extreme circumstances.
The market had fallen, and there were no potential customers willing to pay the price that the Greek government had given.
I was then the Speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, and that was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as massive demonstrations outside.
We have managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would have continued to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December Presidential elections.
Euronews: The recent weeks have witnessed a massive flow of refugees across Greece.
What do you think of this situation and the reactions of the European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Maymarakis: The refugees crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after winning elections.
And the reason is that the government of SYRIZA did not act in the way it should.
In such matters, action should be taken in advance, for if the problem hits you, only emergency measures remain.
And that's what we're in now.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZ has in only seven days done more than Mr. Ciprus did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which has received valuable assistance from the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will help to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that have happened to them.
There is a profound humanitarian aspect to this issue, and we will follow the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
A decision must be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Thank you very much.
In the peaceful town of Buddykovka Donetsk oblast, within 24 hours, the police officers of the police department of the region, together with the military counter-intelligence, arrested a suspect who was a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Crevoy Rogue, Dnepropetrov oblast, who had been in the course of the evening of the joint drinking and the conflict that had erupted in the village of the Yasinowat district of Donetchina fired a machine gun at his opponent.
A 22-year-old boy was reported injured in a hospital where he was hospitalized with cross-fired legs.
As explained by Artem Vasitski, the deputy head of the criminal investigation department of the police chief of the region, during the course of the operations, the police officers proved that the figure was involved in another serious criminal offence, the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The officers found that the same day there was a conflict between the suspect and another local resident, resulting in a fatal shot in the man's head.
The Investigative Department of the Czechoslovakia has opened criminal proceedings under the articles “Intentional murder” and “Intentional serious personal injury” of the Ukrainian Criminal Code.
Detainees face up to 15 years' imprisonment.
The figure was arrested and placed in a temporary detention cell and reported to the Donetsk police.
Two inhabitants of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in the colour of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced to imprisonment by a Russian court.
Two more inhabitants of the city were sentenced to a restriction of their liberty.
Novosibirsk has been sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicted persons received a restriction of liberty for 14 and 18 months.
The Court of Novosibirsk of Lenin found four citizens guilty of vandalism against Lenin monuments which were located on the premises of the KDPF and on the Street Tricottage, as well as the monumental complex of the "Monument of Fame".
In the latter case, the Katyusha rocket and tank T-34 were painted.
Remember, on the night of December 12th, in Russia's Novosibirsk, unknowns painted in colour the Ukrainian flag military technology at the Monument of Fame.
The civil wife of the popular Russian actor Yevgeny Gypsy Irina Leonov had a seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newlywed and her mother are feeling good.
Remember, Gypsies and Leonov recently broke up.
Yevgeny refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband for everything and his ambitions.
Yevgeny Zygonov is 36 years old.
He is an actor in the Moscow Theatre of the Artist Peter Fomenco.
It's famous for the movies Walk, Space As a Premonition, Brest Fortress, Otepelle, and Farza.
On September 8, Yevgeny Zygonov was recognized as the "Actor of the Year" and "Man of the Year" in the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
The man who opened the shooting at the University of Delta left a note of apology.
After the shooting and murder of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning -- and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day -- Shennon Lamb wrote a note saying that he "repent" of the first murder and wanted to "return everything back," the authorized authorities reported on Tuesday.
The police in Gothier, Mississippi, reports that a professor of geography and social science at the University of Delta called the 9-1-1 service about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot somebody.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he mentioned that there's a dog in the house who's not going to touch anybody, but probably upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shooting.
When the police arrived at the scene of the crime, they found the body of a 41-year-old woman, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45 years old, saying, "I wish I could get it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday night, when he was surrounded by the police, he killed himself.
University Rector William Laforge reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb had something in mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb was supposed to have an affair between Trentis and Schmidt, the official services on Tuesday reported that there was "no information or evidence" of the "loving triangle".
Prentys was referred to as a "good man" by Sean O'Stine, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stine said he and Trentis had a daughter who was 19 and that she was "consoled."
He added that Trentis and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lyndsey Knowles, which the newspaper SunGrald calls a close friend of Trentis's, the latter worked from home online.
Knowles told me that he had a hunting dog called Lightning and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his relatives on Monday at some point to say "he's not going to prison."
The night the police caught him on Route 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary published on a university site, Lamb received a Ph.D. in education at the University of Delta in spring 2015.
Stars Losing their Happiness
The actor (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), had experienced a number of difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his multi-year life companion, Farrou Fosette, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reported to have suffered from drug addiction and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw from the Manhattan United got out for a few months because of a double break.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a match with the League of Champions, in which Manchester United lost the PSV in Aindhoven.
While the defender is concerned about this, which will prevent him from going to the field for at least six months, Louis van Gul hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during the reckless relapse of Hector Moreno at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty zone.
He was given help on the field for nine minutes and was provided with oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double break and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved to Manchester tomorrow or the afternoon afterward, and then he'll be operated on.
It's awful--the young man came to the Manhattan United at the age of 18, overcame the great difficulty and began playing fantastic, and this happened.
He was wearing an Oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's six months, and the guy won't be able to play the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno's lucky he didn't get the red card and he didn't get the penalty.
The Arbitrator of Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged stool.
In his tweets, Shaw says, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how devastated I am, my path to reconstruction begins, I'll come back even more than I was."
On the other hand, the Manhattan United is experiencing a disaster with Luke Shaw in losing the PSV game.
The British defender will have an additional incentive to get back to the European Championship in France next June.
Philip Cocoux, coach PSV, said, "It's a very serious injury."
When any player gets out of this kind of accident, everybody's very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to hurt the enemy.
Moreno had a broken leg when he was playing for Mexico against the Dutch team, led by Van Gal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him now, because he had no intention of wounding the enemy, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, it feels bad," said Coco.
I couldn't see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked like it (Moreno) touched it, but I didn't see a pod like Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to endure.
It's hard and I'm sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smallling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorakes?
Every parent quickly learns one thing: if your child likes a book, it'll take a little while before you get to know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron, apparently.
In response to a question from a representative of a holiday-recreation company about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose the Lorakes, an environmental story written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, and it was written by Cameron in a comment published on the SuperCamps website, and it goes on to say, "This fun, moving, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children because it always shows some sort of image or message that we miss."
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to rewrite the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the same-name film, made in 2012, with new characters and details added, in order to reconfigure a rather short original story.
"In the high walls of the town of Thundernawville, where there was no green and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of audry, the girls of her dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see the real tree," we read in the text a description of the love story unknown to Dr. Seuss Gazelle, who died in 1991.
If this does not seem suspicious enough, the text of Cameron is read almost as a summary of the story of the film "Lorakes", published on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high walls of the town of Thundernawville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girls of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being generally recognized as an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy finds out how a greedy tree cutter and a "numbery" fan of Neodokins are destroying the environment, despite the protests of Loraks (whose name is in the title of the book) -- a funny creature with a moustache that "speaks on behalf of the trees."
It is likely that such a simple PR task was entrusted to an artist who never read a book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street said that the text had allegedly been received from the office of Cameron in the district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron's office, but no further comments were received.
Adam Lit was clearly at risk of not joining the England team, but it's still a difficult question.
Winning Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England picked up for this tour, it's not likely to happen again in the 3-0 test series that happened last time.
I wouldn't rule out winning my field either.
Alistair Cook's team is probably less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are players, virtual ball takers, and collective thinking strongly; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only youthful positives.
With Moin Ali's ball, it turns into a bowler with spinning balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
On the other hand, Adam Lit left England for a test cricket and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to remove Adam Lit to me, his main coach at Yorkshire, is certainly difficult to analyse.
His seven test games had two good attacks under difficult circumstances, and the obvious but violent reality was that cricket players were evaluated by the judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I have said so before) players choose themselves best.
A couple of semi-totals, and Lithuania could have waited for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there'll be another opportunity.
The head coach of the England team, Trevor Baileys, spoke well about his mood, even when he did not show what he could, and it doesn't surprise me; he's first and foremost a team player, and then everything else.
The question is, how long will it take before the test cricket batsman leaves an impression on himself is a difficult question.
Lit played seven games, like Sam Robson before him and Nick Compton at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on a foreign field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean premiere when Lit was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales is showing up, and he's a Batsman, who I value highly.
He's a unpredictable cricket player, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club earlier this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those before him, but this will certainly depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of placing Moen next to Cook as the opening betsman, which would make it possible to introduce an extra spinner by keeping four speed bowlers, is thinking about it, and I don't mind it at all.
I don't see any reason why a batterer can't hit a ball there, and this left-handed guy already shows that he's a damn good cricket player.
Moen may not be exactly what it takes for his County Woostershire, but has become the third number for them, and there's no big difference.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test games with the third betsmen, before he was released as a launcher in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner, and in my brief contact with him he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his rough statistics -- on average, 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky bet, but among spinners, they vote for a little, and they choose youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make some practical additions to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jaiauordin, a Sri Lankan Batsman, as a consultant for the test match could be a masterpiece.
He's one of the best guys for a game that'll bring her the greatest experience that's ever been gained under all possible conditions and any kind of attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and a merciless pace in the seraph.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's a game or a coaching job, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what was said earlier, can give the team new strength.
Colley's team member Durham Ben Stokes is left for a day, Ruth is given a similar break in Australia, and I have no problems with that, for example.
Though not everyone would agree, coaches and players don't set a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
The UK exit camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived policy of resuming the British talks in the EU has become more and more difficult every day, even without looking back at the selection of the brilliant Jeremy- "Is it true or not?"- Corbin's leader of laborists or the TUC's resentment about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Novel Farajis.
A friendly European diplomatic explained recently that, under the current situation of the EU, which is experiencing a variety of crises -- not all of them their own -- some of the member countries are fed up with the British self-centric agenda of conflicting assignments and disruptive changes which they mostly do not want.
Having met in Brighton for an annual meeting, the TUC decided that he did not want them anyway if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "the selfie program of Dave and George."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are driving around at foreign capitals and at binational sessions, taking pictures of themselves against the background of a famous local monument, a company of local celebrities, or without it, and then coming home and saying they're bringing allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in keeping British external contacts under the Tent of the European Union -- "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin -- suggests that hesitant Ministers and officials in some capitals get to an understanding when they don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the very cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation worsens for her, as it worsens for those who sit in that position, Thatcher, 11 years old, Mitterrand, 14 years old and Kola, 16 years old.
The head of France, Francis Hollande, stood before re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power too.
Poland can soon get a right-wing nationalist government, Spain to the left.
It's hard to see them crawling out of their skin to help the sephi-brits whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK -- which they don't want, too, because most people have similar separatist trends.
So some such Ministers may even plan to issue deliberately useless SNP-style remorse during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to encourage the British withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"Revision was an idea-fix" and "British has received nothing valuable from the resumed talks."
Europeans know what kind of a villain Fleet Street might be, and how sceptical media-magnets are to the EU, unlike Tony Ben's referendum in 1975, which supported our entry into 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnsson, a hardened Euro-opportunist, famous for his "direct EU bananas" by a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In spite of his foolishness, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a small company of tax-protected cheaters, foreign telephone hackers and pseudo-natives who own most of our large newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair was quite the same opinion about them, but he realized that when you're in a cell with a violent gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and keep her from eating you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than to Blair's own opposition to the idea of a referendum, because Blair had adopted principles in favour of the abrogated EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of this.
But the dear Jeremy Corbin, who friendly patted me on my back in Westminster Monday--I told him he didn't have time to spend any more time on me--it seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnock's strategy of the '80s "Bocot Merdock"--a mistake both then and now.
It may take some time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy to interact with the press -- not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marr, on whose couch he was sitting at the Air Force on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditional Ukip tendency and the wider range of "little England's party" among thoris might say "yes."
This is the same thing as Hillary-Benn, but not Bennit-Benn said on radio and TV this week, while his internal boy scout refused to admit that Corbin's appointment of the infamous John McDonnel was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father-father fought hard on TV for not being loyal to his colleagues in the labor cabinet without going too far and losing his position in the cabinet.
Hillary's battle was more appealing.
But the struggle to stay "in any circumstances" -- Benna's phrase -- is not what McDonnel said, nor what J.C. said to the Peers and Members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, in general opinion.
Whatever the democrat and "his boyfriend" Corbin wanted to tell me -- remember, he even touched me -- the discipline of messages remains important in the 24-hour television age seven days a week, especially in the spiral of social networks, the hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's wise to keep Cameron from getting so easily rid of Europe, allowing him to take as due support the labourers during the referendum campaign, as McDonnel said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the main misconception of McDonnelle and Corbin about EU membership, within the "Bennitic" economy of besieged fortress, is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among lefters, for whom narcissism, born of a slight distinction, is a central principle in dogmatic arguments.
As for his misconceptions about Nato - Tom Watson's unmistakably in that J.C. won't agitate for leaving - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on British yields, when it might all be meaningless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government is in power to reduce costs, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at a meeting called the British Influence Security.
Expert criticizes the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
A government-funded agency has stated that cigarettes are 95 percent less dangerous than smoking, and 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, have been reported by researchers.
The experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lansant criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published an important report -- last month's "turn-off point" -- calling it a "comprehensible review of evidence."
But some researchers questioned the validity of the data and pointed to the association of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an article in the Journal of Medicine, Lancet last month criticized the "extremely shaky argument" on the basis of which PHE built its main opinion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers asked whether these statements had “hard or flawless reasons”.
Martin McKee, a lecturer at the European Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a lecturer at the University of Liverpool, said, "Fundamental principle of health care - rules must be based on evidence of efficiency."
They said that the public expected the PHE statements that “the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 percent less dangerous than smoking” were based on a detailed examination of evidence and simulation.
In fact, this emerges from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multicriteria decision analysis model to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McCoy and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose Director was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also confirmed BAT health certificates in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer without mentioning the funding he had previously received from the Philip Morris tobacco company.
No reasonable explanation has been provided for the selection of board members, but there are several known followers of electronic cigarettes, some of whom have also announced funding for the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants have any experience in managing the tobacco industry.
The head of the tobacco direction in PHE also visited the meeting.
A scientific article published by the group “simplely accepts” that there is a lack of “many evidence of the damaging effects of most products according to most criteria”, wrote McKinley and Capewell.
However, none of these links and limitations were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE statements that "there is no evidence at present that electronic cigarettes are expensive, causing children or non-smokers to smoke" were premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being in PHE, said that BMJ applications had previously been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less dangerous than smoking."
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All evidence suggests that health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHA has a clear duty to inform the public of what this evidence proves and does not prove, especially where the public has doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die from smoking-related diseases a year, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
Having made it clear that, while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only cause part of the harm caused by smoking -- we do our tasks before the nation.
Former head of Channel 4 believes that BBC should stop the EastEnders series.
Former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop producing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would have paid a lot for such a successful show as the Soap Opera about Albert's Land.
Johnston observed that licensing fees should be used only to create programs that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing broadcasts of public broadcasts, which are probably only a small part of the audience, on the peak airtime when the competitors have a high-rated show, and on such channels as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the company would like to work more closely with other organizations, he noticed that he had tried unsuccessfully to work with BBC for six years while working at Channel 4.
"I can't help thinking that BBC prepares for launch and broadcasts programs that could show competing companies that don't receive subsidies," he told the members of the House of Lords Communication Committee as part of the BBC investigation.
If you keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good medium- and long-term solution, then the company should only keep those programs that are not released and are not going to be released by other companies.
The Voice show is aired in the prime chair because the creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea of no one else showing it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
"I don't understand why regressive taxes should be used to finance transfers that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is the other; commonly known as their own production.
Other channels would certainly have given up a great deal for it.
I don't understand how this can be a public broadcast.
I don't think it would have lowered the BBC in any way.
The serial entrepreneur Johnsson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of chasing ratings "because of employee ambition and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for a long time."
His comments on the most popular show on BBC echoed those of Sky's Executive Director Tony Ball, who, in his 2003 McTaggart Memory lecture in Edinburgh, offered BBC to sell a series like EastEnders.
Johnson observed that the more low-level public BBC broadcasts "continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate audiences, but the function of the company has been performed, and this can be presented as an argument in the pagan sermons justifying 4 billion pounds of revenue from licensing fees: "Well, of course, we do all these incomprehensible broadcasts that no one is watching."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
With regard to the licensing fee, Johnston told the committee, "I encourage you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the most from it.
Of course, you all think we all think £150 a year is a huge sum, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money, I wonder, they think it's because they don't really watch and listen to BBC.
Former executive director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-examine the mission of Kate in favour of "inform, educate and entertain."
He said that only a small part of the BBC output was now officially classified as educational - he said it was 1% of television content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto of "inform, educate and entertain."
On the issue of partnership, Elstein remarked that BBC should do more in areas such as "Simple concerts" (only a part of them, he said, is shown on TV) and join an alliance with commercial broadcasters to make them accessible for online viewing.
Soogogenics allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves.
The video shows how the nematodes change their direction when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have extracted worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction of movement when they are affected by sound waves, too high to be heard by a human ear.
Pulses are influenced by activation of genetically modified neurons to use membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Also on the subject: Researchers manage brain activity with light
Scientists reported that worms are showing the potential of a new method called "sonogenetics", which is to use ultrasound to infuse certain brain cells, hearts and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Sricant Chalasani, a researcher at the Solque Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this might one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used to treat Parkinson's disease.
The nematodes usually don't react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they were starting to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that bubbles increased ultrasound waves, which then infiltrated worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called the TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasound waves cause these ion channels to open and infuse the cells associated with them, as reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to create a nematode that can be manipulated by ultrasound, Chalasani has made a genetic modification of worms, so their engine neurons have used ion channels TRP-4.
During the application of ultrasound to modified organisms, sound waves were enhanced with microscopic bubbles and introduced into worms by activating modified engine neurons.
This method is similar to that used in "optogenetics" -- a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with light pulses.
Chalasani claims that there may be some advantages to sonogenetics in comparison with this method.
Unlike the light brought to the right part of the brain by the fiber optic, low-frequency ultrasound waves flow easily through the body tissue, so you don't have to go inside the skull box to deliver them.
"We believe that in order to treat some neurological diseases in a clinical environment, the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses will temporarily make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal," said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the method could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Forbidden torture equipment, right on your doorstep!
Advertisements are mocking the British arms trade
See the Amnesty International video with a protest against the arms exhibition.
Incredible killers!
Destroying iron chains!
Cassette bombs!
Electric light-noise truncheons that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
A timid voice and a drawn animation leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition is a savage parody prepared by the Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to push weapons into repressive regimes by using an exhibition of defence technology and security in the center of the ExCeL in Dockland.
On the subject: DSEI Arms Expo: Authoritarian regimes going to London
But a special campaign has also led to the sudden emergence of many posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which require another look at them.
"The important announcement going on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them in the London subway fonts, with the image of the DLR line, which becomes a tank silhouette.
In September this year, a crowd of arms merchants will come to the DLR line. The passengers are being asked to help prevent the arms exhibition.
300 banners were painted by artists who posted their works at the "Museum of Hard Design" in Banksy Park "Dismaland".
A collection called Special Patrol has helped to spread them around London by using a "advertiser set", a six-pound set of wrench keys, which is said to "provide access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stops on the planet".
London's transporters don't have fun with such "vandalism" in the form of unsanctioned posters.
One of the ads issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and teacher at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and eager to bring political art to the audience outside the gallery.
Many artists are starting to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another anti-arms exhibition poster greeting passengers in the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by a pro bono VCCP with a graphic designer and an artist who also works free of charge.
The creative director of VCCP, Matt Lever, was struck by the advertisement silence around the arms exhibition -- with an excel laissez-passer -- and thought, "Let's put them on a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought of creating a more realistic and clever corporate advertisement, but "to fill it at home with bright colors and animation has turned out to be more exciting."
"They've been incredibly helpful in drawing attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British government to take measures and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art of arms exhibition comes from the inside of ExCeL, where participants trade fantastic euphemic products.
In a press release, the Saab released an order for "AT4CS RS to shoot off the shoulder" from the U.S. military.
It includes "no analogue cumulative weaponry which results in an incredibly insurmountable armoured operation inside the target".
No matter what he does, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules for living in student dorms
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student's dorm as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral reliability, but only now do I remember the strained smiles of those I irritated -- and numerous, long complaints against others.
Basically, what I've learned can be sorted out by eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can vary from a little nervous to a totally frightening one.
He makes people talk about where you came from, whether you took your academic vacation and where you spent it, whether you support Corbin, and why you "honestly love or hate Marmite," because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract from HAHA, I'll be there."
Take a break.
And help others take a break too, ask questions and show interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, rather than people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they would hand out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking institutions, midnight movies and common parties, but they are also the place where people dress and fix underwear.
And on the subject: Don't even think about starting university when you're in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a shelter, but many dorms form a culture of crowding from one room to another, thus facilitating friendship, communication and a long friendship.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to regain strength.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to go away, and I can restore the energy that I've spent on communicating with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of communicating -- and not knocking on to him, but sending a text.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
One of the guys in my dorms followed this principle: if the door wasn't locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
Since you're starting university life at the peak of the bake-off show, knocking on people's door to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies is no longer such a strange thing, it doesn't look like the 1950s with their "welcome, we're neighbors, I made you something, and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering home meals is a great way to be friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to chat with you, and eventually your face will probably be associated with their pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly blinded piles of flour, sugar, and fat will rather make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student dorms.
Of course, embezzling someone's chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to take a little milk for tea?
Deal with the milk owner.
He'll probably ask you not to be ashamed, even if there's rage in the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's irritating, and I feel sorry for you--but try to treat this adult more than my neighbor, who poured in her milk a dishwasher's fluid to avenge the one who took it without asking.
She's in prison now.
You must not make noise that prevents people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're the people in the saying about glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbour to slow down the sound of the drum and bass gitars, because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor responded by increasing the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5:00 a.m., she kindly let him sleep for two hours, and then shut her music and locked the door behind her, leaving for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband lived in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, would it not be extreme, before biteing elbows, awkwardly, if you took a neighbour for your future husband, interested in him, broke up a relationship and had to see him every day, and perhaps watch him drag all your common friends to his side?
Of course, you can't tell your heart, but if a hot neighbor is not exactly your future husband, try to cool down your own passions a little.
At that exciting moment, when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between play and harassment is thinner than it looks.
A good joke is fun, but it turns into the opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something--but never pack somebody's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the other person's door and put the keys in a glass of water which you'll then put in the freezer--but don't stick the other person's stuff with Blu-Tack to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to install the new operating system on the iPhone after the Apple update
You can request a new operating system by logining into the Setings application to select General and then -Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download it and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error report appears telling them that "Renewing the application failed".
To avoid this, users are recommended to either wait until the rejuvenation has subsided or try to update via iTunes.
Phone tips will allow you to complete the process.
The process may include removing applications to increase space, but Apple has minimized the probability of this action by reducing the amount of updating and has also made it easier with a special tool that suggests removing applications and re-establishing them after completion of the process.
You need to make sure that when you update your phone, your phone is loaded or next to the charger to prevent the battery being deactivated.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop updating, as decommissioning of the phone may result in a failure.

Washington responded by telephone to Russia's military activity.
US secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support provided by Moscow to President Assad only contributed to the exacerbation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is still not going to talk to a Russian colleague about it, writing PJ Media.
US secretary John Kerry called the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“The secretary of Kerry has made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad creates a risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict and has a negative impact on our common goal of combating extremistism, unless we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through the direct transfer of power,” said the US State Department.
They also pointed out that Kerry had once again underlined the US's commitment to fighting the Islamic State in a coalition of over 60 countries.
He also pointed out that President Assad would never be a member.
Moreover, the US “will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in attempting to resist the Islamic State”.
Last Friday, the White House said that they did not know exactly what the Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was about to discuss the matter with Moscow.
Meanwhile, White House spokesperson Josh Ernest said that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Poetin had not come: "When the President decides that a telephone conversation with President Poetin will be in our interest, then he will pick up the phone and try to make that call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase its support for Assad's "lost bet."
I remember our conversation with Mr. Poetin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake that Assad's continued support would only worsen the situation.
"But he did not heed my warnings -- and as a result the situation got worse," said the President of the United States.
Imported boats will be freed from the payment of Customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intended to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating facilities for leisure and sport from the payment of duties and taxes.
Changes to the list of temporary duty-free goods have been prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported by the Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Helena Lashkin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, on his visit to Crimea, directed a number of agencies, such as the Mineronomy, Mintrans, the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the FSB, the FTS, the Russian Federation and the Russian Federation, to prepare proposals to create an enabling environment for yachting in the coasts of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of boats.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad, about 200 million go to the treasury of European States every year for maintenance, repair and maintenance of boats.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission “On the introduction of changes to the list of goods temporarily imported with a complete conditional exemption from the payment of Customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating facilities for leisure and sport.
In the view of the Ministry, this would certainly contribute to creating an enabling environment for the development of the yachting in the country's coastlines, lashkin remarked.
The matter was submitted to the Sub-Commission on Customs, Non-Trift and Protection Measures in External Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and the discussions were also endorsed by the agencies.
As the representative of the Ministry of Environment and Development had pointed out, the proposed measure of full conditional release on import was inherently a benefit.
Therefore, after the adoption of the minutes of the meeting of the Sub-commission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EEEC member States, explained by Lashkin.
The list of imported goods, which are completely free from the payment of duties, taxes, includes goods necessary for the promotion of foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in science, culture, film, sports and tourists, for international assistance, etc. These include service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), monitors, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and craftsmen, water skis, racing cars, motorbikes, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and religious objects.
In the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, "Ivestiyas" reported that binding orders had been issued on the seaports of Kerci, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatoria, which provided for a simplified procedure for the entry and exit of small, sporting sailing and pleasure craft into the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has given instructions to the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure that small, sporting sailing and pleasure craft enter the seaport and exit the listed ships from the seaport.
Mintransom has also prepared draft regulations for the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the waters of the seaports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Theodosia, orders had already been issued; the rest were in the process of being agreed upon, as indicated by the press service of the department.
According to Mintrans, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol are required to carry out State registration, classification and inspection with respect to small craft used for non-profit purposes.
The problem is that in Russia the yachting is extremely difficult precisely because of the weak infrastructure.
If you look south of Italy and France, it's an entire ever-growing industry where a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, however, everything actually stands still.
Our coastline is a little interesting, the only piece where you can exploit boats all year round is the Black Sea in Sochi, Gelenjik, Novorussia, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that in this area the border police rules are extremely strict: in order to go for a walk on the yacht, a lot of permits have to be issued.
Besides, there's no place to refill a boat inside Russia.
For two days she can go with her fuel, and then there's a problem where to get it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
With regard to boat storage sites, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special anchorages for boats up to 30 metres. The boats are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany for storage.
Novikov remarked that yacht purchasers were rich people, but the demand for yachts declined with the start of the crisis.
The World Bank has provided Ukraine with a $500 million loan.
The World Bank has approved a new $500 million loan project for Ukraine to develop the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of an international organization.
"New funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," states the report.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Simeo Fan, said that reform of the banking sector would help restore credit to the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken remarkable steps to reform the economy and that the World Bank was witnessing the first signs of stability.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, the Fan has called on the Ukrainian government to accelerate reform.
Earlier, the Polish government had approved a loan to Ukraine's Y100 million, and was broadcasting "RlA News."
In prisons, people are asked to create separate units for transgenders.
At the Public Council of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of convicted persons in October 2015, among other matters, the possibility of creating separate colonies for transgenders and transvestites will be discussed.
Councilman Vladislav Grib told us about this.
In his view, depending on the total number of convicted persons in Russia who had not been convicted with sex, it was possible to provide for separate cells, blocks or even (if there were many such criminals) in domestic prisons to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib points out that it is only possible to determine whether citizens are sentenced to such isolated places after the convicted persons have received appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the perpetrator is indeed a person who identifys himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
He said that the proposed practice had been successful abroad: the SIZO (where the accused were pending trial) had separate cells for transgender persons and the detention facilities had special units.
Today, it's the only way to work with such criminals.
They must certainly be isolated, as the presence of transvestites and transgenders in ordinary cells is dangerous to them; it is suffering for their families and a sea of trouble for FSIN employees.
The humiliation of the trances on the part of the cellmates is guaranteed,' said Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large a city is and how many criminals with uncertain sex, you have to figure out where to put them.
There's definitely no need for separate cells -- only cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgenders.
As the Gryb explained, the block may contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is set up alone in Russia, transsexual prisoners will be able to go there from any region.
Citizens are held in the SIZO at the place where the crime was committed, so the arrival of transvestites or transgenders from other entities during the investigation and trial process is not realistic, but to introduce such a practice for convicted persons in a separate colony - yes, the Gypsy considers it.
Remember, the previous day, law enforcement officials had not been able to determine in which detention facility, male or female, was held for possession of drugs by 24-year-old transsexual Dmitri Kojukov (known as Aline Davis), which prevented the arrest of a man with a girl's appearance.
He was released home on a non-exit subscription.
This news has been widely debated in social media and media, as the mechanism for keeping transgender people in SIZOs and colonies in Russia does not yet exist.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alexeyev supported the idea of creating special places for transgender prisoners, noting that abroad it is also possible to identify persons in a colony - male or female - depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of prison security for homosexuals, says Alexeyev.
The prisons must be safe, so separate blocs could be made for this and homosexuals, especially since there are more in prison than transgenders.
However, Alexeyev doubted that there would be many citizens in Russia who would be willing to pretend to be transsexuals in order to get into a different colony.
Of course, you can introduce a medical examination before you put people in a colony for transgender people, but not always everything is certain.
In the United States, for example, one of the inmates of Chelsea Menning looked like a man, and already in prison he said he wanted to change sex, said Alexeyev.
A person can feel like anything.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve sentences for transgender people, I doubt that prison officers will seriously think about the safety of such people and take into account the subtleness of their orientation or sexual identity.
At the same time, the international reproductive health expert in the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, said that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender criminals in the colony could significantly delay the beginning of the sentence.
A commission is being set up -- it's a matter of sexology, and psychiatrists do long periods of observation, and it's not the only test on which a very precise conclusion is made.
Today's opportunities for psychiatry make it possible.
So, even before sex change, potential patients are always tested -- they exactly show whether sex change with surgical interference is the necessary measure,' says Lordshiponidze.
However, it is hard for me to imagine how this system should be implemented in relation to convicted persons, since it takes on average a month to do so.
The doctor, although generally supported the idea of creating separate blocs for transsexuals, also doubted whether it would be advisable to invest in the current economic environment in building new premises, medical examinations, transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it can be said that transgender people are even smaller, and those who have such a deviation and commit crimes are very few, said Lordship.
At the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender persons can already obtain separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the world championship for chess.
In Hunte-Mansburg, the world chess championship was completed for young people under the age of 20.
The end of the predominance was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and became a Russian, Michael Antipov, who was still able to catch up with the Polish Ian-Kshištof Doudoo, who seemed confidently going to the title.
The girls were celebrated by the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Bux.
The World chess championship in Hunte-Mansburg, which had been held since early September, seemed to have lost almost all its intrigue by the middle of the tournament, as the Polish representative Jan-Xischtof Douda, who had issued a series of four victories (the competitions were held on the Swiss system in 13 rounds), was firmly taking over leadership.
Given that Douda was the top-favorite rating, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would miss the break was very low.
And even when Douda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the gap to only 0.5 points, he remained the obvious favorite in the title struggle.
Because Antipov had to win the 13th round to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help if Dud had won his party.
Plus this requirement of victory, of course, could affect the Russian chess player's game and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He did well with Francesco Rambaldi, and then he had to wait for his party to complete the Duda meeting with Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately for Antipov, a Polish chess player brought up a fight with a Dutchman in spite.
So Antipov and Douda got an equal number of points -- 10 out of the 13 possible points, but the Antipov had the best extra scores.
And so it's to him that the leadership of the Huntia-Mansian Atomic District, whose governor, Natalia Komarov, has traditionally paid a great deal of attention to the development of chess in the region, has given a major prize.
But in the girls' competition, the intriguing ending didn't happen.
The leader of the tournament, Natalia Buxe, Ukraine, was enough not to lose in the last round to win the title, which she did successfully.
So the victory of the Russian woman, Aline Bivol, prevented her from catching up with Bux.
The Russian sports woman remained the second with 0.5 points behind the champion.
The squirrel changes the regional structure.
The company brings together the Occupy and the Ural regions in one large Wallsko-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East region in the East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As Wimpelcoma's president, Michael Slobodin, has pointed out, the changes are being made to “maintain a strong market player” and to develop a company “in a new, not always favourable external environment”.
In an interview with "Russia 24", Mr. Slobodin explained that they intended to reduce the "ten percent" of the staff in Russia.
Rosneslavnadzor verified 78 Moscow Burger King restaurants and issued a total of 187 orders.
As a result, a restaurant on the Volokolam highway was fined 50,000 roubles, and a restaurant on the Grand Tull Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all the abuses had been resolved.
43 restaurants broke the requirements for the space.
Among other breaches, poor health and health facilities, non-observance of the ventilation system, some institutions have found a microbial group of intestines.
Franchise for Burger King's brand is owned by the Burger Rus, the owner of Alexander Kolobov's Chocolate Network, and has 293 restaurants in Russia.
Igor Artemiev, head of the FAS, said that the agency was against the 10 per cent indexation of shipping and State subsidies, as requested by the OAO RZD.
At first they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and they want multibillion dollar subsidies from the budget, he says.
We say it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, abandon expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS had its own, "more severe" suggestions, which were currently being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement with the Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of a $300 million worth of shares, a gold-mining company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the value of the Sumeru shares and market quotations) which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to execute the option or to request additional payment.
The details of the Polymetal talks do not reveal.
The option was made as part of the purchase of the "Kisil" Polymetal project in Kazakhstan.
Nickita Stassin, director of the Ministry's Department of Housing Policy, reported that the Ministry, together with the BC, was developing a policy for the approval of developers.
"We understand that it's not going anywhere, so we're developing an appropriate mechanism," said the official.
The drafts of the "Citizen Kane" movie will be put on the market.
The representatives of the Profiles in History auction house announced their plans to put on the market a commercial version of the "Citizen Kane" film, which is considered one of the best works of the director, writer and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will start in Calabas on September 29, with three drafts of the script presented, the estimated value of each of them being $20,000 to $30,000, and the AP will be presented.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankewitsch, is the earliest scenario in private collections and is called "American," a working title that the film had.
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final design of the film.
Minprompt: Targeted food aid will not be the same as cards in the USSR.
The Russian deputy minister of industry and trade, Victor Eutukhov, said that the targeted food aid programme would not be the same as the USSR food distribution card system.
These are modern targeted food assistance to the population and support for an efficient domestic product.
I'm asking you not to speculate on a food card.
I should like to note in particular that there is no need to confuse the product cards offered with a glimpse of past total deficits, a card distribution system where the number of products received is normal.
We have so far suggested a concept, if approved, we will propose changes to the law,” the TASS quotes Mr. Eutukhov.
Previously, OSL wrote that a food card program for the poor has been introduced into the government.
For more information on the Minprompromprogue initiative, see the "Oz" "Igor Shuvalov has asked you to prepare your food cards."
The president of Rosgosstraha wants to divorce his wife.
The source informed RAPSI that the president of Rosgosstrach's insurance company, Danil Hachathurov, had filed an application with the Moscow Court for the termination of the marriage with the designer of Uljana Sergienko.
The trial division of the justice of the peace, number 100, will commence on 16 September.
Danil Hachatururov is asking to terminate his marriage and share his property.
The court confirmed that there was a case for divorce in the proceedings, noting that the division of property had not been filed and would be tried by the District Court.
Alexander Bobreshov, President of the RZZZ, is leaving his post.
Alexander Bobreshov, USO Vice President of the Russian Railways (RZD) for corporate security, leaves the company, reports Interfax, citing the source.
The Vice-Premier of Russia, Arcadius Dvorkowitsch, President of the Board of Directors of the RZD, said that the issue of leaving the RZD by Alexander Bobresov had been initiated by the new head of Oleg Belarus.
According to the vice-premier, the human resources changes in the management of the RJD are not related to the change of head of the company.
Previously, OSL reported that instead of Vladimir Yacunin OAO, the RJD was headed by Oleg Belozer, the first vice-secretary of transport, who had been in charge of the financial bloc.
The new head of the company announced for the first time reforms in monopolies: within a year and a half a new system of charges will be created.
For more information on the transformation of the company, see "OS" for "RZZ will rewrite the values".
This year, a study by the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is published for the 16th time.
As a tool to evaluate the professional reputation of Russian top-level managers, the study takes stock of the work of Russian managers over a year, identifying leaders in industry and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of last year's ratings.
Last year's winners were invited to confirm their participation as candidates for this year's rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list is invited to nominate up to 10 new managers from other companies, who would be usefully added to the pool.
It is possible to nominate the following directors of the company's functional areas: a financial director, a commercial director, a marketing director, a staff director, an IT director, a director of public and corporate relations, a director of government relations, and a director of corporate management.
Each expert's manager is invited to participate in the ratings and is given the opportunity to move up to 10 new managers from other companies.
Nominations are based on the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: Information Technology, Commercial Banks, Forest and Forest Processing, Engineering, Media, Metallurgy, Multidimensional Holding, Professional Services, Communications and Telecommunications, consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmacy, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each attendee is provided with a login and password to log in to www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the rest of the participants and can provide their estimates on the criteria suggested for each function.
The rating method is based on the "best choose the best" principle: top managers evaluate top managers, function managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle allows for the most authentic evaluation of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All interested candidates for this year ' s ratings and multiple candidates for previous years ' ratings are invited to attend face-to-face meetings of the expert commissions.
The commissions are organized on the basis of functionality: the board for the approval of the list of top managers and the eight commissions for the approval of heads of functional areas.
The meetings of the expert commissions are requested to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (the places are kept strictly in accordance with the Internet assessment and are classified until the rating is published) or to make updates to them in accordance with the attached list of stand-by candidates.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the Russian language rules and the "JO" rules.
At the time of publication of the rating, there are possible changes in the status of managers and companies.
Comfort rate for investment is 10 to 13%.
According to experts, the small and medium-sized business credit market in January/April of this year is 40% low.
What are your estimates of the situation today?
After the panic of late 2014 - early 2015, BMS credit declined significantly.
The reason is clear: sharp interest rate increases.
Loans at 25 to 30 percent per year were of no use to anyone.
If previously the bank could place all its possible problems on a higher stake, from delay to non-return, it is now impossible to do so: the stakes are already cloudy.
For the business, the current rate of interest on the IMS is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is not cost-effective.
A rate of 10 to 13% would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns.
How do you estimate that the demand for credit by employers is being met?
The situation has improved a little since the interest rate of the CB was reduced.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients began to apply for credit much less frequently.
Above all, business does not understand its prospects for development and future incomes.
Today, business has one option: to learn to work on the basis of the current economic situation in the country and region.
There is a need to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor cash flows.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment and reduce production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately enables the company to make the product more competitive and to keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What major trends in the BMS credit market will be enhanced and will affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast of a lower average rate will depend largely on the Central Bank policy, and the controller is now showing sequencing in terms of lowering the key rate.
However, a radical fall in the price of credit for the UXO is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, inflation is a problem that makes it necessary to increase the interest rate in order to generate real income.
Moreover, the value of money in Russia will remain high even if the price of the CB is reduced.
With regard to the level of delay, traditional small- and medium-sized business companies, which are limited in both cash and economic behaviour adjustment options, will certainly pose a greater risk to lenders.
I wouldn't expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad credit.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is written in Japanese characters.
It's beautiful, cunning, and at the same time difficult for those who get used to Cyrillic or Latin.
And so the new CX-5 crossover, like any other brand model, is, without fancy, attractive from the outside, technically perfect inside.
Japanese is already simply because of its Japanese nature, capable of bringing about attachment to the products of the rising sun to a state of complete admiration.
You can make all the arguments you want for cars from other countries, and you'll even agree with them in principle, but the whole conversation comes from the final phrase, "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people probably should love not only technology but all the other Japanese.
Quoting from Basque's walk, fixing the wasabi's food, collecting the catanas and dressing your girlfriend--no, not in kimono, of course, but on the pavement of Japanese street fashion: nice, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps Japanese school uniforms are the only form girls have ever worn after school.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But the new picture of the car and the rear lamps, on which the car will instantly be recognized in the flow of cars, makes a much greater difference in the shape of the car.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks quite tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensitive, but the appearance is strict.
You don't have to call the police.
In driving CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can only experience a stoic Japanese calm.
The 2.2 litre diesel engine provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine of 175 litre is only 5.9 litre. The power train is assembled with a purely automatic transmission and full drive.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
To add a bit of black humor to this image, you can select leggins with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
However, the Mazda did their best to prevent you from driving a CX-5 accident.
To further improve comfort, while maintaining excellent control, the capsules were rebuilt with the design of the front and rear depreciation devices, as well as optimizing the shape of the front lower arm.
The full drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise from road and engine at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
The flower or strip shop is as boring as the budget sedan.
It's different if a girl wears a bathing suit with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of a role fighter.
Then she'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both front and rear seats, which provides the best space for both broad shoulder and long foot, which is what you have.
And the long legs will probably appreciate that the edges at the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the expression.
The largest set of active Mazda security systems is offered on CX-5.
This uses radar, lasers, and cameras to detect a potential threat.
There's both adaptive lighting here, and warning about the landing from the strip, and monitoring dead areas, and safe stopping.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the classroom.
Comfortable, having the minimum projections, it contains a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are composed in a ratio of 4:2:4 - with each section fitted with a separate drawbar - and extend the baggage compartment to 1560 litres.
The Japanese cartoon hero's suit is called "kigurums".
It looks particularly fancy to me.
You can do anything about it!
Of course I'll sleep.
But also entertaining little kids.
Or just walking around like that in the street...
I mean, it's so great to be able to choose -- cool clothes, behavior, or a car.
Thank you for helping Kawaicat prepare the material.
Kiev tore up the atomic unit.
Kiev has officially formalized Ukraine's non-cooperation with Russia on the development of the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant.
On Wednesday, since the second attempt, the Supreme has voted to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
The arrangements for the third and fourth blocs were signed as early as 2010 - 2012, but the project could not be started.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law abolishing the agreement concluded between 2010 and 2012 with the Russian Federation to build a third and fourth block on the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant.
The bill submitted by the Government had been passed only after the second vote, for the first time with a minimum of 226 members, but 234 members of Parliament had voted in favour of it.
The original Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant, which was built under the USSR, was to have four power units of 1 GW with reactors of the type of WWEE, but only two were built.
The reconstruction talks with Moscow had led to an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and the Council had passed laws in 2011 and 2012 respectively.
Since there were no funds in the Ukrainian budget, it was assumed that the building of blocks would have to be borrowed from the Russian side, but the funds had never been allocated.
Following the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling between the two countries, Kyiv began to terminate relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, refusing to work on the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area in which the relationship remained was the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for operating Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the electricity generation in the country), as the Ukrainian NAEC “Energoat” had not yet replaced Russian supplies.
The plans to build Khmelnitsky's nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been completely abandoned, and talks with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev in 2014.
UN Hensec against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported during a press conference that there was no military solution to the situation in Syria.
"There is no military solution," quotes the AP's answer to a question about Russian military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also announced that he would meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I'll meet with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be about Syria," he said.
Earlier today, the Russian military deputy chief of staff, Nikolai Bohdanovski, reported that the General staff did not rule out the possibility of creating a future military base in Syria.
No such plans yet.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bohdanovsky.
Formerly, the U.S. reported that it did not trust Russian President Vladimir Poetin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the Russian-prohibited terrorist group the Islamic State.
For more information on US doubts about Syria's Russian aid, see the "OS" "The Russian military presence in Syria worries Washington."
In the PA, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSOC) reports a possible meeting of Ukrainian and Russian Parliamentarians.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the parliamentary assembly (PA) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Arthur Herasimov, reported on the possibility of a two-year meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in south-east Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is scheduled this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," the TASS quotes Mr. Herasimov.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk Accords and for “return to the normal activities of our countries”.
On the question whether, in his view, a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the “normal” or in the form of a contact group on the OSCE PA site - was currently possible, Mr. Herasimov observed that the dialogue had been held, there were Minsk Accords.
At the same time, politics says that in Kiev there are all types of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, the former President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, had said that the self-proclaimed Republics of Donets and Lugono had not changed their positions in the trilateral talks in principle yet, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given a mandate.
Yesterday, the Bas-Novgorod Election Commission summed up the city duma elections for the municipal district by assigning the 12 seats that had been allocated by party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of election abuses have been made by the PRRA representatives accused of “falsification” with an axe.
The opposition ' s comments were not accepted.
In addition, the Russian Communist Party refused to organize a referendum on the lifting of the rent for the reconstruction of multi-family houses.
The city bench officially presented the results of the elections in the proud Lower Novgorod district.
A total of 1.03 million voters were included in the Bas-Novgorod voters ' lists, 746.7 thousand votes were issued to the district commissions and 268,000 votes were cast.
More than 11.7 thousand votes were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were allocated to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the "One Russia" lists, six deputy seats in the gordum are held by Dmitry Swatkovski, Dmitri Krasnov, Basili Shopranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Viacheslav Rasteriaev and Igor Nagor.
The party leader Vladimir Zhirinovski received the only mandate.
The two PRRA terms are distributed between Vladimir Boulanov and the deputy of State Duma Alexander Tarnayev.
The three terms of reference of the Fair Russia are given to Alexander Reasonovski, Igor Bohdanev and Michael Shaluguin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether or not they will be serving as councillors in the city: if they withdraw from their terms of reference, they will turn to the next candidate on the desk.
The chairman of the oblast committee, Alexander Makeev, informed the commissioners that he was in the process of setting up a "small of Girinovski's cables and so on" service for the purpose of renouncing their mandates.
At the time of the adoption of the election protocol, the representatives of the CPRR reported multiple abuses.
Leonid Krasnokutski, a member of the assembly board with the right to vote, suggested not to accept the results of the vote in four districts No. 2124, recalling that, by order of the head of the administration of the Sormov district, the entrance to the administration building, where the four district commissions were located, had been closed.
Neither state councillors nor the candidates themselves nor the observers could go through the interior for a long time, and the resounding scandal of storming the door of the administration was shown on TV.
All observers and members of the commissions, with the right to vote, were able to attend the meetings of the District Commissions.
The head of the team stopped access only when the vote was over and the district commissions had not yet arrived to deliver their votes.
This was done with a view to preventing various forms of incitement.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and interested persons were able to attend all the meetings," a member of the Natalia Andrewshin bulge was parsing.
The Communists objected that, in the blocked administrative building, the deputy of the district assembly of Ludmillo Aristov had been held illegally for over four hours, on which a complaint had been submitted to the investigation committee.
The opposition also resented the fact that, on election day, a number of PECs began sealing up boxes at 6 to 7 a.m. by posting early-election ballots.
At the same time, the commissioners with the right to vote and observers were not notified, so they had already arrived at the beginning of the election at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning before the opening of polling stations, the ballot papers could be thrown unchecked into the urns.
However, the mountains, which had already examined more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any infractions with the drops of unaccounted votes.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of a colleague from the Fair Russian Federation, Mary Popov, by means of an licker, to withdraw the amended regional legislation in order to make clear the time of opening the envelopes with the early voting sheets, which would then be placed in the urn.
"Go to the CEC as your own initiative," advises Mrs. Popo Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, the President was struck with a loud charge by a member of the PRRA, Sergey Samahin, who shouted that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered the election.
"You're not here at the rally, please be careful to announce!" the chairman of the beaker offended.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimity.
By 27 September, the bench is expected to approve the overall results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the Bas-Novgorod 6th City Duma will be scheduled within three weeks.
In addition to the results of the elections, the City Election Commission refused to register the political party “Communists of Russia” for the holding of a local referendum.
According to the documents, the party was going to bring to the lower city two questions: do they agree that the rents for apartment buildings should be “continuously cancelled” and that the rents for residential services should be “freeze by 2020”.
However, the lawyer of the Duma of Irina Maslova explained that the application of the Russian Communists was contrary to the law.
The FedEx revenue is mixed, decreasing projections for 2016.
FedEx reported the discouraging results of the last quarter, and the delivery services giant reduced the forecast of annual returns due to a fall in demand for shipping services and an increase in the costs of its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it intended to hire about 55,000 season workers for holidays.
At the same time, FedEx reported last year that he would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares increased by about 2.5 per cent in pre-bid tenders 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp stated that he intended to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year that ended next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast decreases despite an average increase of 4.9 per cent, which will come into effect on 4 January, and an increase in charges for the ground transport of heavy or large-scale goods, which begins in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase revenue from last year by reducing costs, raising gross income and increasing online trade.
The President and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company had “worked steadily in view of the weaker economic conditions than predicted, especially in production and world trade”.
Job plans for holidays were announced the day after the application of the competitor, UPS, that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same number as they did last year.
For the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, an increase of 6 percent over the previous year.
The share income was $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 for a stock investment research survey conducted by 12 analysts.
The income rose by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered a decline in the international transport sector in recent years, resulting in a lack of growth of gross income in its rapid transport division.
However, the Internet buy-in boom has greatly improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport revenue increased by 29%, but operating revenue remained unchanged owing to increased costs of large shipping and self-insurance.
The express transport unit earned higher income because of higher base costs, while in the cargo sector income fell due to higher labour costs.
In the pre-bid bids, about an hour before the opening of the exchange, FedEx shares dropped by $3.85 or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday by 11 percent a year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in a few years, the leaders of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from Honduran redwood, considering whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end the rich decorated meeting room, two floors above it, will hang a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues should place the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank received a double call from the Congress: to maximize employment in the US and to keep the prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third, unwritten commission: financial stability.
And this third commission may be an unknown factor in the almost anticipated Thursday decision to announce whether the US economy is ready to avoid the unprecedented incentive provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Even though most of the data show strong growth in the economy, recent upheavals in the global financial markets can deter already cautious leaders from adding volatilism by raising the base rate on federal funds -- even by a quarter percent point.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lyndsey M. Piegza, the main economist of the Stifel Nicolaus & Co Brokering Company.
"But I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait on," she remarked.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which itself triggers financial market swings.
About half of the economists recently surveyed Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to withstand this, with a key indicator showing only about 30 per cent probability of a rapid recovery.
This may lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that decision-makers do not soften the blow of the promise that the next increase will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to 16,599.85.
The takeoff was prompted by expectations that the people defining the strategy of the Federal System would leave the bet this week,' said John Lonski, the main economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It would be a surprise if the Federal System would raise the stakes at this point in time," he remarked.
If the management of the Federal Reserve does so, "they'll have to go far in asserting their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don't panic."
Other experts objected that raising the rate might calm financial markets, as it would remove the uncertainty as to how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in slowly tightening financial conditions, which might prove the strength of US reconstruction.
Yellen stated in spring and early summer that she was expecting a raise this year, despite the complaints from the liberals that more economic progress was needed.
While the emergence of new jobs slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market has been steady this year.
The rate of unemployment declined to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest in over seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal system considers to be full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And, while inflation continues to fall below the annual target of 2% by the central bank, the management of the Federal System said that the key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the contraction of the labour market," remarked Ian Shefferson, the main economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to tremble at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The average Dow Johns index for industrial companies fell by as much as 16% relatively high in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy might slow global growth.
The market has partly recovered its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve System, market disturbances further complicate the difficult calculation of the duration of interest rate increases.
"In the absence of information about what had happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have started to twitch at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior UCLA researcher, Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former member of the Federal Reserve System.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty as to what the effects might be on the US economy, and they have almost no reliable data since the recent events in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal system and should not technically be taken into account when making these decisions.
But in fact, the Federal Reserve has become a global financial power.
The Central Bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
A mere hint from the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013 that the Federal Reserve system can silence its monetary expansion has caused global market upheavals.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it might be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts in order to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process -- "Quite Art Than Science," said Zackary Carabelle, head of the Envestnet Inc., a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Geoffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve there were cases of overreaction to financial market movements which seem not to be related to economic principles."
Loker, a member with voting rights from the powerful Open Market Committee, who insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis has led the Federal System to reduce its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three sessions, “despite the limited identifiable effects on US growth,” said Loker.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System cancelled these cuts.
The federal reserve system should only put stability first in times of great crisis, such as the collapse of the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the interest-rate committee at Bank of England.
The last panic didn't come close to that level, he said.
"You wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're frightened by the rise in interest because markets are shaking," said Pozen, President of the Peterson World Economics Institute.
The law on the Federal Reserve still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be ahead of it.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/compound was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
It's often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai market, which is also traded for the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Tytown.
The market/store is a store where you can buy everything at once, offering a dizzy selection of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian appetizers, kitchens, furniture, religious and holiday ornaments.
There's even a car department if you need to buy oil for the engine.
The store is huge, and it'll take over an hour to sweep all the rows.
If shopping causes you hunger, buy food from LAX-C BBQ Expression.
The cooking department in the store (good and cheap) is close to the cash register and offers various options for taking out.
What do you suggest? Do you need anything--anything-- Thai?
LAX-C probably has that.
Prices for goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold in bulk.

The Speaker of the State Duma, Sergei Narishkin, admits that the US deliberately destabilizes the Middle East so that waves of refugees flow into Europe.
According to Interfax, he gave this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
"I am not a supporter of conspiratory theories, but the question is for myself: Is Europe the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic perseverance in recent years, have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?" he wondered.
"Surely someone thought and knew that the flows of refugees, these miserable and destitute people, who are fleeing from death, would rush to the well-off countries of the EU," he added.
Narishkin asked, "How many political leaders in Europe have spoken out about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is literally flooding their countries now?"
"No, old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he remarked.
According to Narishkin, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is flouting many European values and rules of international law.
"Europa, unfortunately, has long and unbiasedly looked and looked at the way in which military boots, which are tailored to the standards of the North Atlantic, are trampling moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and rules of international law," stressed the speaker.
Government forces and their loyal paramilitaries are opposed by rebels, who are mostly Islamists.
Later, the Russian-prohibited terrorist group “Islam State” joined the enemies of the Syrian government.
The US supports the rebels, who are against both Assad and IH.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
Syria's president mentioned the reason for the West's aversion to Russia.
The Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia, and Iran are actually that they are sovereign States.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, Channel I, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners or sovereign States.
In those countries he wished to remove one person and place another in his place, who would act in the interest of Western countries rather than in the interests of his own country, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of Western media in the wake of the coup in Ukraine.
He said that for them, Russian President Vladimir Poetin had “became from a friend of the West to an enemy, a king, a dictator, who suppressed Russian opposition, which had come to power in an undemocratic manner, even though he had been elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Poetin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West's constant statement that Assad himself should withdraw, he said that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he left, at the request of the people rather than at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, or else he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation was taking place with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
On the subject of military support from Iran, the Syrian leader observed that it supported the Syrian State in politics, economy and military matters.
He denied that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
"Surely there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place," he explained.
As far as the rest of the States are concerned, we are open to cooperation with any one of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terror and anti-Iigil coalition led by the United States," said Assad.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000 and the number of refugees exceeded 11.5 million.
A part of the Territory was seized by a terrorist group called the Islamic State, which is prohibited in Russia.
The U.S.-led international coalition is blowing the air at IH positions.
In Utah, 12 people died from flooding.
In the U.S. state of Utah, at least 12 people died as a result of flooding.
Another is reported missing, passing Fox 13 Salt Lake City.
The water flushed several cars with the people in Washington County.
One of them, the van where the family was staying, stopped in a dangerous zone near the water, and the stream suddenly caught him.
The youngest victim was four years old.
All of the dead are inhabitants of Colorado City and Hilldale, who have been hit by a disaster.
Three children who have been rescued have also been reported.
There are 650 teams involved in search and rescue.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Policy: Peace: Lenta.ru
US secretary John Kerry had a telephone conversation with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov.
Reuters reports this with a reference to the representative of State Department John Kirby.
It is observed that the subject of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any further details.
At the same time, he said that the US had tools for Russia's "further isolation" if it supported President Bashar Assad of Syria, it would send the RlA News.
According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during the conversation with Kerry, Lavrov re-emerged the need to create a united front against terrorist groups operating in that country.
Discussions were also held on how to resolve the Ukrainian crisis and on possible steps to reduce tension on the Korean peninsula.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were raised.
Earlier, United States officials had declared that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and had expressed concern about the increase in Moscow's support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the Russian President's spokesperson, Dmitry Pescove, said that the country would not be in international isolation.
The rebels support the overthrow of Assad's regime.
A part of the Territory was seized by the Islamic State, a terrorist organization.
An international United States-led coalition has targeted the IG positions with air strikes.
The beard called the American newspaper's information a libel against the Arrow.
The former president of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Boroda, denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He announced this in a telephone interview to the Lenta.ru correspondent.
The note in the Washington Post is beautifully because it's totally overturned.
The former Minister of Defence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Igor Smallkov, naturally did not link and "exit" him from the Republics of Donbassa in a very uplifted mood, without ropes, without three furs of money attributed to him by different characters," he remarked.
According to Berothus, the conversation about the shooter with the reporter of the American newspaper was really going on.
"Yes, I said that it was urgent to remove Arrowow from the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The beard stressed that he did not know why the reporter of the United States newspaper had decided to write that the Arrows had been taken to Russian territory "linked."
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it's not a trigger, it's a surprisingly misunderstood word, because I stressed that the Arrows were leaving themselves," remarked the Beard.
"It's slander both against me and against the Arrow," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post there was an article containing the words of Boroday that he had forced Arrowov into Russian territory.
According to the publication, Beard said that he had to bind his companion.
The Polish authorities have begun searching for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish foresters have begun to cut trees over an underground tunnel, where there are some reports of a train with the gold of the Third Reych.
Work began on Tuesday, 15 September, reports the Reuters.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to test the validity of rumours about railways with treasures.
There may be weapons and precious minerals inside the train.
On August 31, the Polish voivodeship governor Tomás Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz) suggested that the new evidence of a gold train was no greater than the previous one.
However, the authorities decided to block the search area.
Three days earlier, the Polish Undersecretary of Culture, Peter Zhukhovski, said that local treasure-searchers had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reign, which was mentioned in the legends.
Zhukhovski said that if the assumptions were confirmed and the jewels were discovered, they would become the property of the State treasury, and the treasure would not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a law firm contacted the Polish city of Walbžich with a report that they had found a train in a blocked tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The Russian main drugologist suggested that tobacco should not be sold to persons under 21 years of age.
Russia's main drugologist has offered to ban the sale of tobacco until 21 years of age.
Yevgeny Brüne pointed out that up to that age, "any substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly dangerous."
So he said live on Radio Voice of Moscow, commenting on the fact that the Speaker of Valentine Matvieenko had supported the idea of preventing the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
People grow up to be unequal.
You can serve in the military from the age of 18, and you're physically ready for it.
He's mentally ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
"We know from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is only mature by 21 years old," observed Breen.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the “Treasure Russia” project, Sultan Hamzaev, reported to the Newsletters that Matvieenko had supported the initiative to raise the age of alcohol sales and had “agreed with the Public Chamber to raise the matter again on the site of the Upper House of Parliament”.
According to the activist, a working group will soon be set up in the Federation Council to draft a draft law under the leadership of Matvieenko.
The Bible was asked to test the compatibility of the Child Information Protection Act
A resident of Novosibirsk requested the Regional Public Prosecutor's Office to check the Bible on the compatibility of the Federal Act on the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to their Health and Development, which was submitted on 16 September by the correspondent Sib.fm.
The author stated that on August 26, 2015, he bought a Bible at the Chitay City store in Red Avenue, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
He found in the text of the book fragments which he considered to violate the FZ “On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development”.
On 16 September the application was accepted by the prosecutor ' s office in Novosibirsk.
Novosibirsk will respond within 30 days.
The point is not to ban a book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, commenting the applicant to CORRESPONDENT Sib.fm.
Besides, it's a very fundamental problem that will engulf society.
It will start reading the Bible, which it had not done before.
The Brazilian Union of Pediatricians, Rio Grande, promotes healthy breast-feeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method by which it is intended to convince women of the need for proper feeding during breast-feeding: the method involves showing images of babies sucking their breasts written by images of malignant food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
In view of the high energy needs of pregnant and pregnant women, it is recommended that the daily calorie rate be increased by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one increase in calorie is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical School in Texas, found that healthy eating of pregnant women actually affects the expression of children's genes and prevents them from developing tumours.
Unfortunately, the negative effects of unhealthy diet on the child's immune system have been detected.
A school bus was hit by a train under Hamburg.
A train crashed into a school bus near Hamburg, which was stuck on the railroad.
A 23-year-old woman driver, aware that she could not move off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a collision in front of them.
He was videotaped by one of the students.
The emergency caused a panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the road.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was injured by a miracle except one train passenger who was slightly injured.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) leadership called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local sportsman David Brown, Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a battle with the Philippine Carlo Magali.
The International Boxing Federation (IBF)'s game for one of the Regional Titles in the weight category of up to 57.15 kg, which lasted on Friday, ended with Magali's victory in the 12th round.
Brown got into the hospital with a skull-brain injury.
His condition was considered critical and he was connected to a life support device.
Brown won 22 victories in the professional ring, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended in vain.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second death rate among Australian boxers in the past six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student named Bradon Smith died of injuries in the ring.
The AMA now recommends not to engage in this sport, but rather to ban it at all from its point of view.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally,' said the vice president of the organization, Stephen Pairnis.
But in the form that boxing now exists, there will always be situations where an athletic gets either a haemorrhage or a brain injury, resulting in either death or serious damage.
For that reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to lift the sanctions against Russian Parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Sergei Narishkin, said that sanctions against Parliamentarians should not be allowed.
He said so when he addressed the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as an intolerable act, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomatic.
"And this should not happen again, because it is a manifestation of political shame and a disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the members of the OSCE PA to re-establish a Russian-European partnership.
Let's get morals back into politics.
Let us restore dialogue and the right to international communication.
Let us restore humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
"The twins never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the margins of the Parliament, the Speaker of the Russian State Government called upon Parliamentarians to call an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I encourage the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiation and to immediately call our inter-parliamentary group,” said Narishkin.
He also said that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) should be commended.
"It's almost the only common ground where they still discuss how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," underlined the politician.
We recall that the fall session of the Parliament opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until 18 September.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple or three days.
Sergei Schubenkov's world champion in light athletics.
This season is a triumphant one for a 24-year-old light-liter from Barnaul Sergei SHUBENKOV.
He managed to win 110 meters at the European team, to set several records, and, above all, to become the world champion, with the first ever domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the sportsman recently won the final stage of the Brilliant League, taking third place.
"New News" asked Schubenkov to share the impressions of the coming season.
Sergei, is the season not over for you yet?
Yeah, I'm going to go to the World Wars, which will take place in October in Korea, and then I'm going to think about resting.
True, I'm going to be at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a different condition.
It's easier than every week going around the world.
You once said autumn was your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a wonderful time.
The passions after the main start of the season are overwhelmed, and the burden of responsibility is no longer strained.
You can have fun at relaxation.
Plus, you know, vacation's very soon...
Are you tired?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
At the end of the season, fatigue always accumulates.
And it doesn't matter what I did more, winning or losing.
Every competition is stress.
Flying around, moving around -- it doesn't all go away for the body.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But right now, I've got emotions, of course.
What's the matter? I'm just happy!
By the time you finish the Beijing World Cup, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you journalists keep me from forgetting it.
But in general, I think it's bad for a sportsman who lives old victories to run his successful race over and over again.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple or three days and we have to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season quite different from the usual?
I can't say there was something special.
We started in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
Trained first at home in Barnaul, then at meetings, then at home again.
It's the usual.
But the job with the coach was to try to get to a new level I haven't been to.
Almost all winter time was spent laying down a base.
We ran through a bunch of sneakers, and we made physical exercises that included both a pull and a seat, and we rolled our backs.
And then they went on a barrier training, and they were doing a lot of technology.
Have you been watching your opponents?
I'm always trying to do that, and there's no problem with the Internet age.
I watched Europe's winter championship, and there, in a frightful sprint, the French took over the pedestal!
I thought I should do something, dilute this company.
At every start of this season, you added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've had all these recent seasons coming up about the same pattern.
There's nothing I run before 13.20 and then there's 13.50.
I always twist my shape gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused on this result.
But the paradox is, it feels like it's ready to do a great job, and it's not always a good idea to be ready at competitions.
How was it, for example, at the London Games?
I, honestly, tried to forget right away.
It was really good, really could run out of 13 seconds.
Even if you repeated your best score at the moment, you'd be a bronze winner of the game.
But bad luck.
Remember your first world championship?
What about it?
It was in Tegu.
I really wanted to get into the finals at the time, and it was such a program-maximum.
And fell right off in the morning, in the pre-race race.
That's when I realized that tearing and breaking my head means never running away.
Two years later, at the Moscow World Cup, he went to the finals with the best time.
I remember very well how I felt before the decisive race: I really wanted to win gold at the time!
How does it work to keep your head down and keep your head down?
And that's the hardest part.
You have to be very careful, you have to focus on technology, so you don't have to break the barriers.
I noticed that it's much easier when you focus on the process rather than the result.
And when you get the feeling that you're running, it's like you're doing it!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our sportsmen from the interior, after their first major successes, are trying to move closer to the capital.
Have you never thought that way?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I am without my coach, who needs me?
It might be nice to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be satisfied with what I have.
How long have you two been together?
Since I was 12 years old, since I went to athletic.
Actually, I first trained with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, tripled.
The children's multi-fight was when the ball gets thrown, jumps in length from the place...
At 14 he tried running with the barriers, and I liked it.
Since the first race, it has been possible to meet the second-generation norm.
It's just like that.
There was never a fear of barriers?
One day, I got a deal with them.
But technology has always had to work very hard.
There's one race that I've been tormenting!
But this routine doesn't get anywhere.
The tech needs to be sharpened all the time -- to wake me up at night, I got up right now and I would run through the barriers.
All those who saw your race in Beijing say it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually renegotiate my races, and I can't help it here.
But you have to work on efficiency -- there's no limit to perfection.
Aren't you afraid that winning a year before the Games will weigh heavily on your shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
If you choose this path, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you shouldn't feel any extra load.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Othar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive that I'm amazed at the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, with their bread don't feed-- give, give the enemy a lift.
And even though I didn't fly a flag, and the same thing, exactly the same thing, I've talked a million times here, and I didn't directly call anybody a bastard, another thing struck me.
All my pseudo friends were in a moment, and they disappeared in a second.
The pressing I'm experiencing is so strong that even I, when I've seen a species of boys, think people are full of whites.
It was like walking, walking, and you were attacked by a crowd, and you had to put your hands on it.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, old man, I'm scared.
The other thing is, there's no support.
I haven't had any illusions, and now...
The best thing about me was self-sufficiency, so bite it.
And giving passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson can only be idiots.
I wish I, the best journalist, had a shameful job.
A week ago in Kiev, Othar Kushanashvili described criminal events in a sharp fashion:
What they did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call an angation.
I believe that the reference to how the drunken Chrushchev was trying to sign something doesn't fit into the general picture of human living.
It's like coming to the neighbour and taking his apartment...
The war from the Kremlin has gone on, and it will only end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like the summer of 2008, it started with the call of some bastard from the Kremlin's lockup.
I'm guessing who it might be...
Cobzone doesn't have much to live on.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Poetin's hands.
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, they destroyed his monument.
Of course, people remembered it as insulting to their small country.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovitch.
Sunrise The seventh leads the rating despite the 9th attempt to highlight the failure of leaders at Today Show
Carl Stephanowicz and Lisa Wilkinson's retreat to Canberra to highlight the implications of the Liberian Party's announcement to vacate the leader's seat failed to significantly raise the ratings of today.
The 9th morning show was broadcast from the state capital after Malcolm Turnbull destroyed Tony Abbott.
The competition, Sunrise, with leading David Koch and Samanta Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
The length of the torture seemed to be of little importance to Australian television viewers, with a Sunrise audience of 397,000 viewers in five of the largest cities, compared to a Today audience of 339,000.
Today scored slightly more than its ratings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers in September, compared to 314,000 in Today.
It's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the update!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015.
The big news for Seven was the amazing 800 Words debut with former star of Packed to the Rafters by Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the recently widowed father of a family who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with their two children gathered an exciting audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics reasoned whether Thompson could handle the popular show alone, without Rebecca Gibney's Rafters star.
The result of last night is the loud answer "yes."
The X Factor seventh remained strong with a audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily passing The Block (838000) and TBL Familes (726 000).
Success and failure on the second evening of the Chase Australia blended for the seventh.
The first half an hour (from 17:00 to 17:30 a.m.) of the new television show, led by Andrew O'Keefi, gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half an hour (from 5:30 to 6 p.m.), the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers, enough for a small victory over the Hot Seat by Eddy McGuire (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of the Chase Australia gathered 520,000 audiences, and the second half an overwhelming 720,000 audiences.
Hot Seat collected 620 000.
The fall in the Chase Australia ratings for the second night will make the 9th quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for the Million Dollar Minute, which failed to replay the McGuire show.

The three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Secret solved?...
Lena Djevon-Fellows, Sarah MacKay and Snow Marcoski may have accidentally indicated which of them will win at the "Blood."
The woman with whom Sam Wood will end up in The Bachelor is surrounded by a shadow of mystery.
And the three girls who got to the finals, of course, remain silent about which one of them got his last rose.
But when we met Sarah MacKay, Snow Marcos and Lena Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls would have to stay, they might have accidentally given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood remains silent until the end of Thursday.
All three women come in a liric spirit, explaining why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purpose, family values, vitality as a reason why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, by answering the question, "If not you, who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could unwittingly tell which one of them had actually conquered the heart of the "People."
Jevons-Fellows and Marcos have no doubt called Mackey the perfect match for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship since day one.
"From the moment I joined the party, I felt the energy (Sara) and the energy of Sam and realized that they were very suited to each other, and I didn't doubt it all along," said Jevons-Fellows.
"Sara is a very open man, with her easy and fun," added Marcoski.
I saw them together, and there's really an attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks that she and Sam Wood are going to make a great match.
MacKay herself said that, thanks to her home dates last week, she realized that Wood might be "the very person."
"The moment I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it wasn't exactly just a game -- I really believed him," she said.
The question of whom to choose voodoo, if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same, and snowflake and lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor shows on Wednesday at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarrid Hein had several options to start his career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the United States, as were a lot of other clubs that sent requests after an exciting public training day at the end of last year.
But Hain chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seemed like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hain on the bench for the rest of the game for losing the ball, which former Australian rugby League player allowed on the first return of the pont in a win-win game with Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hein another opportunity to get back the pont, and he also played it after Reggie Bush's injuries.
Tomsula showed herself on the right side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of having the newcomers thrown away in front of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hain at a press conference after the match.
Special reporter for the 49ers Club, Cam Inman, reported that Hein had also received support from Thomas McGoy's Special Team Coordinater, who had advised him to forget about the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jarrid Hain lost the ball on the return of the pont by the Minnesota Waikings team during the first quarter.
This is the beginning of Hain's NHL debut and his numerous Australian fans were clearly not expected.
It was apparent that Hain was fighting when he left the field after losing the ball, and he later told the host of the show "Hames and Andy" at Radio 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a more unsuccessful start for a career in the NFL.
"It happens, you just think about the next game and that's all," said Hain.
Hein compared his debut with the 2007 Origin game series, when the ball shot in his credit zone tried Queensland.
After all, this experience proved to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hein took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture to Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Poetin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkowski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of use of weapons at the airport in Siberia.
President Vladimir Poetin was openly challenged, Khodorkowski was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were interrupted.
There were clashes between the police and the immigrants at the Hungarian border.
The refugees had protested at the Serbian border near the Hungarian settlement of Resque, which had grown into clashes with the security guards.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water wells and tear gas, handing out the Reuters.
The immigrants were throwing stones at the police and trying to tear down the fence on the border.
Support has been sent to the scene of the fighting, and police officers have responded to the harassment and attempts by the migrants to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of immigrants ran into Hungarian territory.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus towards Belgrade and the Croatian border, reports BBC.
The authorities had allowed immigrants to arrive in Croatian territory and to transport them from there to the appropriate country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament tightened its migration and border protection legislation.
The amendments provide for the military to take part in the protection of State borders, for the prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and for an accelerated procedure for processing asylum requests.
The Hungarian court had already found one of the immigrants guilty of illegal crossing the Hungarian-Serb border and would therefore be deported and would not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament is also about to consider transferring responsibility for border protection to the Hungarian armed forces.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began building a barbed wire fence with a length of 175 km on the border with Serbia to prevent the flow of immigrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian has confessed to having committed the largest cyberattack in United States history.
A Russian accused of the largest cyberattack in United States history, Vladimir Drinkman, confessed to stealing over 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial before the New Jersey State Court, Drinkman confessed to colluding to gain access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, a Russian spoke of a collusion with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The cumulative damage from the accused's actions was estimated at $300 million.
"Such defendants as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," states U.S. prosecutor Paul Fishman.
Drinkman faces 30 years' imprisonment, and a fine of a million dollars.
When a sentence is handed down, the court will take account of the Russian confession and may reduce the sentence.
The verdict to Drinkman will be pronounced on January 15th.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitri Smilnet, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt for the crimes he is accused of.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the Russian-supported risk of Bashar Assad's regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian MID, Sergei Lavrov, US secretary John Kerry, warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“The secretary of Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and exacerbating the conflict as well as our common goal of fighting extremistism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” says a report published on the U.S. State Department's website.
Kerry confirmed the US's commitment to fighting the Islamic State (which is prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) group of more than 60 States.
According to the secretary of State, Assad "can never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of support for the Assad regime.
Earlier, the White House spokesperson, Joshua Ernest, threatened Russia with isolation unless it stopped supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest had offered to join an international coalition that was conducting an anti-terror operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media have frequently reported the presence of Russian soldiers in Syria.
To which Russian MID leader Sergey Lavrov stated that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and were helping Syrians to master technology in order to apply it against Islamists.
Four people died when police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, as the official announced on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Bishnu Prasad Dacal, head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at one of the police stations, some throwing stones and arson bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that police used tear gas and then shot in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to be capable of being killed, but are commonly used as a less deadly alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This was the last violent protest in a few weeks in southern, lowland Nepal, where the Madesi people claim that the new provinces created by the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
The protests also took place in western Nepal, among the citizens of the Tarau people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a highly disputed issue in Nepal, which had been centralized for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been under way since 2008, but the lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that took thousands of lives in April.
The lawmakers voted for articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials announced that a new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest town in Irkutsk.
It was built in the 1970s as a centre of the chemical industry, and it has a developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk headed the new mayor, Oleg Borowski.
He reported on the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects to the Regional correspondent.
Oleg Valeryvich, where did you start your job as the mayor?
I first examined the results of the financial and economic performance tests and initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditure.
Subsequently, an audit of the municipal property was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the volume of documents to five days.
Previously, the papers could go through the courts for months.
Measures have been developed to improve the income base and to optimise costs.
Last November, a government retreat was held in Sayansk to address the economic and social development of the Territory.
The city did not have any design and design documentation (PPA) for any site.
Without that, Sayansk could not take part in the federal programs.
We started with the preparation of POJA on the roads, the nursery, the northern sewer, and the water pipe.
Roadworks are already under way on two sites.
How is the Russian President's decree on the construction of nursery schools being implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
This positive demography has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in day care today is one of the most pressing.
Since 1 September, it has closed for the major maintenance of day-care centre No. 10, which is designed for 320 places.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million roubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, day-care centre No. 23 was opened and 200 children are now attending.
The repairs were co-funded from the district and local budget, costing more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the Administration and the assistance of the Regional Government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment have been secured, and the People's Initiatives programme has also helped.
There are plans to start building a new nursery in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the priority of children between the ages of one and a half and three.
We don't have three to seven years of children's waiting lists.
Are the investors interested in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be carried out, above all by the Kenyan companies, and that it is they that should be employed.
Already in October, a 60th apartment house for orphaned children in the Leningrad district is now in operation.
As far as construction is concerned, Sayansk is one of the four cities of Piangarya, which is part of an economic-class shelter program.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 blocks will begin shortly.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of shelter for those who wish to participate in the programme.
One of the conditions is that the dwelling must not exceed 30,000 roubles per square metre; this cost includes a turnkey cut.
If we get through this, we'll continue to be part of the program.
As for the investor, we have other interesting projects.
The site was built by the Sayan Porcine Complex, which was sold for nothing in 2004.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to challenge this deal.
All the more so because the land under the object is in federal ownership.
Work is under way with Moscow, and the transfer of 88 ha to the district property is being resolved, and the transfer of land to the city is being carried out.
There is a potential investor willing to invest 1.5 billion roubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of a pig-to-peak, we'll have 900 jobs that will be of great help to the city.
Is there an institute of social partnership in Sayansk?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership instruments.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Enterprises such as the East Centre, the Novo-Zimian TEC, the Sayan Broyler OLK, the PC of the IDF have been strongly supported, and the management of these companies responds to all requests.
Directly on D-Day, the Sayan Broyler gave the town a town of children, and East Central renovated a horseyard where professionals were treating children with hypothesis, costing over 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsoring funds, the city's register has been secured.
Sponsors have helped celebrate City Day in a colorful way.
As in the old days, a parade took place with the participation of city communities and organizations.
A history of the city, a book of Saiyan poets, was published.
The first builders and people who have contributed seriously to the development of Sayansk have been given a commemorative coin.
The Mecents also participate in the City Charitable Foundation.
The first step was to buy tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, over 800,000 roubles have been designed to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive care and to support children from low-income families.
How are human resources problems in the social sphere being addressed in Sayansk?
There are not enough doctors and teachers in the city.
The provision of shelter for professionals is of great importance in addressing the human resources issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have been assigned to the office.
We have a shelter allocation program that can be privatized in five years.
Plans are to reconfigure a building where eight more teachers' apartments will be built.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the "Life for the Russian Family" program.
In the long run, building a house for budget workers.
Most importantly, there's a working team in town with which I can handle the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
A bill has been submitted to the Duma on the indexation of social benefits based on price increases.
A bill has been submitted to the State Duma which provides for the indexation of social pensions every year since 1 February, taking into account rising prices.
The author, Alexander Lomakin-Romanski, a member of the Fair Russian Federation, also suggests that an additional index be made on 1 April, if the rate of growth of the minimum living rate exceeds the rate at which the prices of goods and services are rising.
The indexation of social benefits under the current legislation has been carried out annually since 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth of the minimum living rate in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law submitted to the lower chamber provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions based on the rate of growth of consumer prices.
The first indexation is carried out on 1 February and the second is held on 1 April.
The Head of the OSCE PA has told Mogerini that it is not possible to impose sanctions on Parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federico Mogerini, the Speaker of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Ilka Kanerva, the PA, declared that no sanctions should be applied against the lawmakers participating in the assembly.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbator by Nikolay Kovalev.
The TASS reports that European Parliamentarians, including the representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, have signed in support of the Canerva position.
"There's already strong enough support," said Kovalev.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had intended to collect signatures from members who had indicated that there should be no sanctions against Parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev stated that Kanerva had promised to raise the issue to the level of EU leadership and to “send the appropriate petition”.
NHS reports that the probability of a Cyclone south of the Green Cape Islands is 60%.
The wide front of the low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape Islands is likely to become a tropical Cyclone within the next 48 hours, reported by the United States National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
Another clearly defined low-pressure area about the middle of the Green Cape Islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60 percent probability of a tropical Cyclone in the next two days, reported by synoptics from Miami.
Google launches a doubling campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling campaign designed to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help flooding European refugees fleeing war-torn and poor countries.
Google used an uncharacterized personal approach to announce a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google employee Rita Masud, who was running away with a family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We've been on dubious trains and buses, suffering hunger, thirst, cold, and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and immigrants in Europe has increased, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
Contributions will be donated to four non-profit organizations working for refugees and immigrants: Médecins sans frontières, the International Salvation Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google announced that it would double the first $5.5 million in donations until it reached $11 million on google.com/refugeerelief.
Europe has stood up to the worst crisis with refugees since the Second World War, caused for the most part by a four-year civil war in Syria, which has caused the displacement of more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.

Diabetes with slight obesity can be helped by obesity surgery
The positive effects of obesity surgery in people with small obesity, type 2 diabetic, can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with slight obesity live longer after obesity surgery than non-surgeons.
"Death statistics don't appear immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgeon who wrote about a new study in the column of the JAMA Surgery editor.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organizations to absorb food.
In a few years, bariatric surgery has proved to be effective in treating type 2 diabetic, but the main studies have been carried out among people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (MTI) 35 or more.
IMT, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or more suggests that humans are overweight and people with IMTs above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwan Min-Sheng General hospital have used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, bypassing the stomach and sleeve ghettomy, with type 2 diabetic treatment for people with slight obesity.
The average value of MTFs for those who have experienced surgery has fallen from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, those who received non-chirurgical treatment for diabetic remain at about 29 years old.
Among those who suffered the surgery, 36 percent were completely cured of diabetic and 28 percent partially.
In the group that received medication, for comparison, only 1% of the total cures were recorded, and only about 2% of the total cures were found.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" LPNP cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors claim.
Researchers also controlled blood hemoglobin levels of A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels in a dynamic way.
Hemoglobin A1c is best held below 7%, by researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But the best Glycemic controls, reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c, have not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Cheng Soo, research director, and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gistrectomy group, the bypass team lost more weight (18.7 kg as opposed to 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in MMT (7.4 as against 5.1.1) and A1c (3.1 per cent as against 2.1 per cent) and was close to the full remission of diabetic (46.9 per cent as against 16.7 per cent).
While the new study does not show the advantages of a surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does result in longer life expectancy, as reported by Blackstone of the University of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who had chosen bariatric interference, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29% lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone observed that it was encouraging for people with IMTs below 35 interested in such a procedure.
"The report here is very important, as it states that such surgery is safe in a low-ITI group where there is no increased risk of death or renal disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's IMT is between 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long to make people take it seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they've accumulated genetic changes that trigger obesity and Diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to reverse it.
In the Washhouses, the robbers removed their coats and 9 million rubles from the house.
In the Washhouses, robbers attacked the inhabitants of the Moscow house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's coats from them.
Interfax reports this with a reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two persons unknown through the open front door entered a house located on Gorski Street, tied up the 20-year-old son of the housewife and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three coats.
Preliminary evidence suggests that the damages amounted to 9,265,000 roubles, and criminal proceedings have been initiated under the heading “Cruciality”.
European fans risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 hotels in Petersburg have the right to host tourists who will come to the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are still in a hurry to obtain permission.
According to experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to world supremacy, the authorities will soon have to come up with a way to displace all the guests of the city.
The Rosbalt interviewers believe that because of the tournament, the rent of rented apartments will increase by 10 to 30 percent, and after the championship for rented apartments will have to be overpaid.
The world soccer championship made the authorities pay attention to the condition of Russian hotels.
By law written specifically for the first place, every hotel in Petersburg must be classified and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is clear that not all will be able to do so: hotels are so afraid of testing that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Petersburg.
As Vadim Vladimirov, head of UFAS, said, the agency has examined the 138 hotels and is now planning to run 34 hotel cases, many of which have simply not responded to the anti-monoperators.
There are signs that the leaders of three dozen companies have deceived citizens by placing a certain number of stars in advertising, noting Vladimirov.
The problem is, right now literally every number, no one gets lost before 2018.
The officials suspect that during the soccer championship the fans will occupy all the hotels in Petersburg.
Tourists can now rely on 30,000 rooms in the city.
In St. Petersburg there are 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, and 550 single-star hotels.
According to Nana Gwitz's First Alternate Tourist Development Committee, only 23 hotels have been classified so far, so many checks have been made by companies that have been approved in Petersburg.
And whether a hotel ordered a similar procedure from a regional company, it's surprisingly unknown.
I mean, there may be more classified, but nobody knows about it.
"The last six months of hotels did not really want to be classified," acknowledged the director of the Northwest branch of the Russian Touring Union, Yekaterin Shadski.
This is due to the high season, during which hotels earn the most money and are unwilling to do other things.
Another reason is the budget for which the costs of testing have not been charged, and the procedure may be used by the hotel, depending on the status of 30 to 100,000 roubles or more.
However, the hotel managers had recently stepped up and started applying for classification, and had assured Shadski.
The hotels have to make it by July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine, but will not be allowed to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that depending on starry, a fixed hotel price will be set for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas on which the value will be calculated will be published next year.
This is done to prevent prices from rising by 200-300 percent, as is the case, for example, during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience and you don't want a promotion two or three times, but hotels have to earn a living.
"I think it'll be up to 50%," explained the president of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure that price fixing is compatible with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much it fits into economic theory, but I hope it's justifiable.
"It's better than an unbridled journey," he remarked.
It's not clear what happens to popular cheap hostels.
Members of the State had submitted a bill under which hostels should be prohibited in apartments.
It is highly hoped that this law will not be passed or will not affect Petersburg.
"We'll defend the view that hostels must be preserved," Nana Gavácius thinks.
However, she said that the owners of the mini-hotels should in any case be prepared to tighten the living code.
If the State Duma finally approves the bill, there will be about 80 percent of the hotels in Petersburg, and at present there are 1,500 rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Rectors and Hotels of the Northwest, Leonid Garbara, there are not enough two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are demanded by football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.
This is the same as when "the 80 thousandth Stadium has 75,000 spikes."
This can be corrected at the expense of mini-hotels.
The expert thinks it's an idiotic thing to say, "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, but some people don't."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, I agree it's wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where guests come for a short time, why not?
Mini hotels risk skipping the World Cup because of their slowness.
Hundreds of little hotels will not be able to get classed, and they dig the hole themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all the city's hotels will be booked.
"Companies that can perform this procedure are not many, so they'll give up less paid orders from the mini-hotel, but will choose the ones that are travelling," remarked Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the rate of the checks performed is now much higher than the ones in Petersburg.
The reason for the Paterburg delay was due, among other things, to the continuous transition in the Government's tourist industry, which did not contribute to the smooth operation.
According to experts, if the hotels in Petersburg are not enough, it is likely that attention will have to be paid to the district hotels and rest houses.
Like the 300th anniversary celebration of Petersburg, the river fleet can be mobilised into the city, so the guests of the tournament will be able to live in their quarters.
In addition, many fans will have prepared to come to the vans where they can spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels to be empty," I'm sure Genady Lamshin.
It will also be very popular during the football premiere.
It's likely that a reserve of rented apartments will be created in the city.
The rent will increase by 10 to 30 percent.
"Of the obvious, the first to go home near the stadium," remarked a specialist in the Development and Real Estate Research Agency, Larissa Bragin.
However, the price of the lease may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
The construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city would also contribute to this, she stressed.
Let us not forget the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city where people not only guide the way but can also conduct a mini-excursion.
There are also complications.
My dad met a family in the yard in 1970 from Murmansk -- father, mother and two children.
They had no place to sleep; the hotels were difficult at the time, and it was hard to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," remembered the interviewer.
True, he added that there was no such thing left in the city -- calling to his home would have consequences and terrible consequences.
But in 2018, after the State's failures, the hotels' mistakes, and the government's mistakes, maybe we'll have to remember the past.
Zhirinovski's silencing in the Amur region.
I was fascinated to watch Girinowski's clown in the State Duma today.
He did these things when our generation was just learning how to sell newspapers, and it's still in beautiful shape.
The theme of the speech is, like, "A protest by the LDPR against the results of the elections in the Amur region."
The protocols do not shake -- for nothing; there are no protocols except those signed by the berms, apparently.
He picks up Ivan Abramov's second position and shouts something like, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And then she jumps at Rodnine, and then, after a fight with the president, she pulls the faction out of the conference room, shouting literally "You're all with the fronts of your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abramov, but rather on the scandal and demarcation of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
Indeed, Wolfowitz had beautifully and elegantly drained the Amur region along with Abramov.
For the whole country, it's another "Points" Girinoski thing, not a protest by a political party against the results of a particular election.
Both the faction have officially scanned and the elections, according to the party's site and Facebook of Ivan Abramov, have not been recognized, but the leader of the subject is evidently falling.
Makes it possible for the dead in Amura to bury their dead themselves, while he himself speaks the good news against the One Russia in general and an innocent native.
It's a fine decision not to lose a face, not to go to a real scandal.
The other thing is, now it turns out that Abram himself is in a strange situation.
Except for his boss's screams, he waited for nothing, and there are no alternative protocols in his hands.
He -- not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other -- for a narrow circle, he became the formal reason and to insult a respected champion, and, even more, the cham hits on EP and ONF.
And then, of course, he has to think really hard about what to do.
Because from the main winner of the elections, region number two policy and candidate number one for the only single district, it can turn into a couple that successfully enjoyed their own party leadership and super-attractor for the same FNL and the party leadership of another.
I'm sure it wouldn't have been Girinovsky, but it should have been invented and observed respectfully.
The trumpet is still growing and growing.
The news is that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next prisoner.
So the bath fell from nothing at all.
The subject of Abram was buried under him.
It's beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe." -Dalay Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhism called for an end to violence in the countries of origin of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing crisis of refugees in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre of Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be greater than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while it was admirable, the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The care of thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you must think about lasting solutions, how to bring true peace and true development, mainly through education, to these Islamic countries," he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the 9/11 attacks, saying that the US's strong reaction had triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to the problem was possible through non-Violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed hands disinfectant over the past 4 years
Toxicological Centers in the United States have reported an almost 400 per cent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who have swallowed high-alcohol disinfectant hands, according to the Georgia State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gailord López, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Center, cases of children under 12 years of age swallowing of hand-disinfected fluids reported to the Toxicology Centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children contact these substances more frequently, and unfortunately some percent of them go to the E.R.," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some kids drink disinfectant fluid on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking disinfectant fluids as cheap drinks.
Youngsters were reported to have mixed disinfectant fluid with alcohol-containing lip stripping fluid in order to obtain a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the pleasant smells of disinfectant fluid.
"The child doesn't think it can hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand-disinfectant) are those that are scented.
There are disinfectant hands that smell strawberries, grapes, oranges that are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant hand fluid contains about 45 to 95 percent of the alcohol.
In young children, especially, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is a high-concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, Chief Doctor of the Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't just leave a glass of whisky, but people are keeping these disinfectant tools in sight for their hands, and if kids get to them, it's a fast way to use a lot of alcohol.
Najja Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a strawberry-scented disinfectant for her hands at school, was sent to the E.R. for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nayja confused her words and could not walk when she was taken to the E.R.
The doctors observed her all night at a separate children's hospital to avoid missing any signs of brain damage, as the girl fell and hit her head, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," said the CNN Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-piral or disinfectant napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant hand fluids from the children ' s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxical undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three four-year-old students in North New York conspired to poison their "abhorrent" teacher by "distributing anti-bacterial substances in the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to arm disinfectors, and she's not allowed to keep them in her classroom.
The police consider the failed plan to be "empty conversations" and address disciplinary matters to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the N.C. Corpusian Corky Children's Library, the iron owl is saddened.
The kids who come for books are trying to feed her candy.
He's been in this library for 95 years for generations.
The first readers in the 20th century used to make a lot of reading here, perform on the verses of Mayakovsky, perform literature quiz and write to Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted for four years, and as The Young Stalin newspaper wrote in 1939, every day "the friendship between hope and the friends of the Barnaul Children's Library" became stronger.
Constantine's hope even sent a distant Barnaul friend a picture of her child.
And when the Barnauls asked if hope of Constantine had any objection to the library's naming, they said no, they didn't.
The letters have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren of the first readers have to explain to them whose hard profile decorates the library.
During the years of reconstruction, people often called, and they resented: Why is the children's library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of some good child writer, no political colour!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave it as it was.
"Crop" is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, like a "Leninca" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library hall is a track of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is Oli Moscow's favorite theme.
Olya used to be a law firm manager, came to work at eight, left at five, and all the other managers were marked by love for drawing.
And then I found an ad online saying, "I need an imager for a book."
A little American girl wrote a book called My Cancer Mommy -- "My mom has cancer."
Olya made pictures, and thought, life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it if you don't create them yourself.
Now she works in a library, she illustrates children's books by writers all over the world, and she writes stories herself.
Traditionally, it is believed that children lose interest in the book, that they live more and more in some virtual space...
But we have kids who are reading, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, says "The Russian Planet," the director of the Tatiana Kushvid library.
In recent years, we've even had such a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and it's going to live -- kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
There's a large exhibition wall in the library hall with an up-to-date photography.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library as a family are displayed: mom, dad, and kids.
The library is pleased to see more and more popes coming with their children.
If the child was read all over Chukowski at two years of age, he needs more books at older ages.
But there's a law in place that prevents an eight-year-old from issuing books from category 12+.
To get a book like this, a child has to bring his parents along -- they come in, they come back again, and gradually "Crop" becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library -- the pre-revolution collection was made with eggs and eras, and the Coronenko's app to the Niwa magazine, a 1936 Murzilki separator.
Because we're not just the conceptual space of the book's Temple, we're open to movement, we're trying to become a special place -- not home, not work, not school -- Tatiana Kuszvid explains.
You can come to us to read, play, paint.
We've made a playground for the kids -- the baby comes just to play, and the hand is still reaching out to the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they are stuck with their feet, and they don't want to leave.
Moms often come in with wheels -- and we're pleased that they put the library at the top of all the other places they have to go with the kids.
Tatiana Kuszvid says that modern children, like us, love classic children's literature:
"The publishing business is now evolving, and much attention is being paid to authors, who are the link between generations."
And when it comes to little kids, they need to have some kind of hero who travels from one book to the next.
Children don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes leaflets for parents, describing what is happening in modern children's literature, what books should be looked at, and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library isn't for them.
It is forbidden for adults to carry books outside the reading hall.
Only children have this magic privilege.
...in the nearest library room there's a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase in the cellar, in the bookshop.
Steps will squeak under your feet -- it's a very old time machine.
You meet your childhood book like an old friend: hi, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ally still walks along the road with a yellow brick, the lazy Tol Reddies steals magic matches, and the Malchis-Kibalchish never told the damned Bourgeois of the War Secret--that's the hard word he's got.
Books like passwords can be found anywhere.
There's real book rares in the vault -- for example, the pre-revolution collection was with eggs and eras.
Or lead Coronenko in a famous app to the Niwa magazine.
Or a 1936 Murzzle embroidery.
Time has aged the pages, colored them into tea.
These publications are no longer published to readers.
These are the pieces of our future collection, I dream of getting retired and doing rare children's books.
But the kids won't take it, so to speak, and the paints in the old books aren't very bright, and the themes are... you open the front page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it's like, why did we all write "Pioneer Truth?"
But it was still interesting, says "The Russian Planet" by Galina Ilyasov, who runs the bookshop.
The pages of the Murzzle have become dark from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna runs the bookshop her entire life.
She knows the color of Buratino's hat, in which school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Gryffindor team at the Quidditch championship, in which Carlson uses a silencer for the engine, and what Alice Selezny's father works.
A librarian pays little for his work, and everyone who can live without these book rows finds a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, chaplains of the book.
You can also recognize them by smiling -- it's believed to be a professional feature of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you at the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I like children's books at all: as a librarian I like to have them, to stand upright and beautifully on the shelves, and I love to read them,' said Galina Basiljevna.
I read everything: military, historical, fairy tales, fantastic.
Reading modern Russian writers, fresh translations...
Of course, I think it was different when I was a kid.
The books were the most exciting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And since I loved them crazyly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everybody was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be despite the Riders.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring children or grandchildren...
Rumor mill: There's no dispute in the Celtics.
Gryffiths denied the conversations at the Celtic after Dale's admittance that Hups is in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim against Neilson, while Warberton fears signing a contract in January that might disturb the team's unity.
Dons has increased the advantage of Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first-in-a-half penalty gave Aberdin a small advantage over Hamilton in Pitthory, which allowed Dons to get away from Celtic by five points.
Gryffiths denied the conversations about differences
This led to rumours of differences in the Celtics, which were suppressed by Griffiths, who said that he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling strain, I think players are keen on it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots aren't fighting for the title--de Boer
Former quarterback from Rangers and former member of the Netherlands team, Ronald de Boer, said that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtic because he was not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently a representative of Ayaxa, said, "In Holland, the most beautiful moments of the Celtic Games are no longer shown, why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about coming back to Rangers.
They're talking about an old firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of stress in the old firm games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronny Dale admitted that Celtic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
The defeat of Malmö and the resulting exit from the League of Champions was soon followed by the loss of 10 Aberdin football players, who now scored five points off the top of the table.
However, Dale said, "The Celtic had bad periods before, and we'll come out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I realize it's very unfortunate, and a lot of people are really, really angry or upset about what's going on.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic support because that makes players much better.
Staying together is so important now.
Warberton awaits the January transfers with distrust
Despite the opinions that appeared just a couple of weeks ago, suggesting that he had defined some of the goals of the January transfers, the Rangers boss, Mark Warberton, distrusted the January campaign, arguing that he did not want to destroy the team.
The former Brentford attacker said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in summer, you have a period before the beginning of the season to adapt them, which you saw in our own band this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Michu, interested in the Celtic, hinted at the end of his career.
Suonci's attacker Michu, connected to the Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his Swans contract ended.
A 29-year-old player suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to stand up to the SFA about Neilson's statements.
The Harts led with a 2:1 account when Patterson was removed and began to play 3:2 but the red lawyer card was later canceled; this is the third red Colum card, cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not refuse to say, saying, "I did not doubt the ethic, I did not comment on the game."
Gryffiths vowed to avoid Tyncastle.
A stubborn Hibernian player received a reprimand after admitting to singing an insulting song about former Harts player Rudy Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tyncastle in March 2014.
"It was derby, and it was hot," said the attacker, adding, "I can safely say that I wasn't going to go back to Tyncastle unless he was playing for the Celtic."
Donnelly: The Tannadis Board is confident of the management of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United Board of Directors is still confident that the management team will make a difference, but agrees that the situation on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the kids out again," said Donnelly.
MacInnes is glad that "unattractive" won Hamilton.
Derek McInness admitted that his team, "Aberdin," had had to fight desperately against the Hamilton Assis to win the seventh consecutive league victory, which put them five points above the Celtic, top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Rooney's first-time punishment.
McInness said, "There's no team here that wins anything, a cup or a league championship that didn't win meetings like this."
The rate of unemployment among Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing
INTOLERANCE in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The rate of unemployment in Scotland was 5.9 per cent higher than that in the United Kingdom, as shown by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in three months, with 2,612,000 now working.
The employment rate for Scotland has dropped to 74.0 per cent a quarter, which is higher than the average of 73.5 per cent in the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Minister, David Mendell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The Government's long-term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in Scotland's labour market, with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Why I witness execution in Oklahoma
Today, avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will watch a person be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting at the death row gallery in Oklahoma State, when Richard Glossip is executed with a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
This was the first time this request was made in January, through a close friend of his, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As this day drew near, I began to fear.
So why would you do that?
I accepted because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more people than places, the results of the gloomy lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press places was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'll sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and he and I have a personal relationship after a few months of phone calls and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk to him.
The prison says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of tweeting because I had committed myself to being unbiased.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she could've better spelled it myself, but she still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't, even if he was talking.
I told him he could cut me off his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he died, he believed that transparency would help the process of abolishing the death penalty.
Kim Bellever, the Huffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I wrote down.
I'm not going to go into detail here again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossip isn't guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treeze make him guilty of aiding the crime.
But I believe there's a great chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death sentence was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that angle, I'll watch him die.
I can't claim to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted for this.
From me, you'll find out what it's like to watch someone I like die without need.
A policeman was persuaded to get out of the Canning River.
A constable from Canning Vale managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River and stay dry.
Perth was about to leave the police, but he couldn't get stuck in the dirty water in the shallow water a few yards away from the police officer trying to "smartly persuade him to go to shore."
Cunning-Vale police were called on Tuesday for illegal infiltration in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by rushing to Canning.
But it didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I won't go out, come, grab me," said Sgt. Sandell Castledine.
PC Laclan Perhavetsu didn't really want to wet his uniform, so he used a safer reception -- "talking with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," said Sgt. Castledine.
That's exactly what Ben Cazins' champion football player remembered.
In 2006, Cazins moved into a squirrel to avoid meeting a police officer to test for alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts turned out to be in vain, but they encouraged the locals to invent a funny "Ben Cazins' Biatlon."
Peter Moody accused the stewards of attempting to spy and threatened to quit the horse sport.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria of attempting to infiltrate a spy in his stable last year and threatened to abandon the horse sport immediately.
He was targeted by the officers and officers of Racing Victoria's ethics department, whom he accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the start because of the abuse of drugs on the day of launch, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort to take part in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Lydari-to-cobalt test, which he could not explain.
He kept his tongue on suspicion of spying for a year and a half and didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been through it for a long time, but sometimes it makes you so upset that you're not holding back anymore," said Moody.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head up high and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think it's not, then I'll have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody had previously made a sensational announcement during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy in his stable.
"Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room a year ago with a man I'll call if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to convey information about what I'm doing in my stable," said Moody at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all file complaints, as they have failed to catch me.
Robert Rollston, former President of RVL, David Moody, current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, external Executive Director of RVL, were aware of this all the time and now.
Shouldn't that make me think this is getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold people responsible for what's happening in this business other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I that bad for this profession?
Maybe people in there think that's what it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm talking about can make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
It makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and hold them responsible for the decision.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach's trouble was only growing during a long investigation into the case of Kobalt and Lydari, and the last removal of the horse from the start made him say he could "should throw his license on the table."
Moody, most famous for having prepared the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the medical requirements for the day of the competition "smart" after the horse was put on its feet with a compress of clay, which is a breach of the rules.
It's a race break.
"I must bear full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees accidentally put a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have got it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him the day she ran.
Moody may be disqualified for three months under the rules for the use of medication on a compress day, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," said Moody.
Driver who hit and escaped from the Cobram incident was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobra on the weekend and escaped from the scene.
The motorcyclist was transported by helicopter to Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car in Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, failing to provide assistance and breaking other traffic regulations.
A 40-year-old motorcyclist living in Cobra remains in a stable state in the hospital.
"Melbourne Storm" coach Craig Bellamy is arguing against the opponents for violent tactics.
"Melbourne Storm" coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of intercepting the ball by his team as "animating the agenda" by the two winners of the NRL championship.
Trainer Trent Robinson of the Sydney Rusters stated that the judges allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during the sudden victory of the Storm at the final of the Sydney Qualifications game on Friday night.
Brysbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear hint on "The Storm" after his team won the finals of the Northern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for the Rugby League and said that two of Queensland's team were not "too successful" in the handshake.
Bellamy protected his team from intercepting the ball and said they were just focused on contact by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was convinced by the criticism of his team by the two top coaches, because that means they're worried about the possible defeat of the Storm.
"It keeps popping up--I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about tough moves when they beat us with a score of 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our systems or defences for a year, just over the past six weeks, we've paid special attention to contacting the ball, and that was a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years and he's obviously training a great team, so he probably wasn't used to losing, and it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive soccer," reminding his teacher that "St. George-Illavarra Dragons" Bennett won the championship in 2010 by showing "small" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting soccer.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night, and to see how impressed their game was," Bellamy remarked.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care at all.
But now he's got a team that can show what he thinks is an amazing soccer game, especially his young semi-protectors at their speed.
It's a soccer game you'd like to play when you have such players.
He made that comment in 2010 and now he wants everybody to play soccer in his style -- not every team has two semi-protectors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also remarked that the "Storma" and "Rusters" games were a match with more points than the "Broncos" and the "Cowboys".
The "Broncos" game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game it was 8:18, there were two more attempts--and what, that's an amazing soccer game?
Or consider breaks and unsuccessful attempts to be spectacular?
It's routine to me.
If they mention us, that means we can meet them there at some point.
Storm has a weekend off at the end of this week, since they won either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Kronolla Sharks next Saturday night at the pre-finals at the AAMI Park Stadium, the tickets will be marketed next Tuesday morning.
An accused of possessing drugs, a Serbian, was released on bail for 200,000 dollars.
A man who faces life imprisonment for trying to steal 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released on bail at $200,000.
Marco Maximovitch, 29 years old, is one of five people arrested last month after the Federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay boat, sailing from South America through Vanuatu and mooring in Kumera in August.
Throughout the morning, Maximivic and his accomplices were seen at the dock, and later he met them at a Café of Comera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovitch faces a life sentence for attempting to acquire a sufficient quantity of drugs for sale, counsel for Maximivic claims that there is no evidence that the latter was trying to obtain the entire batch and that the man could be in a cafe without any intent.
High Court judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has connections to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings he had lied to the police about his location.
The mother and stepfather of Maximivic were offered a joint bond of $200,000 for his release.
"It turns out from both accounts that the $200,000 bond is too much of a financial burden for them," remarked Judge Flanagan.
But this is not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovitch was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he would surrender both his Australian and Serbian passport, report daily to the police and observe the curfew from 6 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotiz Cacicaris: "I'm angry with the Greek team that fought until the last few seconds."
He paid tribute to his team after the 1/4 Euro-Basquet 2015 match with Spain (71:73).
He said that the fate of the game was determined by some mistakes.
It was a big game, quotes AFP Cacicaris.
We were preparing for a great Spanish performance game.
We've tried to work in the defence, but the defence mistakes have determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought till the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I'll be entrusted with Kauna's functions in CSKA."
CSK's newest member, Joel Freeland, said he didn't believe in the army's curse.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse the negative tendency and finally win the Euroliga next season.
I spoke to coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team -- quotes Freeland's R-Sport -- in fact, I'm going to be entrusted with the functions of Sasa Kaun, who left the team, both in the defence and in the three-second attack, and I think I can handle it.
Yeah, I'm going to need some time to reconfigure to the center position, but I've been playing more forward in the NBA.
Now we're going to have to face up to the big center of the opponent, but I've done this before, so I think I can handle it now.
The army won the European League for the last time in 2008.
Since then, they've made six trips to Final Four, but they haven't been able to show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling that somebody jinxed the team.
That's the game, you can't win forever.
Of course it's difficult, I understand the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance of winning the Euro league, I really think so.
I've always wanted to win that title, Moscow has already won the tournament, and I think this year will be CSKA.
As for the jinx, I'm not a superstitious man and I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don't have any particular rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Louis Henrique: "To me, a match with "Roma" will be special."
Louis Henrique, the head coach of the Barcelonas, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the 1st Tour of the League of Champions with a special feeling.
According to the tutor, the face-to-face struggle of his current and former team would be far from normal for him.
Remember that Louis Henrique trained the "wolves" during the 2012–1212 season, but failed to show himself to the best in the capital of Italy.
I went back to Rome a few years later, for which I had acquired some experience. -- quotes the official UEFA website of Louis Henrique.
With Rome, I have extremely warm memories.
It'll be a special game for me, but it doesn't matter.
It's about starting in the League of Champions with a win.
The Augustus meeting at the John Gomper Cup will not affect the team's actions in the nearest match.
I'm expecting a ruma game she showed in series A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that knows how to press and what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: The "Redger" has various options for attacking."
Acting Chief Trainer of the Ural, Vadim Scriptchenko, in the run-up to the 9th Tour of the League with the Transnodar, observed the variety of attack schemes of the rival team.
According to the tutor, "bows" have several models of attack in their stock.
The match will take place on 21 September and will start at 16:30 Moscow time.
As we play with the "Redmaker," let's see, it's the official "Urala" site of the word Scriptchenko.
We've got a week ahead of us.
This team has various options for attacking, and it's doing its attacks in many ways, and we're not slow, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that the Transnodar is holding a League of Europe match against the Dortmund "Borussia," we will try to prepare ourselves very well to win.
Roher Kanyas: "The House of Astana can take points from anybody."
After the 1st Tour of the League of Champions with the Benfica (0:2) champion Roger Kanyas, the quarterback of "Astana" expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
According to Hwabec, in their field, the astonishers are able to take points from any opponent.
Even though the match was hard for us, I can tell you that we played well, and that's the official UEFA website of Kanyas's words.
The Benfica is above class, but in a home match, I think we can count on taking their glasses away.
It's pretty real.
But first we need to think about Galatasarea and then we need to think about Atletico.
In home games, we can take points from anybody.
Raphael Benitez: "Repeat as many times as you want: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Raphael Benitez, the Chief Trainer of the Reals, expressed his satisfaction at the major victory in the 1st Tour of the League of Champions with the Master (4:0).
The specialist paid credit to Carried Cristiane, who was the author of three heads.
The match was difficult because "Shooter" knows how to control the ball, and it brings out the official UEFA website of Benitez's word.
The opponent did not have many moments, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I'm not saying the Real was perfect, but we've had a lot of opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss the balls and hit four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll say it all the time.
Jordy Alba: "Cristiano Ronald can't compare to Messi."
"Barcelona's defender Jordy Alba thinks that no one can compare with his same clubmate, Lionel Messi.
According to the Spanish, the foreward of the Real can't do that either.
Messi is five heads above the others, quotes Le Figaro Albu.
Not even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, things change, I can't compare him to anybody.
Daniel De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only unique styles, but also bright identities.
The Roman semi-protector Daniel De Rossi, on the eve of the match of the League of Champions with Barcelona, highlighted the importance of compaction and backup in the game with such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 2145 Moscow time.
Let's remind you, "SE" will broadcast it.
"Barcelona" is a special adversary, a good team with great players, quotes the official UEFA website De Rossi.
It's hard to play with bluegranates, because they have not only unique styles but also bright identities.
To keep them, we'll have to spend the entire match and support each other.
Messi is almost always successful when it comes to wrapping, so we need to keep compact and organized.
Yezhov hopes to be released to the start-up SKA in a match with "Slovan."
The U.S. Goldkeeper, Ilya Jezov, stressed that he hoped to be a member of the army in the next HLC championship.
Yezhov went out on the ice instead of Mikko Coskinen at the 23rd minute at a score of 0.3 and reflected all his throws at his gate, and the fourth goal was missed after replacing the goalkeeper with a sixth field player.
The next match will be held by the team on the run against Slavanov.
I hope I'll be out in the next match at the start of the game, and I say "R-Sport" to Jezov.
I'm not a gatekeeper expert, I'm a gatekeeper, and we don't have any repetitives of missing heads, so it's hard to trace.
Dinamo's been a good game, everybody's got a bad match.
The team still lost.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.
Shafarjov was hospitalized with a viral infection.
Lucie Shafarjova is hospitalized with a microbial infection, reports AFP.
At present, a Czech tennis player is in a hospital in Brno.
The time frame for the restoration of the finalist, Roland Garros 2015, is not yet known.
Also, on Monday, Shafarjova went up one line in the WTA rating and is now the fifth world racket.
Stevean Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of child abuse.
Steve Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep and registered with the Internet SMS, where he received a series of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found a missing phone and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She checked him out and found shocking photos, and immediately drew her mother's attention.
The police came and saw five images, then examined the computers found at this address and found "appropriate" queries in the search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it because it might have "attracted the paedophiles," and then he would've pretended to be a policeman to frighten them."
The authorised judge, Aileed Robertson, informed the sheriff's court in Dundee: "He said it was addiction, he was addicted to frightening people.
He admitted to making inquiries on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman to frighten paedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with the unknown person who sent him images and about asking for more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found pictures on her phone, she called her mother, trembling and crying.
She saw obscene images on her phone, and then a face-to-face bet was made with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
Hogg, aged 23, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making obscene photos of children on 14 June last year, breaking the terms of bail on 25 January this year and not appearing in court on 24 March this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sime, requested that Hogg not be listed as having committed sexual crimes, since it can be shown that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
The sheriff, Alistair Carmichael, suspended the sentence until October, pending receipt of the social services' certificates.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was taken into custody before the hearing of the other remaining cases commenced.
It had been listed as having committed sexual crimes even before the date on which the sentence was handed down.
President Robert Mugobe of Zimbabwe reads the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugobe, Africa's oldest government leader, had fallen earlier this year from the stairs leading from the runway.
He wasn't hurt, but the video with the fall scene immediately spread over social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by the statements of parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats warning them against whistling Mugobe at the time of the address.
A month ago, they mastered the President during his address to the nation in Parliament; that is exactly what Mugobe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugobe's speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but is called "Death," he informed the journalists at the end of the Mugabe speech.
It warned that immunity would end in the Parliament building and that once it came out, parliamentary immunity would not work.
The member of Parliament stated that the party led by Morgan Tswangirai was "concerned" with threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard aims to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its programme to restructure and reduce service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated reduction in jobs will cost about US$2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, as reported in Hewlett-Packard.
"This reconfiguration will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, President and Director-General of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is now, and the business profiles will be broader and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than ever to meet the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of over US$50 billion and "will focus on providing previously unattainable complex technology solutions," reported the company's application.
This is the division of a company formed in the 1930s by the graduates of the University of Oxford, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, to produce electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called the "place of birth of the Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of large-scale reconfiguration with a view to moving from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is a step by HP, the world's second personal computer manufacturer, and one of the largest technical companies in the US, the latest in this sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies work better.
Captain "Arsenal" Mikkel Arteta says that his fellows should support the injured Jack Wilshire before playing Dinamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that it was only September, and that if Wilshire's reconstruction went as planned, nothing would prevent him from returning to the Christmas game.
With the most favourable development, Wilshire will miss exactly at least four of the next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European championship next summer remains in question.
Most importantly, Wilshire finished the previous season confidently with only ankle injuries and was about to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Hungarian: "This wound is not a threat to his career."
It's just not quite the bone that's alive.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not about the ankles or the injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but as Hungarian also admitted, there is a associated risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unwelcome tendency.
According to the Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire suffered 23 different injuries during the six years since his debut.
He also played only 65 of the 150 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for the Arsenal wider, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007 to 2008, the Arsenal was one of the two premier league clubs on which the largest number of days lost due to the injuries.
Hungary acknowledges the possibility of being stuck in a vicious circle, but in the Arsenal, it is believed that improvements in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you get back in line after an injury, you've been vulnerable for a while--in that time you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage," said Hungarian.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he'll get back physically, I'm sure of it, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
The Arsenal launches a campaign at the League of Champions on Wednesday with Dinamo Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with the Chelsey and next Wednesday with the Tottenham Hotspur, and Hungarian is about to rotate the team.
Ector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Mathieu Debusi and Arteta will be playing in the start-up team.
It is possible that Wenger will also join Kieran Gibbon and Olivier Girou instead of Nacho Morel and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little rest to those players who need it," said Hungarian.
While "Arsenal" is an absolute Favorite in group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most depressing in Europe.
Dinamo hasn't lost any of the 41 games since they managed to spend the last season as "Invincible."
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake with a force of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Hungarian is confident that the Arsenal learned a lesson from last season, when the team was defeated in the Monaco League of Champions game, and remains in low hopes to lead the club to the finals of the Cup of Champions.
"It's an incredible drive," remarked Hungarian.
The Arsenal has never done this before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons in men's friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate men's need for frankness has become, now more than ever, while the suicide rate among young men has been at the highest level in 15 years.
This was the single largest cause of death between 20 and 45 years of age in the United Kingdom in 2013, and men are three times more likely to experience it than women.
In an effort to address the issue of the campaign against unhappy life, she declared 2015 as the year of men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the centre of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of over 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if the patient had enough friends in a normal mood, the chances of cure doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends halves the risk of mental illness.
But, of course, for a friendship to work, it needs to be.
In an age where communication is managed by social networks, where style prefers content, the speed of response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving fun and successful, even if loneliness is present in reality.
This superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values -- money, image, social status, entirely because of our internal values, our internal aspirations for personal growth and friendship, which have a greater impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire recently remarked, a video game maker, you don't actually buy any more happiness for money.
The merit of the Friends is that they attract attention to it.
Each character was determined not by its own work, but rather by a person who was shown to be in contact with friends.
Joe's humor and the constant embrace of Chandler, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's breath on Rachel -- all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As the employee of the "Samaritence" said to me, "my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal is to highlight how even the smallest communication of friends can be useful."
Often, those men who come to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old "live with it" lesson is strong, as well as the feeling that frank conversation about problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-functioning coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the slightest moments of male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the status of a foreigner speaking over the phone helps people in times of despair, while long-term support comes from a close circle of family and friends.
So if you're going to see FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where they've completely restored the decorations for the holiday, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or even better -- if you see a lonely man in Starbucks, smile and say hi.
You don't have to guess what the benefits of friendship can be.
The Freeds series is shown on the Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 series, by the #FriendsFest tag
Dee Mary scores a goal, helping the SVU to crush the Malmö.
Angel di Mary, along with Blaise Mathudy and Edinson Cavanaugh, celebrates beaten balls at the Malmö gate.
Angel debuted in the League of Champions and scored a goal, which allowed SWU to easily bypass the Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavanaugh did their job when "Pary St. Germain" began his game at the League of Champions with a very convenient victory of 2:0 against "Malmö" at Park de Prince Stadium on Tuesday.
Dee Mary scored the ball less than four minutes after his first match at the League of Champions as a player in order to send a direction to the champions of France, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavanaugh scored a goal for the 61st minute.
Along with the Real Madrid and the Donkey Checker in group A, PARlA had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, as they were not looking at playing-off, but at the continuation of a series of successful games during the last three seasons, where they reached quarterfinals.
They earned glasses, but at the same time, it was not the best decision of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibraikon useless in the attack and later to replace him on the field in a game against a team from his hometown and club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at home in the League of Champions, so win at 2:0, get the opponents trouble, and play well in the defence -- that's a good start, even if there are other things we need to do during the season," said Blanc.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I wish we had scored one or two more balls.
He returned after being injured in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her a 2:2 tie in a match with the Borodos in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed to the back of Di Mary for a fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was cited as a player who was able to take SVU to a new level in Europe after being bought last month from the Manchester United, and he proved why when he ran away from Marco Verratti behind the protection of the Malmö and beautifully completed the attack by sending a ball past Johann Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone then expected SWF to win easily and heavily, they had to be disappointed.
The "Malmö" that defeated Celtic in the playoff to get to this stage, with nine world-class players on the field at the beginning of the game, five advocates and two strongbacks in the middle of the field, was a serious adversary.
But, with the exception of the hit by Nicola Jurdzic, where the ball flew past Kevin Trapp's long-distance gate at the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
However, SVU sometimes failed itself with unsuccessful broadcasts and weak attacks, especially from the first half of Ibrati, who had not been able to carry out at least five attempts and then could not handle the ball that had struck Cavanaugh right after the game resumed.
However, he had shown himself much more capable in the exact pasture, and it was a pass from Ibrativich, who, Di Mary, had received the ball with a twisted blow, which had passed by his trouser by Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour's mark due to Cavanaugh, and the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrajiv had fixed the ball sent to the center of the field by Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about getting back into the game, and only the interception of the ball by Viland from a close distance prevented David Louis from raising the final score before the replacement Esequiel Lovessie had not counted the goal at the very end of the match.
Trainer "Malme" Aghe Hareide later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions took place last December."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is the wrong level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory be to Paris!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion on stock sales
The Swiss mine and trade giant Glencore, who had suffered a fall in commodity prices, had earned $2.5 billion to sell shares as part of his ambitious debt reduction plan.
Glencore, a London Stock Exchange company, announced that it had sold some £1.6 billion in new shares to pay off its debt.
A company that has lost 57 per cent of its market value is trying to cope with the collapse of commodity prices while China's economic slowdown is making demand worse and creating chaos in world markets.
With the release of new shares at a favourable price, Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange took up early morning tenders on Wednesday.
The stock rose by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which at opening was 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore started a $2.5 billion stock sale last week as part of extensive plans to reduce its 30 billion dollar debt by about a third.
The company sold 125 cents apiece of new stock, i.e. a discount of 2.4 percent to the price at the closing of the tender on Tuesday.
It posted 1.3 billion new shares, representing 9.99 per cent of the company's fixed capital.
As a result of fears about the continued decline in the Chinese economy, the value of iron ore declined by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials fell by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House acknowledges Cy Jingpin's visit to Washington.
On Tuesday, the White House confirmed in an official announcement that Chinese leader Xi Jingping would arrive with an official visit to the United States later this month.
This visit, the first visit of Cee Qingpin to Washington, D.C., will take place on 25 September and will be a follow-up visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michel Obama, will also host Cy Jingping and his wife, Pen Liuan, at a government dinner on the evening of the same day after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
"The visit of President Xi Jingping will provide an opportunity to increase cooperation between the US and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will enable US and Chinese Presidents to address the issues in a constructive manner," says the report.
It is expected that Xi Jingping, who was first announced in February, will stop in Seattle to meet with the leaders of several leading US technology companies on his way to Washington, D.C., and then go to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Cee Jingping are expected to discuss a number of issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged cyberspionage by China and China's growing categoricality on the issue of the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
The crashed biker in Kutuzovski got two years in a colony.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil suits of the victims against Denis Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
The expensive Moscow court sentenced Dani Mirzoev, who had killed a motorcyclist at the Kutuzov Prospect in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in a settlement colony.
He has been found guilty under the article “Violation of traffic rules and the use of means of transport” of the Criminal Code.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the victims' civil claims in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
During the parties' debate, the prosecutor requested that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years' imprisonment and that the victims' claims be collected in full, eight million roubles.
The incident in question took place on 22 May at about 3 a.m. in the area of home 30 on the Kutsovsky Avenue.
A BMW car, driven by Mirzoev, crossed the opposite lane and hit a motorcyclist standing on the side of the road.
A 1989-born man died of injuries.
Friends of the victim on social media reported that the driver of the BMW was driving at high speed and on the opposite track before the crash.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape responsibility, the bikers ran from the Sparrow Mountains to the Moscow GUMVD building on Petrovka, 38th.
Shortly afterwards it was reported that the investigation following the questioning had apprehended the alleged perpetrator of the accident.
A naked man was arrested in Moscow.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any illegal acts, and the police handed him over to the doctors for urgent mental health care.
The capital police arrested a resident of Moscow who had entered one of the temples without clothes.
This is reported by Moscow.
As the head of the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Moscow, Andrey Galiakberov, said, the incident occurred on Tuesday, 15 September, about 4 p.m., on the Kashire Road.
A naked man entered the Temple of Saint Nicholas.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any illegal acts.
A police detail arrived on the call.
The guards waited for doctors from the emergency mental health unit and handed them over to a man.
They turned out to be a 26-year-old Moscow resident.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakušev.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by the governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakušev, at a meeting of the Regional Government Presidency.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds to educational and health-care institutions in the district.
In particular, funds have been allocated for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in the Nizhenetavo district and for the major maintenance of the district hospital in the Kasan region.
As indicated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major maintenance of the second floor of the therapeutic department.
The repair of the hot and cold water networks, the diversion of water, electricity and electrical equipment, and the venting systems will be carried out, the facade of the building will be rebuilt, the premises will be renovated and a range of fire and energy conservation activities will be carried out.
Sochi will host the second Forum of the Regions of Russia and Belarus.
From 17 to 18 September, the second Forum of the Regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, with the participation of a Tunisian delegation led by the Governor.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of the cooperation are described by the honourable Consul-General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumenia, Vladimir Sugla, who joined the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorowicz, what are the tasks of the Sochi Forum?
The large event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on the productive cooperation of the regions, the important links between the two States.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Poetin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, are scheduled to attend the plenary.
The session will focus on the experience of the Russian and Belarusian regional and local authorities in the implementation of industrial policies, regulations and programs of the Union State.
The Forum will be attended by the governor of the Tumen region.
I think this is evidence of successful, sustainable cross-regional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The Forum will also be attended by representatives of relevant ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian businessmen.
Trade fairs and special exhibitions will be held, including from the Tumen region.
I hope that the Forum will help to conclude new and favourable contracts and arrangements.
I will add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than 200 participants took part in the work, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At that time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between the Tumen region and the Minsk region.
The importance of our work is also reflected in the fact that a meeting of a permanent workshop at the parliamentary meeting of the Union of Russia and Belarus took place in Tumen.
In addition, a delegation of the Tumen region's APC has visited Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training for farming, to identify additional areas of contact and to organize new investment projects in the agri-agriculture sector.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakusev spoke of the region's cooperation with the Republic of Belarus under current difficult circumstances.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian farming equipment and the use of financial mechanisms will be addressed; they are needed to reduce the cost of machines to the end-user.
Discussions were held on the problems in the work of the Silshina Tunisian shopping house and options for preventing loss.
The issues are important, as investment projects must work clearly and generate profit for the region.
Reference was made to the continued supply of the OAO passenger and cargo equipment "MAZ" and the development of the OAO service centre "MASE" which was set up in the OAO-based Tumeni "TPTP".
The discussion also concerned the preparation of a visit by the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of this year.
Another theme of the discussion was the completion and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific and cultural cooperation between the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamic of relationships promises to rise to a new level.
These questions also concerned the Regional Centre.
During our meeting with the head of the city of Tumene, Alexander Moor, we talked about renovating the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already "breathing on the moor," so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required to work on gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect is that the Tumen elevator plant is working with one of the leading U.S. elevators manufacturer, Mogileviftmash, to obtain components.
In my view, this could be more active, given the new elevators programme at the district centre.
In addition, within the framework of the extended  Consul's powers, a meeting was held with the governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Cocorin, during which the issue of increased trade and the supply of modern Belarusian technology in Zauralya was discussed.
A meeting with the Omian governor is scheduled for late September.
There are five members of the Russian Federation in the Expanded Consular District, but Tumen is a district's capital.
The region is a site for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Gent Consul.
Generally speaking, such meetings are both relevant and good in order to address the many problems directly and quickly, reducing their severity and promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the present circumstances, it is vital that we keep on working for the future.
Matt damon doesn't want to focus on the ethnic diversity of people engaged in film production.
Matt damon argued with the African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that there was no need to consider ethnic composition.
During the Sunday release of the Project Greenlight on HBO, a famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to highlight the need for alternative views on the main black hero in the design scenario.
"Multipleness is appropriate when you cast for the film itself, not for the show," he insisted.
Brilliant Brown, in spite of her ears, exclaimed "Wow, wow, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
The finalists of the show were joined by their production colleagues, Ben Affleck, and the Farnelly brothers.
"I'd like the participants--no matter who the director is--to think about the way Harmony looks they're going to follow," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a hooker beaten by a white pimp.
The film's production of "Dear White People" was for Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to become directors; he was strongly opposed to saying that "we may not get what we want as a result."
After this discussion was broadcast on television, social networks exploded with disapproving comments to daemon.
Twitter user MrPooni angryly spoke about the video: "Exploring the nature of the variety from Matt daemon to the only black man in the room that hurts so much."
Twitter has scored more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 licks.
David's comments appear just when the most pressing issue on the agenda of the public debate is the well-documented media coverage of race.
After a youth named Michael Brown was shot by a policeman in 2014 the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, calling on the lawmakers and the authorities to stop discriminating against the coloured population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the "Albom of the Year" candidates at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"Alboms still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Most recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued a formal statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck as to whether the group would be treated as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," reported the leaders of the movement.
Recently, it was announced that Damon had been listed as a member of the show business, production and mediamagnets who had been invited to visit the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unknown whether the actor accepted the invitation and met the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" rewards the first champion
The professional climber and waiter's assistant, Isaac Caldiero, was the first winner of the "American Ninja Warrior" show on Monday night, taking home the $1 million prize.
At this sporting show, which just ended its seventh season, none of the participants have ever been able to get through every stage of the road with obstacles.
In the finals of the season, two participants, Caldier and the cameraman, Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task was to climb a rope 75 feet long in 30 seconds.
Brittany was the first to perform the task and to complete the task in the right time, becoming the first athletic in the history of the American Ninja Warrior, which had passed through the exhausting phase of 4 but Caldiero had completed the task three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After winning with incredible labor, Caldiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview with "E!News".
"It's incredible to think about it, because I've never made or lived for more than $10,000 a year," I remarked to journalists E! such a serious leap in income.
And then all of a sudden... I never imagined how it would be... the future is unknown.
Executive Producer Kent Wid met with journalists from The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Brittany, who first passed the track, would not get any money.
According to the rules, money gets the fastest bidder.
"If the finishing players are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them," said Wheed.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still enjoys great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels offended about it.
He's happy with what he did.
He got a ton of excited fan feedback.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "if I was meant to lose, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we changed our roles.
"America Ninja Warrior" will come back with season eight, which will be released in the spring of 2016.
"Detroth Tigers" quietly beats Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers is now ranked last in the Central Division of the American League.
The odds are just to be an obstacle, and the Tigers have won a brilliant win at Minnesota Twins on Tuesday, with a total of 5-4 at Targetfield.
The Twins missed the chance to reduce by half the game the huston Astros lag and to take second place in the playoffs after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was a return of the word to the letter F, which slipped away most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they work," said the manager of the Tigers, Brad Osmus.
Pitcher "Tigers" by Alfredo Simon made his contribution to support the attacks, as a result of which Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added another one in the sixth and the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third high-quality start in nine exits.
"I just want to end the year with good scores," said Simon.
Pitchers don't get to quit every game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
Victor Martinez, who was appointed to beat the Tigers, was able to beat back three blows and hit two wounds, the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three blows since the four strikes in the game against Sittle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with a bat," said Osmus.
He's shown himself well in (batter quality), noticeably better in battling and kept that quality for the game.
After three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to get back into the game.
The central receiver, Byron Buxton, opened the inning with a doll on the left side of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making the Bant, took the first base, and the second baseman, Brian Dozier, got a strike out at Simon's swing before his place was taken by Blaine Hardy, the left-hander.
Hardy beat Moira, the only player in the way, before the newly appointed fighter, Michael Sano, who hit a two-way single to the left of right-hand Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of earlys not in out and a comparing wound on Verhagen's second base, it was possible for him to lead the third baseman to a double-playing.
It was the 27th time for a top league player this season, when Pluff hit the ball on a double-play.
After Detroit added a backup wound in the first half of the 9th inning, Moyer got a RBI "dubbed" into the space between the outfillers against Bruce Rondon's closing pitcher, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-hand player beat Sano up after three strikes and got his fifth Seive.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily untrained Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
The Tigers made three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the list of injured until the game itself, missing for more than a month due to the inflammation of his back.
"Surely not the start I'd like," said Hughes, "but as the game developed, I began to feel more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots at the third inning."
After the first batter got to the first base, Hughes threw a single to Ian Kinsler's second base.
Wook at the two outs of Ritzfielder J.D. Martinez led Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his "0 for 21" series with an early start in an effective position.
The third base player, Nick Castellanos, followed by a "syngle" with another wound, but Victor Martinez was shot out in an attempt to get close to the third base, thus removing the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning, getting a single-out "dub" from the catcher James McCann and a double-out single from the central beater Anthony Gose, and that became 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager "Twins" Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got right at the right point.
Hughes, whose throws were believed to have been thrown in an unbalanced third inning, was replaced by A. J. Achter's right-hand relier.
Hughes was counted as three wounds per six hits and a four-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-square-squa
Note: The Pitcher right-hand "Tigers" Anibal Sánchez retired from the players due to the right shoulder stretch.
He'll be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had performed a shoulder surgery on Sanchez since 2007.
For Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured since mid-August, it is scheduled to launch on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, a left-wing pitcher, Daniel Norris, will leave the list of injured persons and turn out against the Twins.
Norris, who has been with the Tigers in four startups since it was acquired in exchange for David Price's left-hand pitcher on July 30, has 1 win and 1 defeat.
He hasn't played since August 20, due to the spraining of his muscle.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish a series of three games at the Targetfield on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be playing Ervin Santana's right-wing pitcher (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original Cadyrov complaint for the book "Molba to God" went to the South Pacific Court.
The South Pacific City Court received an original appeal from the President of Chechen, Ramzan Kadyrov, against the decision to recognize the "extremist material" of the book "Molba to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam," by Interfax, referring to the President of the Gorge of Alexander Chuhrai.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the participants in the trial.
Chuhri refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the State Duma of the Russian Federation concerning the need to test the hillside for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIL.
"Let yourself comment on such nonsense," he said.
On 11 September, the South Pacific City Procuracy filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
A complaint came in from the South Sakhalinska prosecutor's office on Friday night.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they have requested the court to declare extremist only the author's opinion rather than the Koran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision," reported Chuhrai.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was made on 12 August 2015.
In particular, "extremist" quotes from the Koran, "We worship thee, and we pray for Your help," and "Do not call upon anyone along with Allah."
Cadastre called the decision-makers on the book "Shitans and Provocators".
He called for a legal ban on court decisions concerning the holy writings.
"I firmly believe that the State Duma must pass a law under which it is prohibited to take judicial decisions concerning the specific texts of the Koran and other divine writings," wrote the Cadyr in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments insulting immigrants and refugees
Facebook staff intend to remove posts and comments that have negative impact on immigrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about illegal content.
The Facebook leadership, together with the German Ministry of Justice, intended to combat xenophobic and racist acts on the network.
Thus, the previous day, the head of the Haiko Maas department said that the Ministry was currently working with social media professionals to set up a special group of monitors.
It is the responsibility of the participants to monitor and remove comments that are not appropriate to immigrants and refugees.
According to Hayko Maasa, it is assumed that the authors of untrusted posts will receive notifications indicating the reason why they are deleted.
Organizations whose professionals collect complaints from social media users about insulting posts should also help to quickly block illegal content.
The Facebook management intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts that had negative effects on immigrants and refugees, the management of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice had been taken after the German segment of Facebook had sharply increased xenophobic attitudes.
One of the most obvious reasons for this was the unprecedented migration crisis that struck the European Union some time ago.
For example, Germany is already overcrowded with all the places intended for hosting refugees.
On the eve of the month, the authorities decided to temporarily settle the immigrants in the former Kochenwald concentration camp.
Forced settlers from the Middle East and Africa are placed in baracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
There will be relaxation areas in Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries will be equipped with special areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first are the Boutovski, Domodediski, and Shcherbinski Cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troekur Cemetery in Moscow.
Other areas of the city will be affected.
Artem Yekimov, the head of the State Budget Institute, Ritual, spoke about this portal.
The relaxation areas will be small green areas like parks.
According to experts, in such corners, visitors to the cemeteries will be able to rest, be alone and regain psychological strength.
The relaxation zones will soon be built in Domodedos, Butovs and Shcherbinski cemeteries and then in other parts of the capital.
According to the GU "Ritual" chapter, if there is a need to expand the cemetery, the builders will try to keep the existing woodlands as large as possible.
Green soils will serve as a living fence that divides the areas of rest and squares reserved directly for burial sites.
The GBU experts from the Ritual also indicated their intention to make a proposal to remove fences from the graveyards.
The new cemeteries can indeed become barren.
In addition, in GBU Ritual, the willingness to install electronic terminals by which visitors to the cemeteries would be able to identify GPS coordinates and registration plates for burials was announced.
In June of this year, the Ritual also offered to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of the year.
So digging a grave in summer time will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the earth is frozen.
Note that in the past year, the cost of all forms of ritual services has averaged 10 percent.
Five days later, a lost mushroom was found in the woods.
The elderly man was alive, although he had spent more than a hundred hours in the woods without food.
The rescue team and volunteers have been able to find the mountain-grid.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old retired man from the Tambo region spent five days in the woods."
No food or water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even movie writers with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after the helicopter was involved in the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexanderich went as usual to the woods to pick up the spotlights and the submersibles, but was not back by evening.
The relatives immediately requested help, and the following day rescue workers and interested people from the neighbouring village were raised to find a mushroom, with only about 30 people.
A fire and rescue centre helicopter joined them for the fifth day.
Andrey Seletkov, the head of the search and rescue team of the Smolen Oblast Fire and rescue centre, said, "The helikopter has been attracted, a man has been found."
He's gone very far, quite elsewhere.
It was about 12 miles from the search site.
He passed a great distance at his age.
It's a miracle he's alive.
The mushroom was taken to the county district hospital unconsciously, in a very difficult condition.
He was diagnosed with pneumonia as well as severe dehydration and refrigeration.
As an elderly man was able to survive after five days in the woods, doctors have no idea.
Valentina Nelasha, head of the CPU CPU Therapeutic Department: "Personal examination, treatment."
Infuse therapy, anti-bacterial.
Given all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved this morning, and it's still difficult, but positive.
Vitalia Alexanderowicz, a retired man, comes to Smilencia every year from Tambo oblast.
His grandson said that Grandpa had previously gone to pick mushrooms, but far into the woods had never been deeper.
Alexei Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroomster, said, "Fores are not far from the road, they're not actually local."
Just a few years ago, I came to visit my family.
So he went to get the mushrooms.
I guess it went a little far and lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all parts of the Smolen region.
In the last few days alone, there have been five similar cases.
The rescuers remind us that we need to walk into the woods in bright clothes, with little food, matches, and compass.
Moreover, it is desirable to leave traces behind so that you can then return.
The emergency An-2 sat down in the middle of a brother's taiga.
Right across the street in Siberia, emergency An-2.
An emergency landing took place by the Jenisei Redyar Airlines 68 miles from Bratsk.
There were no casualties, but the plane itself suffered considerable damage upon landing.
An-2 was on a service flight.
It had three crew members on board, a commandant, a co-pilot and a flight mechanic, reporting to Interfax.
The crash plane flew along the route of the railway of Cernogornogorsk-Ilimski-Achinsk, where the company is based.
The flight crew has already arrived in Bratsk.
Following the emergency landing of An-2, the brother's transport prosecutor's office began to verify the implementation of flight safety laws.
An investigation team from the East Siberian Transport Office was on its way to the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their plane with passengers due to a technical failure on an abandoned secret airport in Komi.
Engines and on-board electronics failed on the ship, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
News of the economy -- Nobel laureate: Globalisation
Globalisation processes should have contributed to reducing inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, and the income gap in the developing world is on the contrary growing.
Eric Muskin.
In order to remedy this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, considered by Eric Muskin, Chief Researcher of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-making, the 2007 Nobel Prize winner for Economics.
Over the past 20 years, the world has experienced an extraordinary increase in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more and more open.
Proponents of globalisation have predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," stressed Maskin.
For example, China and India have experienced a serious per capita GDP growth.
However, not everything is so cheerful.
It was expected that globalisation would narrow the gap between the “poor” and the “poor” in poor countries, which is reflected in large income inequality and, more precisely, pay.
But in fact this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Muskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in emerging economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by the INE.
Together with economist Michael Kremer, professor at Harvard University, Eric Muskin has developed an alternative theory that illustrates why income differences in poor countries are increasing as globalisation grows, like the INE of the World.
The new global market is experiencing specific processes.
To show them, Maskin has four levels of skills -- A and B for rich countries, C and D for poor countries.
After globalisation, poor countries' D professionals lack skills to work with rich countries' A and B professionals.
And if employees at Level C from poor countries are growing because of the collaboration with employees at Level B from rich countries, then employees at Level D are not feeling growth or their wages are falling altogether.
The result is that the internationalization of production will widen the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus increase inequality.
Cremer and E. Muskin are presented with an amazingly beautiful model, alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It makes it possible to explain why globalisation has led to income inequality, says Fouad Alesserov, a regular professor in the International Analysis and Solutions Laboratory, and the head of the INE Mathematics Department.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a splash of empirical work in this field.
The solution, according to Eric Muskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, workers themselves, according to the scholar, do not have the means to do so, and companies do not want to pay for their education.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NPOs and private foundations can play a significant role, according to Maskin.
The scholar notes that the theory that has been developed does not in any way call for a halt to the process of globalisation, which has brought about and has borne fruit in the form of GDP growth in countries.
Durbent: A living connection of time.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, is celebrating its 2000th birthday in September.
In the holiday program, the Daguestan National Cultures Festival and the ancient festival, the Derbent carpet exhibition and the Open Temples Day, the "2000 Two Hours Musical Show" and the guided tours to the rebuilt Petra I Museum.
The medieval rocks of the fortress of Naryn-Cala, ancient Arabic inscriptions on walls, narrow streets and palace gardens -- all of this is like coming from the pages of "The Thousands and One Night."
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in its place since ancient times.
Although the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Hazar Caganate and the Golden Orde had claimed him.
The age of the East Platinum, which grows in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mechets, is a few centuries old.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russia Wildlife Monuments Program.
The shadow of scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitor will be served with a flavour of tea and adorned with adornment, such as honeyfig, furma, musmule, jewels, ayran and sweets.
In Derbenth, they've been using large savages for centuries to drink tea at once to many guests.
The inscription above the entrance to Juma's dream suggests that the building was built in 115 hedgehogs.
This is the year 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
This is the oldest Moslem in Russia.
The interior is astonished by the scale and solemnity of the arcades of the domes and coves, which are based on square columns and lighted with light from tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is a traditional passion for the inhabitants of Derbent.
The owners of pet birds put pigeons in the yards, under trees, on attics.
An exciting sight is the rise in the sky of a pack of white pigeons, similar to the explosion of a holiday firework.
For the purpose of defending the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Cape gate with a double stone wall.
As it went 500 meters into the sea, it locked Derbent's harbor.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Dunbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of the ancient Persian fortification.
The carpets in Derbent were weaving in the fifth century, and the technology of this unique trade has remained almost unchanged until now.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for any taste, i.e. wool, blossom, or bark of all colours and shades, with a worm and without it, with a complex oracle and a queer price.
The building of the city began with the malls, blocks with single-storey stone buildings.
Over the years, the landlords have hardly changed.
Only satellite plates, air conditioners on walls, and street lights remind us that you are not in the Middle Ages, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, there were still details of the plumbing built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
To date, ancient sources of water have reached the local population.
Many derbents prefer the water from the cranes to the water from the verified historical fountains.
There was one of the centers of pottery in Derbent.
Filled and signed bowls, dishes, pitchers, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The pottery's hands are still producing wonderful ceramic products for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On holidays and festivals, crowds are gathered under a stretched couch at which students from the Republican Academy of Circulatory Art are featured.
The history of extraordinary and risky skill has been for centuries.
A new tendency is that girls are more likely to be seen among climbers.
There's a museum called "Culture and the Beta of Ancient Derbent" in the ex-Girl bath room today.
There used to be unmarried girls and brides, accompanied by girlfriends, and now anyone who wants to see a cottage hall, a hot and cold pool, gone into the past bathing appliance.
Most Durbent houses have hot water, but baths and steam are popular these days as they were in the old days.
The benefits of warming the body with the ferry are written in ancient books.
After bathing, blood improves, muscles become tired, and the body becomes flexibly and lightly.
The Commonwealth festival, which is being held in Naryn Kala fortress, is attended by the ethno-villages of many parts of Daguestan.
The participants in the national costumes dance, play folk tunes, sing the songs of the people of the Caucasus, and treat visitors with tasty home cheese.
Kirchler is the site of the grave of forty martyrs who have hunted their heads for Islam.
This is one of the most admired complexes for North Caucasus Muslims.
The occasionally yellowed sarcophages are carved out of solid stone blocks and are, as is customary in the Arabs, oriented along the west-east axis.
The brothers Gabriel and Albert Jacob cut and shave their clients in a small salon near the Upper Market.
The barber's been in this place for years.
The receptions of the civil trade are passed from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubowa brothers can do not only traditional but also modern hair.
On one of the streets of the Old City, there was a house in which the writer-decabrist Alexander Bestujev-Marlinsky, exiled to the Caucasus, lived.
After learning Turkic and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, his life, and his citizens.
Teahan is a traditional East club where only tea and homemade bakes are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, talk to friends, and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not recommended to cross the threshold of tea.
The Derbent dance company "Caspius" was created three years ago, but it was already possible to take part in national and Russian events.
The Solitaires of the Ensemble rehearse every day, mastering the perfect folk dances of the desert, the Darginian, the Tatian, the Armenian.
As the evening arrives, when noise and street lights are lighted, the locals are placed on berries near the houses of the prowling terraces.
Usually, Derbents discuss domestic matters.
But in the run-up to the anniversary, they are reminiscent of episodes of the unique history of their city, which has affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Cape region.
There was a business airport game in Domodedo.
A new form of education is being introduced in the capital.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport officers.
For this, a model of three aircraft has been installed in Domodedo.
Young people not only searched and registered passengers but also served planes.
It's all in the form of a business game, but the complexity of it has not given way to reality.
Late flights, at once two passengers with cracks on board, the stairs were lost somewhere along the way to the plane.
For a real airport, hell.
For the one who settled in Domodedonov's hangar, it's the standard set of tasks to be done by newcomers.
In one hangar, three large airports from around the world were located simultaneously.
They employ four hundred students from capital colleges and universities today.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn everything about the air-haven's internal world.
The registration of passengers, the maintenance of aircraft and the traffic in luggage - even buses on the flightfield, stairs and passenger searches were entrusted to them.
And passengers are a lot of trouble.
One had a problem with the documents, the other had missed the flight, and the other had filled the bag with suspicious objects.
And you have to deal with all this, like in life, at the minimum.
They are paid a certain amount of virtual money for each of these tasks, as if they had been paid by the airfaring company for the maintenance of the flight.
"They're fined for failing to do this," explained the Financial Analyst of the game, Dmitry Gilko, in an interview with the "Westy-Moscow" program.
This is being closely followed by officials from the Ministry of Education.
For them, this exam is an attempt to test the new form of education.
She's already got a job in high school.
"Six cross-regional centres of competence will be formed, which will essentially become new models for modern colleges with modern management systems, highly skilled staff, and modern equipment," says Natalia Zolotaryev, Director of State Policy in the area of training and complementary professional education of the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation.
But students don't have global plans.
After three days of training, they seem to need a day off.
However, the scores for this exam were quite material.
The newest smarts, the best I've ever seen!
"I've got them for responding promptly to our Instagram airport claim," satisfied the player, the PR manager of the "Frankfurt Airport" team, Sergei Shuvalov.
The best judges, called the pencil, were taken to invite them to work by the time they finished their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closing of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed its regret at the closing of the library's foreign literature at the American Centre.
The Centre has been in Moscow for over 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian government's one-sided decision to shut down the U.S. United States Empress Center at the M.I. Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
“The single-party steps taken recently by the Russian Federation call into question the Russian government's commitment to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the cold war and at other difficult moments of the long history of our countries' relations,” states the statement made by the United States Ambassador John Tefft to Interfax.
The American Centre has created deep and strong links between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital and served as a meeting place with numerous American prominent figures, including astronauts, artists, sportsmen, researchers, politicians and writers.
"Only last year, the American Centre held more than 400 cultural and educational events and hosted over 50,000 Russian visitors," stressed the briefcase.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Educational Exchange Program.
The Green Tribunal proved to be quick to kill.
Typical situation: four officials stand at the table of Judge Swattanter Kumar, listening to his grievances about the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of it," Kumar said.
If any more bricks are placed, we'll order you to tear down all the existing structures.
Kumar is the head of the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial body established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution of the environment, which has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal had managed to address more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geology, toxic waste and the construction of dams.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: India has become one of the world's most overcrowded and polluted countries in the 60 years since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development.
The problem is particularly acute in large mega-cities, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from businesses and households, and few remaining habitats are cut off for new neighbourhoods.
Despite the formal support of the State for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main reason for cancelling major investment projects.
Thus, in May this year the Minister of the Environment called the court's decisions “extreme” and “implementable”.
Sometimes the court's decisions cannot be executed within the time limit set by the court is confirmed by Raj Panjwani's environmental lawyer.
However, an impossible deadline has a positive side: at least it makes responsible persons move.
"His primary purpose is to shake this system," adds counsel.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled large structures: it accounts for the termination of the airport, the power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
People are also tried to keep in mind: for example, during discussions on the fate of a drug company in Telagnan, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can shut down your factory, but we're responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," comments Kumar.
However, such explanations are far from always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by the same gesture of a judicial pen.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, causing public outrage.
Despite a sharp fall in popularity and criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to cancel the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the New Delhi government on the in and out of the car, and offered to buy 10,000 additional buses, before they found out at the factories whether they were able to carry out such an order.
As sources of pollution such as dumps, fuel quality and even road incidents began to come to the attention of the court, popular anger began to slow down a little.
But the most painful theme of the principled judge was the Ganges River Clean-up Program, which was announced last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for the Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and starts shouting.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges onto the statue of God, and there were feces in it,--the judge is hot.--
You keep contaminating the river because you think the Ganges is the Ganges, he'll take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and look what you do to it every day.
Cleaning up the Ganges is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecals in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 Indians bathing in it die each year from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Gang Save Foundation money from selling his costume, where he met Barack Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.

Xi Jingping calls for making the economy more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to boost its growth, as President Xi Jingping said on Tuesday in addressing the group that faces the challenge of managing the reforms.
"China must focus on engaging foreign investors and experts and develop an open policy," he said, addressing the participants at the 16th meeting of the Central Lead Group Committee on the Intensification of Reforms.
He said that greater openness and deeper reform would give the economy a new impetus and vitality and a new space for economic development.
The lead group had adopted a number of policies, including regulating investor access to the market, changing border controls, encouraging State-owned companies (SOE) to attract private capital and revising the registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will gradually re-establish through pilot programs.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more meaningful role in resource allocation, business rule and transparency, as the statement states.
The government will also weaken control over the powers given to companies, thus guaranteeing that companies will run their own businesses.
The statement also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to increase local growth.
More areas would be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of government-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign finance and provide them with better conditions," states the statement.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for aliens, or a Green Card, will be further eased by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
