I'm not a girl anymore.
I want to, Tom, it's mine.
We need to know what we're doing.
I didn't do anything.
What book did I read?
I've got my bike.
It tastes good.
I'm a man. I want to marry him.

Tom said he wanted to stay home all day.
Will milk be milked?
I'll shoot him.
It's a good friendship.
I've been hiding in a house all day.
We've won.
Tom doesn't have a home.
I can't find my keys.
Is that true?
Tom speaks German rather than English.
Don't be angry.
He shook my hand.
Are you in Hebrew?
I've come to the U.S. Defense.
I don't know if I love you.
Yeah, Tom, you're right.
I'm taking care of you.
Have you gone yet?
We're alone.
Does he have a brother?
The apples are green, green, or beautiful.
I've already written to Tom.
Did you manage to talk to Tom?
Bye!
What are you talking about panda's?
He's not talking to Tom, but he's not talking to her.
I don't trust you.
Hans is a German name.
He's a student.
She's got him.
I was asleep.
I didn't know Tom was like that.
I get up at six, but I get up at six.
I didn't know it either.
What did he do to him?
Don't you hurt me?
Are you a girl or a boy?
We need to buy vinegar.
What are you doing here?
I didn't have a shower.
I'm not from Boston.
Why did you buy these?
I want to go home.
Mary was the only one.
Tom smokes.
Are you coming to our place soon?
