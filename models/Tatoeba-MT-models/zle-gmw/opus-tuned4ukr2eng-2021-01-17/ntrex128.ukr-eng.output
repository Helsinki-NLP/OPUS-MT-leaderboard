Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that they will be “associating with the Mappets ”
Some CSAs are horrified by the recommendation to change their title to “A member of the Parliament of Wales ” (MWP).
This recommendation came about through plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Parliament of Wales".
WHEN all the political spectrum is concerned, it can make fun of you.
One of the Laborists claimed that his group was concerned about the rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "unintelligible", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
THE Wales Party said that his group was generally "not satisfied" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said that his group was “insensitive ” about changing the name, but noted that MWP could quickly become a“ mappet. ”
In this context, the Welsh word "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English word "u".
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently developing legislation to change names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be taken by the members themselves. ”
The Welsse Self - Order Act of 1951 gives the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly into the Welss Parliament received wide support.
As for what's called the CA, the commission suggests that they be called the "WMP members of the Parliament of Wales," or WMP, but the MWP version has received the greatest public support.
Of course, the TA offers alternatives, but trying to agree can cause problems for headlin Jones, who has to submit a change bill for a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including the rules of rejection of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
THE final vote on their new name will be held when legislation is discussed.
The Macedonians are going to vote for a review of the change in the name of the country
On Sunday, the election vote is to change the name of the country to the Northern Macedonia Republic.
The vote was organized to resolve a long - term dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim in the territory of Greece, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposes a renaming conference, stated that he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, the representatives of the cabinet, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, say that the change in the name is just the price that you have to pay for the EU and NATO.
Call St. Martin silently, because the Harlem Churches are going through difficult times.
“The old people I've been talking to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner, ” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither."
He believes that it's clear that bars are gone:
“In modern times, people are becoming socialized in a different way.
Bars are no longer the local living room where they regularly go."
As for the churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and “they will be where they started sooner or later. ”
The churches, he added, could replace houses with condominiums, and there would be people who would not help the shrines nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” Adams explained, “so this will speed up the day when all these churches will close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to the condominiums will become their parishioners. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Communal Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin was built ten years later.
The original white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community, which held rituals nearby, obtained the right to own the building.
Saint-Martin moved to the black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the 125th Street dealers, Harlem's main trading street, who refused to hire blacks and raise them in the service.
In 1939 the fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners wanted to rebuild it and set up a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Johnson's father in St. Martin, proudly called the Carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the Carillon in July called it a different term, “Cultural Treasure ” and“ Unchangeable Historical Instrument. ”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that this is the world's first carillon played by black musician Dionysio A. Linde, who 18 years ago moved to the larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivester, he was never replaced in St. Martin.
What's going on in Saint-Martin over the last few months is a complicated story about architects and subscribings, some of whom have been involved by church leaders, others by bishops.
The Council, the governing body of the parish, which is made up of the leaders of the peace, wrote the diocese in July, concerned that the diocese would “try to pass on the expenses ” to the council, while the council did not participate in the hiring of the architects and substitutives sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that there was no transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shakula injured a 13-year-old boy who peeled behind lobsters in California.
According to official figures, on Saturday, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, and the boy plucked behind the lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place almost 7 a.m. at Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that Saturday morning he had spent about half an hour with his friends when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and along with the group sailed to get him out of the water.
Hummel at first thought it was just a thrill to catch a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, "I've been bitten!
I got bit.
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his collarbone was completely broken.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, 'A shark in the water!' he added.
The boy was taken to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
The rescue captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in this area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper part of the body.
For investigation and security purposes, 48 hours of access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swam in Encinitas was blocked by the authorities.
Giles noted that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's going to compete with Bots, Superdrug, and Debenhams by means of island-like cosmetics like the ones in the department store.
As part of the increased entry into the British cosmetics market at a cost of 2.8 billion pounds [2.8 billion pounds [2.8 billion pounds [2.8 billion pounds [2.8 billion pounds]] [as the sale of clothing and household goods continues] decreases], the increased island with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country, and in the following year, if the idea turns out to be successful, the island will appear in other stores.
The investment in cosmetics is that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the space that was used on television, microwave furnaces, and household goods.
Sayinsbury's said they'd double the assortment of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 brands, including the first brands of Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PowPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Mybelline, and Burt's Bees will get more space: brand areas like Bots will appear.
Supermarket also updates Botique’s cosmetic assortment: Now most of the goods presented will not be tested on animals, which are increasingly demanded by young buyers.
And also, the scavenger of France Shope protestes his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, northern London, last week, and the second one opens at Sally-Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and moving to the purchase of small amounts of food every day in small shops make supermarkets make extra effort to attract visitors.
Mike Coope, executive director of the Sunsbury's, said that their stores would look more like department stores, because the supermarket network is trying to resist Aldi and Lidl Discounters with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's open the Argos Departments in hundreds of their stores, also open a series of Habitats.Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claimed that it increased sales of food goods, and made both networks more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to update the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals sections failed.
Sainsbury's tested Bots' cooperation in the early 2000s, but it ended with a debate about how to divide the profits from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sáinsbury's sold their pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) to Célesio, the owner of the Loyds Pharmacy network, for £125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Loyds would help by adding an extended suite of leather brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vicky, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of the Sunsbury, stated: “We have changed the appearance of our island with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasing to the buyers.
We also invested in specially trained counselors who would be able to give advice.
The brand assortment we offer is designed to satisfy any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is the competition of the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "scattered" because Holly Willoughby came out of a deal worth 11 million pounds.
The Dragon Liver star Peter Jones is "scattered" because Holly Willoughby's TV conduit broke out with his brand of goods for life (the contract cost is 11 million pounds sterling) to focus on new regulations from Marks & Spacer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for a brand of house clothes and axes of Truly.
The couple's business was connected to the brand of Goop Guinett Peltrow.
37-year-old programmer This Morning announced her departure for Instagram.
Holly Willoughby led Peter Jones to the story when at the last moment, she came out of their lucrative business of goods for life to focus on the new lucratives of Marks & Spacer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is “scattered ” when a gold girl on TV confessed at a busy Tuesday meeting at the Johns business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements, worth £1.5 million, mean that she no longer has enough time to dedicate his joint brand of house clothes and axes of Truly.
This business was connected to the brand of Goop Guinett Peltrow and had to double the value of Willoughby, which is estimated to be 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby told Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his rest homes.
The source reported: “Truly no doubt was Holly’s chief priority.
He was to be her long - term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to quit business was astonished by all interested parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
At Marlow headquarters, there's a complete set of things ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the entry of Lead This Morning, one of Britain’s most highly paid stars, could cost firms millions because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes) and create further delay at startup.
This may also mean the end of long friendships.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Boldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp created True in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the board in March.
The couple held the festivals together, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of a company called Waldwin, which is involved in television production.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as lead I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
Hard conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he would get from news media for commenting on what someone would think to be “non-presiding, ” and for the very positive attitude toward the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make such a big deal? ”
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news announcer. —
I didn't go to anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step toward deuclarization in North Korea.
But the negotiations on deuclarization were in a debugged corner.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s leading North Korean missionary, Young Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a “responsibility ” from the United States for its early disarmament efforts.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to carry on with the pressures.
Trump was much more optimistic in giving a talk at his meeting.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea, ” he stated.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions would be killed.
Now we have such a beautiful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kimom had produced positive results: the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remaining American military officers to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this bit of a packed stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of it.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake in Lomboca, foreign non - government organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the people in Lomboca were affected, the national catastrophe was not declared, and this is a prelude to international aid.
“ In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it is a little difficult, ” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Pale, it is not yet known if foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Reduction Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Pala to determine whether international organizations could provide assistance.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains horrendously unprepared for the wrath of nature.
In the province of Aceh, tsunami shelters are built, but they are not characteristic of other coastlines.
The apparent absence of a tsunami alarm in Pala, even though the warning was active, likely contributed to death.
Traveling between a multitude of Indonesian islands is not simply at the best of times.
Natural disasters make logic even more difficult.
A medical ship in Lomboca to treat earthquake victims sails to Pala, but at least three days from now it will be possible to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the infrastructure of Indonesia the basis of his election campaign and increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the financial deficit has created problems for Mr. Joko’s administration, who is planning to change in the following year.
Mr. Joko is also hindered by continued interfaith in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands of people hanging from their homes, as a result of opposition from Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets, using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

A lot of people are trapped in debris of buildings that were destroyed during the Friday earthquake with a seven and a half points, which caused a wave of six meters high, and reported to the press secretary of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palou, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was swept by wreckage of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was killed to death.
The murder investigation began after the woman’s body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Mercisside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with a stab wound at Stone-Muse, John Street, suspected of murdering a 32-year-old man.
The police urged people who had seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who could make a video recording, to contact us, because the information in these videos can be very important to our investigation.
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
Today, in the afternoon, friends who feel they know a woman have come to the scene of the crime to ask where they found her this morning.
The investigation continued, and the police said that they were now reporting to the victim’s closest relatives.
The taxi driver who lives in the London Times just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police said that no one was allowed to go into and out of the house.

Cromwell's statue near Parliament becomes a new monument that will be affected by "the rewrite of history"
The removal of the statue would be a well deserved retribution for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritans.
But Cromwell's community called Mr. Creek's offer "unclear" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of Cromwell Communicate, said: “Because of the current debate about the removal of statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace was inevitable. ”
Iconocracy in English civil wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his orders.
Cromwell is likely to be undeserved sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell's great statue of sculptor William Hamo Thorneicroft is a testimony to the 19th century's moods and a part of the historical history of the figure that many think is still worth venerating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many who, probably more recently in the late 19th century than now, consider Cromwell a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Is such an idea entirely accurate, a subject of historical debate that continues.
There is no question that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures that represents one side of the conflict.
His accomplishments as the Lord Protector should also be commemorated and respected.
The killer pig destroyed a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the name of Yuan was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pigyard in a market in Liupanchui, Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
In Sinin, Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005, a pigyard is about to vaccinate pigs in a pigyard.
It is reported that on Wednesday he and his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan went out to sell 15 pigs in the marketplace.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw that the pigyard’s door was open.
The brother said that the pigyard had a big boar with blood on its mouth.
The medical expert confirmed that the 249-pound boar had decimated the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodguilty and deformed, ” stated a cousin named Wu, quoted by Guiiang Evening News.
The security camera record showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked to prevent her from attacking people.
It is reported that the seven of us, Yuan, and the administration of the market, are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on people have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295 - pound [295 kg] pig had kept a Welsh farmer clamped to a tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer claimed that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can become a triger.
"They're just playful.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with proper respect, ” he said.
Hurricane Rosa’s remains will bring great rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa was predicted to shrink, moving over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
But in the near future, Rosa will bring rains with floods north of Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rosa had a wind speed of 37 miles per hour (this is a hurricane category 1) that was 5 a.m. Eastern on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, there's a torrent that's moving east to the west coast of the United States, and when Rosa approaches the lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it starts to push strong tropical moisture to the north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 inches [25.4 cm] of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, on the nearest days, the tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching valley will produce strong showers in the southwest.
In this area, from 2.54 to 10.2 inches [2.5 cm] of rain will cause dangerous flooding, garbage streams, and desert landslides.
Strong tropical moisture will cause rainfall to increase to between 5 and 7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of the southern region of Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10.2 centimeters of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in the large area of Arizona.
Floods are possible under severe conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We urge you not to walk to the desert, since tropical rains may be possible.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms can bring winds and dust storms.
As the rain approaches, some parts of the north coast of California will rain heavily.
The rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause low waste streams and slippery roads.
It's going to be the first rain shower in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, and on Sunday and Tuesday evening, the rain will become more extensive.
It's going to rain a lot over the For Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperatures throughout the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
At times, this can result in a sharp change in temperature at short distances.
Sunday will be a beautiful example of a dramatic temperature change in the central United States.
This is almost a 7-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and DeMoins, Iowa.
During the next few days, summer heat will try to return and spread.
It is expected that the U.S. will be warm to October in a large area in the center and east, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
Temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long-term forecast, there is a high probability of average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Britta Cavanaugh case
On Thursday, over 20 million people in six television networks watched the thrilling testimony of the Supreme Court candidate Britta Cavanaugh and Christine Blaze Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, supposedly occurring in the 1980s.
The political opposition continued, the channels interrupted the scheduled programs to report the latest news on Friday: an agreement prepared by senator Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week FBI investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Cavanaugh had been drinking and was trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100 percent convinced that this was not the case.
It's very likely that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people were watching this, as reported by the Nielsen research company.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Could not immediately get numbers on other networks that also showed the listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
By comparison, this audience is about the size of an audience that watches a play-off or Oscar prize.
Fox News Channel, whose fans were very supportive of Cavanaugh's assignment, was the leader of all channels during the day's listening, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, at Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNC had 2.89 million, CNN had 2.52 million.
The interview remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the center of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he was going to vote for Cavanaugh, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras were caught shouting at Flake when he tried to take the elevator to the Court Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was yelled, which was broadcast in direct air on CNN.
“ I am standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
It was said to him, "You have authority, but a multitude of women are powerless."
Flake reported that his office had published a statement and, before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more about the committee.
All cable and broad channel channels broadcast directly hours later, when the Court Committee was to vote to advance Cavanaugh’s candidate to the Senate in its entirety.
Flake said he'd only do it if he knew that the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate next week, which required a democratic minority.
Flake was partially persuaded to talk to his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Kuns, and then with several other senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was influenced, because it was obvious that the Republicans would have no votes to appoint Cavanaugh's candidate without an investigation.
President Trump has initiated a FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May blames critics for "political games" around Brexite.
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May attended a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview that followed the interview of Theresa on the front page of the newspaper, the former foreign minister of her government, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Checkers Plan for Brexit, saying that it was “absolutely absurd ” to offer Britain and the EU to draw the customs of each other.

The volcano throws ashes out on Mexico City
Popocatepetl’s ashes have reached southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Warning Center on Saturday urged the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, since the crater had begun to be active and 183 gas and ash emissions had been registered within 24 hours.
The center tracked numerous noises and shocks.
Photos on social networks show thin layers of ash on the frontal glass of automobiles in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Himimilko.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of a volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake with a magnitude of 1.1 in central Mexico in September 1951.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police encountered the Catalan Separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who claimed independence encountered a police unit, thousands joined protesters to celebrate the first anniversary of the Katalonia vote on the division.
A masked proseparatist group, held back by special forces, threw them with eggs and powdered paint that created dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually full of tourists.
Tensions took place and later on that day, the police used sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, groups of independenceists who scanned, "Let's not forget, let's not forgive," encountered those who supported the preservation of the country, who shouted, "Let's live Spain.
According to a local press report, fourteen people were helped to cope with minor injuries suffered during the protests.
A year later, October 1, declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists, tension in the region of independence remains high.
The majority of the voters voted for independence, but the turnout was low, since most of those who opposed the division boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in brutal collisions during the past year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in all the region.
The independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow a different route.
68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electrician who participated in a seperatorial protest with his wife, claimed that he no longer had the hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"We've been through one of our best moments this past year.
I watched my parents weep over the joy that they can vote, but now we're in the corner, ” he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that advocate independence failed to maintain the momentum of this year, because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisonment in anticipation of the court for their participation in the cabinet and further declaration of independence.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a police protest on the phone, claimed that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“ Stress is increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the insulator since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament next year.
“The status of a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and opposition that we see from the Spanish government, ” he said.
The men were arrested after the car entered the house.
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after the car entered a house in Londonderre several times.
The incident took place at Ballingard Crescent on Thursday, 7:30 p.m., in British standard time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noticed that the gate and the house had been damaged.
It is possible that at some point a crossbow was fired on the car.
Menga's hit gave Livingstone victory over Rangers with a score of 1-0
The first goal of Dolly Menga in Livingstone became the winner
High in the Livingstone class, he stunned the Rangers and brought Stephen Gerrard the second of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit was decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to one level in a second from the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team won no victory at the Prime Minister's departure this season and next Sunday will play with the Hards leaders, who are eight points behind it.
On Thursday, the Rangers will receive the Rapod Vienna within the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues its invincible march to six games in the division, and Chief Trainer Holt has not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone is missing out on the odds that give the lame guests.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they killed them, because their straightforwardness creates Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but struck along the gate, then Alan Lithow pierced the gate after he had resisted and accepted the attack of Craig Hulkett along the gate that he had made his head.
The owners were satisfied that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew that they could cause problems for guests with standard positions.
And that's what the crucial goal was.
The Rangers missed a free shot, and Livingstone opened up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson got Menga, who took the ball and killed it from the center of the penalty room.
To this point the Rangers were dominated by the ball, but the protection of the owners of the field turned out to be invincible, and the gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, was generally not disturbed.
This trend continued in the second time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's blow hit Holkeeper Rangers by Allan McGregor, and Lithow hit the gate in another standard combination of Livingstone.
The curtains were constantly coming into Livingstone and were continually neutralized, and two applications were rejected after the Hulkett attack on Glenn Middleton, who went to replace, and behind the hand game.
Livingstone Phenomene: analysis
Alasdair Lamont of "BBC Scotland" at Tony MacAroni Arena
Fenomeenal game and Livingstone's result.
All of them were very good at playing, and they continued to exceed the expectations of this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and composition changed little after returning to the highest level, but you have to give Holt credit for the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett played hugely, very well organized the defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Warral watchful all the time.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerrard’s direction, but now they are far from reaching those standards.
They didn't have the last ball -- just once they broke the defense of the landlords -- and it was kind of a wake for the Rangers, which ended up in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was received in Cologne in a vague way
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there were smiles and blue skys.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's conflicting visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO's allies.
There have been disputes among them on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police refused to let 25,000 people gather in front of the mosque, but many of the president's adherents were still there to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — including many of the Kurds — have also made themselves heard, condemning Erdogan’s politics and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Two - sided protests illustrate the ambiguity of the visitor, whom some Germans called hero and others called dictator.
Depford’s Road Crash: The cyclist was killed in a collision with a car
A bicycle rider died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the Bestwood Street Crossroads and Evelyn Street on a live road in the Deptford area in the southeast of the city about 10:15 a.m. British Standard Time.
The driver stopped, and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
This accident took place a few months after another cyclist died after the driver had escaped from Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the Saturday accident.
The London police claimed that they were working on the man’s installation to inform his closest relatives.
Travel bans and bus routes have been changed, and motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long-Lartin Prison: six prisoners injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured by riots in a men's prison of strict security, informed the prison administration.
Her Majesty's Long-Lartin prison in Worcestershire started at about 9:30 a.m. in British standard time on Sunday, and it's still going on.
To stop the upheaval, the eight incarcerated and localized in one wing, a special unit called "Tornado" was called.
The officers were given medical attention in connection with the traumatic facial injuries they received at the scene.
A representative of the prison service commented: “In order to resolve an incident in the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, a specially trained prison staff was involved.
Six coworkers received medical attention in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and their prison sentences can be extended."
Her Majesty Long-Lartin's prison has more than 500 inmates, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden had been sent to hospital treatment after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, the Special Police Department was summoned to prison to stop the serious riots that attacked the jailers with billiard layers.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with torrential floods.
Tropic depression rarely hits Arizona, but this can happen early in the next week, since the remains of Hurricane Rosa are heading through the southwest of the desert, creating the risk of torrential floods.
The National Weather Service has already published flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday night will be rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
and Katrina in 1967 was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the border of Arizona.
According to recent predictions by the National Center for Hurricanes, the region of Mogallon Rome in Arizona is estimated to be between 5.08 and 10.1 inches, and in places up to 15.4 inches in rainfall.
Other parts of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Bath, are likely to get from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of rainfall, perhaps up to 10.6 cm.
Where there is no risk of torrential flooding, Rose’s rain can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these showers are likely to be useful because the southwest is now experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. drought control center, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, reports Weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to shifts on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, is still in the force of a hurricane at a maximum wind speed of 130 miles per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 19.3 km per hour.
The storm encounters more cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore shrinks.
Thus, the storm is expected to cause a shift in Mexico during the day or Monday evening of a tropical storm.
The rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a high risk of flooding.
“It is expected that the total rainfall from Lower California to Northwest Sunora will range from 7.62 to 15.4 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm, ” reportsweather.com.
Next, Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, get to Arizona's border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue across Arizona and late in the evening on Tuesday to south Utah.
“The main danger that Rose or her remains are expected to face is the very heavy rains in Lower California, northwest Sonouri, and southwest of the American desert, ” reports the National Center for Hurricanes.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life - threatening floods and torrents of waste in the deserts, as well as to mud slides in the mountainous region.
Midsomer-Norton attack: four people arrested who attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of murder after they found a 16-year-old man with knives in Summerset.
An injured teenager was found in the Excelsior-Terras area at Midsomer-Norton about 4:00 p.m. British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, informed the Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking everyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump says that Cavanaugh had been “suffered and angry ” by the Democratic Party
“The voice of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and indignant tactics of the Democratic Party, ” stated Trump at a rally in Willinga, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh had been “suffered and angered ” by the Democratic Party during the entire hanging process.
Cavanaugh gave a witness before Congress on Thursday, violently and emotionally denying Christine Blazey Ford's accusation that he had sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness at the hearing about the charges against her.
On Saturday, the president declared that on that day, “the American people saw Cavanaugh’s brilliantness, character and courage. ”
“The voice of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for one of the most perfect lawyers of our time, a lawyer with excellent public service experience, ” he said to a mob of adherents in West Virginia.
The president spoke favorably of Cavanaugh’s stand when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans ’ being present in mid-term elections.
"In five weeks there will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, ” he said.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the democracy mission was to “oppose and hinder. ”
It is expected that the first key procedure vote in the Senate for Cavanaugh's candidacy will take place no later than Friday, and CNN has told the assistant of one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds of people died of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and death toll is on the rise
At least 384 people were killed, many were washed into the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawes, claiming that the country was in power on the Sabbath.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) hit the beach in the dark, killing many to death and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7,5 points.
“When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach, and they didn’t immediately begin to flee, and they were victims, ” declared the BNPP, a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPP), in Djakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
“It was not just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on land, ” said Nugroho, adding that, before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed the trees and survived, he added.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palou.
Aerial pictures published by the disaster management agency show that many buildings and stores have been destroyed, bridges have been turned and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The tremors in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Rating and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by a major earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have contributed to the tsunami, an agency.
Nugroho called the damage “wide - scale ” and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had been destroyed.
Some victims were found under wreckage of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing without a word.
Nugroho noted that victims and injuries could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Pala in an area called Donghala, which is near the earthquake’s epicenter.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn't get any information from Donghala, ” said Nugroho.
Over 300,000 people live there, according to the Red Cross’s proclamation, and it is added that its personnel and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
“It is a tragedy, but it can become much bigger, ” says the report.
On Saturday, the agency received a wide range of criticism for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Pale, even though official officials said the waves had arrived at the time indicated in the warning.
On the amputees that people shared in social networking, a man on the top of the building shouts wild warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, a wall of water struck the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the actuality of the frames immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a serious shutdown of electricity that cut off the connection around Pale, which made it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
Military officials began to send cargo planes from Djakarta and other cities, informed the authorities, but evacuated people still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city airport was opened for help only, and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centers in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision team members from Donghala have safely reached the city of Palu, where they hide in tarpaulin tents installed in the courtyard of their office, but on the way they saw the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Dosseba.
“They told me that they had seen many destroyed houses, ” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to take decisive action to eliminate the effects of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with great experience would not be allowed to go to Pale.
According to Indonesian rules, financing, supplying and providing personnel from abroad can only begin if disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level, ” observed Auliah Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted."
It was the second night that came down on Pala after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, and friends and families of those who had not yet been found still hoped that the arrival of their loved ones would be a miracle to cover these gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewers.
On Sunday, rescue workers obtained a woman who lay under stone for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Hendon Subandono, a trainer for the Indonesian National Paraplanery Team, trained two missing paraplaners to participate in Asian games that had been held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paralysts trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandaga, were his disciples.
“As an older paraplanet, I have my emotional burden, ” he said.
Mr. Hendon relates that a few hours after the news of the ruining of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to the paralyzing community, he desperately sent messages to the WhatsApp opponents of Pale, who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray mark, not with double blue ticks.
"I think that means that the message has not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 when the ATM was added to the Newport on the Levie
On Friday morning, thieves stole 26,750 dollars from a worker named Brink, who ran an ATM to Newport on the Levee, reports the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy on the news.
While he was busy, another man "running from behind to fellow worker Brink" and snatched a bag of money to fill out.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport police at 8592,522-3680.
Kanier West: The reper changes its name to E
Raper Kanier West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, when he announced a change on Twitter, he wrote: “Previously known as Canier West. ”
41-year-old West was called Y for some time, and he used this shortcut as a name for his album released in June.
The change took place just before he appeared on the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
At the show, he replaces a singer named Arian Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," reported the author of the show.
It is not just a shortening of the present professional name, but it was previously spoken of by West as having a religious meaning for him.
"I believe that 'e' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," told West earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with Big Boy. —
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The canyé, which means "one," was shortened to just "E" -- it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Canier is one of a few famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deady, P. Grandpa and Grandpa, announced this year that he had chosen Love and Breaser Love.
West's former colleague, JAZ, also experimented with defiance and big letters.
President Andrés Manuel López Abrador of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Abrador, has promised never to use an army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloodguilt of the students.
On Saturday, López Abrador promised to “never use an army to suppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, the military fired on a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people, while the left student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
López Abrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and by opening more free public universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead youths to criminal groups.
U.S. funding in artificial intelligence needs to be doubled
Since China is increasing activity in artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount they spend on research in this field, and the investor and practice in the ClI Kai-Foo Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These comments were given after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the MI, although there is no formal strategy in the U.S. for the Wl.
By the way, China presented its plan last year: it wants to become #1 in the innovation of the Sl until 1930.
“The double budget for the SEI study would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in the Sl, ” said Lee.
Double funding can double the probability that the next big breakthrough in the U.S. is going to be in the U.S., said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Shi Substates: China, Silicon Valley and a New World Order" was published this month by Hoghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of the Synovation Ventures Foundation, who invested in Face++, one of the most famous MI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mallon University, he was working on the Sl System, which played the best American player in Othello, and later executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee observed earlier competitions with technology conducted by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge of Advanced Defense Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when the next ones would be to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, says Lee.
“It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations, ” he remarked.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring lights from universities in recent years to work on Sl.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. to increase efforts in the field of MI.
"I think that Green Card should be offered automatically to the S.I.S. candidates," he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the development of the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 1951.
The National Fund for Natural Science in China provides funding for people who work in academic institutions, just as the National Science Fund and other U.S. government agencies are giving money to American researchers, and the quality of academic work in China is below, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense had set up a joint centre for artificial intelligence, which was designed to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House had announced the formation of a Special Committee for artificial intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
In the case of the National Science Fund, it now invests over $100 million a year in a study of Shea.
In the meantime, the U.S. law - enforcement agency, who wanted to establish a Commission for National Security of Artificial Intellect, did not take any action within a few months.
The Macedonians vote at the conference to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday at the summit on whether to change the name of the country to the Northern Macedonia Republic, which would allow for the resolution of a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia’s possibility of membership in Europe and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has imposed a ban on Macedonia's entry to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments concluded a treaty on the basis of a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the treaty claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote at the protest, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the minimal 50% of the vote would be reached, which would allow it to be considered valid.
The question in the Declaration Letter is, “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU under the terms of a treaty with Greece? ”
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, say that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that it could live freely under the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us, ” said 79-year-old Oliver Georgiewski in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote does not involve legal obligations, enough members of Parliament have said that they will support it to make it decisive.
To change the name would require two thirds of the vote in Parliament.
The national election committee stated that by 1 p.m. there were no reports of violations.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their newsletters into the urns.
"I've come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," declared 62-year-old elector Giose Tanevski in the capital of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Straumice, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zayev of Macedonia, his wife Zoreka and his son Soulko gave their vote at the conference to change the name of the country, which would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
Before the Congress in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodymire Cawardakov prepared a small scene and put chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the protesters.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the service door, ” declared Kavardakow.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev believes that membership in NATO will bring a lot of needed investment in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority vote in favor, since more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO, ” said Zayev after the vote.
He pointed out that the “yes ” outcome would confirm their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters will be involved in the election, which is below the required appearance.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonia’s Telma television channel, 57 percent of the respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote for it.
In order to be declared valid, it has to be equal to 50% plus 1 vote.
The defeat at the protest will be the first major blow to the politics of the Western government since its beginning last May.
Look: Cergio Aguero of Manchester City goes all the way to Briton's defense and hits a goal.
Sirchio Aguero and Rahim Sterling fought for Briton and brought the Manchester City victory with a score of 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Hall Aguero, at the 65th minute of the match, looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker was given a pass at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three of Briton's supporters and found himself in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went around one defender, and then he ran a few more on the edge of Briton's penalty.
Then he went to the left when he saw Sterling.
An English forward made the first touch on the penalty counter to give the Aguero ball, which, with its right boot, launched it on the right side of the gate, defeating the Briton holkeper, Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs," said the reporter's manager, Pep Gardilla.
We agreed that he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at this moment."
But the prime advantage of the sky-blue in this match was that of Sterling.
That goal took place at 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep in Briton's territory.
He sent a beautiful piercing pass along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few touches, and he continued to pass Sterling in the direction of the long trouser.
Forward of the celestial blues threw the ball into the gate just before he slipped outside.
City will meet Hoffhenheim at the group stage of the League of Champions at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Reine Neckkar Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take the points to Roxis
Since the Washington Nussals team left the playoff, there was no reason to wait for another start.
But rival Sherzer hopes to go to the Pitcher Mountain on Sunday in a match against Colorado Rockies, provided that Roxies still has difficulty getting to playoff, and now Roxies is one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West League.
Roxies at least have a Wild Card for winning 5-2 on Nassionals on Friday night, but they still want to secure the title of the first division.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to leave the ball, knowing how the viewers are doing here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level that I've seen this year.
Why don't I want to take part in this competition?
The Nashionals will still announce who will be the starter on Sunday, but they are said to be leaning toward Sherzer.
Sherzer, for whom this is going to be the 34th start, has a pitching session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
The Washington right has a score of 18-7 out of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 inning this season.
Trump meetings in West Virginia
The president spoke favorably of the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Britta Cavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the presence of Republican supporters in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we have done will be on the map in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will be held.
It's one of the big, big -- I don't run, but I'm really running, so I fight for great candidates wherever I can, ” he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it's happening now.
And they're firmly set up to regain power, using any means, you see vileness, shit.
They don't care who's suffering from them, who's going to step over to gain power and control, they want power and control, we don't want to give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is “to resist and hinder. ”
“And you've seen it for the last four days, ” he said, calling the Democrats “wicked and mean, disgusting and lying. ”
He mentioned the Senate Court Committee, calling the democratic senator Diane Feynstein by name, who provoked the audience to hear loud rumors of discontent.
"Remember her answer?
Did you get the ID?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- this was really a bad language of the body-mobile -- the worst language of the body-mobile that I've ever seen."
The Laborist Party is no longer a broad church.
It is untolerant to those who express their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was hardly unexpected.
Finally, I'm the last of those Laborists in Parliament to be told that they're not happy, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated almost the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semiticism.
I was convicted of dissenting Jeremy Corbin.
As to the importance of responsible economic policies, about national security, about Europe, these questions are ironically similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with earlier leaders.
A report on the Nottingham East meeting on Friday says, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the laborers were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of “more benevolent, softer ” politics has long been forgotten if it has ever been carried out.
It becomes increasingly obvious that the Laborist Party does not allow different views, and every thought is appreciated from the position of being acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, a group with which I thought I had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept positions that I would never agree with, whether national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public — and no matter what I say — this is followed by a series of attacks on social networks with calls for withdrawal, condemnation of central politics, and I'm told that I shouldn't be in the Laborist Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I've received are usually political.
I am thrilled at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily encounter sexual or racist attacks, but never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse levels have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Laborist Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a large church, and with every movement of distrust or change in the rules of selection, the party narrows down.
For the last two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been urged not to stand up, not to speak so loudly that I'm "all right."
But that's not why I came to politics.
I joined the Laborists 32 years ago as a schoolteacher, because the lack of attention from the Tetcher government literally caused my high school class to collapse, and since then I've been trying to improve the quality of public service for those who need it most, whether it's a local adviser or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was puzzled by my political views and differences with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday's events, I just want to say one thing: in conditions where the country is going to go to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and government agencies, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laiberist Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Notingham Times, but for my voters, both members of the Laiborist Party, and not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of recalling me or any political advantage will prevent me from acting in harmony with what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Air rises
Two recent attempts may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserves a triumph in today's beautiful entertainment match by the Prime Minister of Scotland.
Now they're taking the lead on the table, this is the only invincible team of ten.
After all, the wonderful defense and improved ability to take advantage of the odds gives the hosts and coach Peter Merci the full right to be content.
"We've been through our games so far, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose commented, "I give due "Eir," and they took better chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, carried out by Frazier Climo, led Air forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, published by Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Climo reinforced the leadership of Air with a penny, and right before the break, he made and carried out a solo attempt that he scored 17-5 in favor of Air.
But Melrose had a good start at the second time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Buggot reduced the break to five points.
Then there was a prolonged delay because of the serious trauma of Ruard Knott, who was pulled out of the field on the load, and from the restart of Air, they ran forward with a attempt by Stafford McDauwell, which was carried out by Clemo.
Captain Claire McPherson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt under intense pressure.
The owners came back, but when Strayan Hutchinson got a yellow card for Climo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the mole "Air."
Climo tried what he did almost every time after reset, and then Kyle Rowe got from David Armstrong hit in the box and sent a flunker to Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the host team.
Seems like a still Game star set up for a new career in the restaurant realm.
It seems that the Star of the "After Game" series, Ford Kieran, is set up for a new career in hospitality, which can be concluded after it is known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC television series that he's writing to and in which he's shooting with Greg Hamfield's old comedy partner.
Duet announced that the future ninth episode would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning his life after Cragling.
According to the official record, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter the "blossomy restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The Sea of Ours": internal Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a well-equipped Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang an ocean-blue flag.
The sea base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is painted with a motto: “The sea is ours.
We must return it."
In Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, there's still a memory of the loss of the coastline, which went back to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century with natural resources, and there's a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is looking forward to an international trial on October 1, after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and tranquillity and, of course, a positive outcome, ” commented Roberto Calsadius, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the decision of the government on large screens across the country, and they hope that the court in Gaaz will take a decision in favor of Bolivia, and after decades of shattering conversation, Chile will be forced to negotiate for Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic root president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his reconversion the following year, also puts great hope in a decision that will be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in Bolivia’s favor, and if that happens, little will change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to condemn the territory of Chile and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The decision of the NJ, made only six months after the final arguments were presented, indicates that the case “was not complicated, ” was told by Pas Zarate, a Chilen expert on international law.
Bolivia’s case has not progressed, and for the past four years it may have contributed to the reversal.
“The request for access to the sea has been used by the present Bolivian administration, ” Zaraté said.
The war rhetoric of Morales blew up the remains of Chile’s kindness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not been able to exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodriguez Valtze, a representative of Bolivia in Haiti, did not agree that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will get “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of Chile’s relationship and a chance to end 139 years of differences by mutual benefit, ” he said.
Calsadius also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the issue of the sea as a political cradle.
“Bolivia will never give up her right of access to the Pacific, ” he added.
This resolve is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says there's no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons before it can trust Washington.
Ree spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made at the Singapore summit by the leaders of the superpowers.
His comments came up when U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which went into the deaf corner more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chang Inn.
Ree says that belief that the continuation of the Sanctions and the United States’ declaration of the end of the Korean War will one day put North Korea on the knees is a “incessant dream. ”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Phenyang takes significant steps toward disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously abandoning his arsenal, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive headdresses on the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a series of eccentric headdresses in the style of the Orbitase of the spring-seven 2019 on the episodes of the brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers have already sent their insatiable creatures beyond the range of the event.
Valentino stood out as an extravagant bee hat with a wide-painted feathered field that covered the heads of the models.
Among the others, the overs are adorned with precious stones of coffee, the hat of the sorcerer, and even the hat-sanas, but they're not to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks — very early before Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than high - fashioned.
One was like an underwater swim with a tube and glasses; another looked like a crack of ice cream that melted.
And if you support this serious fashionable application, you're lucky.
Stylists say huge hats can come out on the main streets of your city.
The Overcast Capillaries became fashionable because of the La Bomby, a straw hat with fields that were 60 centimeters wide, which was seen on all, from Rianna to Emily Ratazhkowski.
A cult brand behind a very impractical hat, which was seen everywhere in social networks, gave peace another creation: a straw bag the size of a beach, almost like a model in a bathing suit that carried it.
A bag of yellow-red raffa with a raffa and a white leather pen was the center of a collection of La Riviera spring-year-long 2019 brands of Jacquemus in the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “In the coming summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the designer’s influence is so enormous that it will be difficult to ignore demand for an overlay. ”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is binding to citizens of the world.
Independent schools in Scotland support high standards of learning, and in 2018 they again received excellent results from exams that complement individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which teach more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, and they want to provide the best services for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to train students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable for choice in schools.
Nelson Nelson said: “If you talk to a language that she understands, she understands it with her mind.
If you speak to her in her native language, she feels it in her heart. ”
It's a powerful reminder that we can't use English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year's exams, we see that in independent schools, languages are spoken in the ratings of subjects with the best grades.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages got a higher A.
Data collected in 74 schools in the SHR revealed that 72 percent of students got a higher A in Chinese, and 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish also got A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills that children and youth will no doubt need in the future.
Now, language as an object of choice is taught in the same way as NTIMs (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), in independent school programs, and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Jobs and Skills Commission in 2014, revealed that 17% of the reasons why employers cannot close jobs are due to a lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for a future career.
Because more and more promising positions are in need of knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalizing world.
No matter what career you choose, if someone has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages the advantage over competitors.
According to a 2013 YouTube survey of over 4,000 adults in Britain, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double - sized percentage of people (15%).
That's why investing in language teaching is important to today's children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially in the developing world, will provide more opportunities for children to find a full - time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn its own languages.
A series of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to Britain from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, it is always possible to select several languages in independent schools to study them with qualified teachers.
Scotland’s independent schools try to create an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for them.
Now, we can't deny that in the international business environment, languages continue to have vital meaning for the future country, so it should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be viewed as “the skills of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety, and perfection to Scottish youths.
Il faut byen le fire.

LeBron is debuting with Lakers in San Diego.
Fans who want to see the first start of Labron James for Los Angeles Lakers are almost there.
Master Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday on the first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll be playing, it's not decided yet.
“It's going to be more than one and less than 48, ” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reported that James would most likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
“In this phase of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare, ” he replied.
Trump meetings in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is opening a series of election rallies from the city of Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trump rallys planned for the next week, including those in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidate he offered to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump wants to form support for future mid-term elections, because the Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s evening meeting in West Virginia take place today, and how can we view it on the Internet?
Trump's meeting in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19 o'clock in the East today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below in live air on YouTube.
Trump will probably mention the tension of the hearing this week over a candidate in the Supreme Court, Britta Cavanaugh, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the delay in the Senate vote for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans gain popularity before the election in November.
President Trump's representatives stated that these five elections the following week were aimed at “activation of volunteers and supporters, because the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand most of the votes they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, ” reports Reuters.
“Congress control is so critical to its day order that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the tense period of the pre-election campaign is approaching, ” said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign, who did not want to name his name.
At the Wesbanko Arena Stadium in Willing, today’s rally is open to supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday’s visit will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the last month, where he won over 40 percent of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate from the Republicans to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisy, whose ratings are down in the polls.
“ This is not good for Morris, who is coming to raise his polls, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and hoped for Sunday singles
After three sessions that ended with a one - sided victory, Saturday forces can be exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
The swing pendulum of the impulse is a completely fictional sports concept that players really believe in, especially at similar events.
So when do they say the pulse works?
"They were six points ahead, and now they're four, so I think we're taking it a little bit like a pulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, says Spit, feel a little wind in their windmills, and they're also encouraged by a lot, not the last time, by the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who were playing together all day long, and each of them made three points out of four.
Spit and his killer blows from the top to the bottom show an example.
These larynx cries of the celebration became louder when, in the course of his round, he made a decisive patch and leveled the score at the fourth match after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His path, which allowed them to win a match on 15 holes, met with a similar cry, such as telling you that the American team doesn't appear.
"You really just have to try hard and worry about your own match," said Spit.
That's all each of these players left now.
18 holes to be known.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable story of the Ryder Cup.
Unusual, but a charming couple in Europe have four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
Molivud was the only couple who didn't make the godga on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to avoid the godga on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This race and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this turbulent crowd makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Fleetwood or Molinari to secure the potential victory of the Europeans when the sun sets over Le Gulf National.
Both are desirable at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the triumph of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson took care of Sergio Hansia, the hero of morning troupes when he was in a relationship with Alex Norren.
One bohga and two dabs on the first nine holes led the Spaniard and the Swede to a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to observe foreballs and nozzles because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the interesting thing about how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe is now playing better than a team and has a lot of advantage on the last day, but this session of the nozzles also showed that the U.S. team is going to fight, which some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe is leading with a score of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
On the closing day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a sterling advantage, for after the Saturday forbes and fores, it precedes the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired duet by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the late Tiger Woods, and now at Le Gulf National they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to recover the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning forts with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. had greater resistance in the fores and won two matches but could not reduce the breakup.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, but he and Mollinari are the first four points in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Breaking up Woods and Patrick Reed in fortballs, they united to defeat the swollen Woods and the American novelty Bryson Deshambo with an even more spectacular 5th4.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, showed random breakthroughs of genius, but at the moment he lost 19 of his 29 matches in forbes and fores and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in morning forts, returned to Henry Stanson's forearm partner to get a 2-to-1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooklyn Koopka, which is the first and third in the world's rating.
Europe couldn't do everything in its own way this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
The three main winners, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two points.
They won a decisive victory over the Spaniards, John Ram and Ian Polter, and later they defeated Polter and Rory McLray with a score of 4th3 in the fores, losing the first two holes.
Just twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team returned with a four-point deficit in the singles, although Furik's team only needed nothing to save the trophy.
However, after two days of second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it can't.
North Korea says that “never ” will not be dismantled in a one-sided manner without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of the penalties deepened the mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual United Nations General Assembly that last year North Korea had taken “unique measures of goodwill, ” such as the end of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantlement of the nuclear testing site, and the obligation not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Well, we don't see the right response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will by no means be the first to disengage in a one-way manner. ”
And while Ree repeated North Korea’s familiar complaints about the “step ” approach to deuclarization against Washington, where North Korea would be rewarded for its progressive steps, his claim was important because it did not reject the one-sided declaration that Phnyang had done in the past.
Ree referred to Kima Cheng In and Donald Trump's joint statement at the first in history between the real U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for “deuclarization of the Korean Peninsula ” and Trump promised a security guarantee to North Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to weaken the harsh international response to North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on "declaration at first" and raises the level of pressure by means of the discipline to achieve its goal violently, even denying "the end of war," said Ree.
“It is an impossible dream for those who don’t know us to think that the punishments can put us on our knees.
But the problem is that the extension of the discipline deepens our mistrust.
Ree did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader emphasized at the UN early in the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kima and South Korean leader Moon Jae-yong in the last five months and added: “If South Korea, not the United States, would not have taken the deuclarization of the Korean peninsula to such a deuclarized angle. ”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from that of telling the General Assembly that the North Korean missile attack on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kima a “raket Man ” who wanted to commit suicide.
This year at UN Trump, who threatened to “bring to ruin ” North Korea last year, praised Kima for his courage in taking action on disarmament, but said that much more would have to be done and that the punishments had to remain in force until the deunucularization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump observed that he did not set time limits for this: "It will take two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its steps.
However, U.S. secretary Mike Pompeo stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council authorizations must continue energetically and unflinchingly until we see a complete, final, confirmed deuclarization. ”
The Security Council has unanimously increased its measures against North Korea since 2006 in order to block the financing of nuclear programs and ballistic missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Rei in the United Nations General Assembly and then said that the next month he visited Phenyang again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for “gangster demands. ”
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States were to take “supervisive measures. ”
He told us that Kima said that he needed the "corresponding measures" to guarantee the security that Trump had promised in Singapore and the steps he had taken to normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year gave all of his students more sleep, and it's an attempt to fight the growing culture of the steepness of learning all night after the caffeine gas.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigam Women’s Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first in the United States.
He decided to begin the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on his studies.
Finally, one girl approached him and said, "Why are they telling me this now, in the last year?"
“She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, ” said a teacher from The Telegraph.
In the course that was first introduced in this year, students are taught the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results as well as to improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the University, explained that the university decided to introduce the course after it had been discovered that the students were seriously sleepless for a week.
Clock Course includes a series of interactive to-dos.
One chapter has an image of a dorm room where students click cups of coffee, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deficit on sports, and the importance of sleeping routine.
Another chapter shows how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of a campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students instantly.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Cheasler.
A culture of pride for “sleeping all night ” still exists, he added, and noted that modern technology and growing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is increasing.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be a student’s “secret weapon ” to fight stress, burnout and anxiety, even a set of excess weights, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of famine, which causes permanent physical hunger, he explained.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaysler develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all aspirants to take a similar training program before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chessler recommends that students be reminded to go to bed and to set the alarm clock and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light that are emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and that can disrupt the circadic rhythm, which causes problems with sleeping.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset Gerrard's boys
The Rangers survived the queue of the invasion of sadness: Dolly Menga shot a distinct team of Stephen Gerrard with a score of 1-0 from Livingstone.
The ibrox team wanted to win their first victory in the race after the February triumph over St. Johnston with a score of 4-1, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard the second as manager of 18 games, and Gerrard's team stayed eight points behind the Scottish Prime Minister's Hurts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, which lacked inspiration, did not seem to be able to equalize the score.
Now the Rangers are down to the sixth position, and Livingstone is up to the third position, and by the difference between the balls, they're only ahead of the Hibbernian.
The Rangers may also have another problem, since the lineman Kalum Spence has had to process the head wound after he has been thrown into the guest sector by some object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that had once passed the Air in the halffinal Scots League Cup.
And Holt released the same Levy 11 warehouse that took one point to the Harts last week, and he was thrilled by the way his furious boys put the opponents down at every point.
The Rangers may have dominated the game, but Livingstone worked more with the ball they got.
They were to kill in just two minutes of the game, when Menga's first pass into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit Allan McGregor's gates, but the Half Protector squandered this great chance by sending the ball outside the gate.
Keagan Jacobs's free-throwing shot got to Skipper Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithow, hit his back pants.
The Rangers actually got control, but the last third had more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should be entitled to a pension for a quarter of an hour after the collision with Stephen Lawless, but Stephen Thomson's report rejected the Columbian appeal.
The Rangers were able to hit only two of the gates at the first time, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, hit the head of Lassana Kulibali and the calm blow of Ovié Ejariah did little to disturb.
And even though the 34-minute overpass of Livingstone may have contradicted the pace of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only by their hard work.
The Rangers were unable to handle Jacobs' cooking again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Menga for a simple ending.
In the break, Gerrard replaced the Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the hurling went to Morelos, but the astonishing Kelly hurried off his line to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to force guests to play the same game they liked when Lithow and Hulkett took one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved the outcome in the last stages, but McGregor was pretty good with Jacobs before Lithow hit the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, made another late application for a fine when he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger’s Counter
And now our Sunday morning almanac page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the time is coming... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since that time, Lyric Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example, in 1950's "Dial Coronado" film with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play questionable cowboy-scientific.
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the effect on the radioactive atoms in minerals."
Evans: "Well, it's really cracking right now.
Gans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method is to remove immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory.
And then these cells are able to see proteins that are common to many types of cancer, and then these cells are injecting the patient again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for over 18 months.
The method includes removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can “see ” common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and continuing to reintroduce these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Maryland, observed: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine. ”
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells from patients and “teaching ” them to target cancer cells, has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
After a show of SNLs appeared in the studio at the MAGA Baseball, Kanier West dulled with a sharp talk to support President Trump,
what caused the viewers to react negatively
Spectators at the SNL (Sudden Evening in Direct Epira) studio learned Kanier after his sad performance, in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and claimed to be running for President in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Tower, in a baseball cap labeled "Return America's Former Glory," he exploded with a tirade in which he criticized the Democrats, and again claimed his support for Trump.
"Sometimes, white people ask me, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd be leaving America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began with Matt Damon's sketch, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Britta Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Juridical Committee on sexual violence.
Although West’s speech was not broadcast in direct air, the video with his tirade appeared on social networks by Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting this post.
West also complained to the viewers that he had a bad situation behind the barbecue because of the headdress.
According to the Washington Examiner, West said, "When I was out there, I was treated harshly.
I was told, "Don't go to the viewers in this baseball game."
They bullied me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
West continued, "Do you want to see the place where the oppressed are silent, and I'm going to wear my superman baseball, because nobody can tell me what to do, and you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to a newsmagazine named Variety, his comments at least twice provoked a negative reaction of the audience in the hall, and the actors in the SNL show looked confused, and one of the viewers said, "The studio was dominated by dead silence."
Westa was invited at the last minute to replace a singer named Arian Grande, whose former boyfriend, Raper McMiller, died a few days before the air.
West surprised many by performing the song I Love it (I love it) in the suit of a water bottle Perrier.
Westa was supported by the head of a conservative organization called TPUSA Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the most ridiculous:
Instead, the conductor of Karen Gunther's talk show wrote on Twitter that West "is who he is, and that's just great."
"I don't want to reward him (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art) who I think is practicing and exposing the ideology that hurts my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: he was now "the one who was once known as the West Canyon."
West is not the first artist to change his name, but he's following the example of Grandpa, also known as Puff Deady, Puffy, and Pip Grandpa.
Snoop Dog's Collegiate was formerly called Snoop Lyon, and as we know, the musical legend of the last decades of Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then he became "The Artist Who used to be Prince."
Charged of attempted murder after a knife attack at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The prosecutor will look into the charges.
Star of The Gray of the Thrones, Keith Gerington, condemns the idealization of brutality.
Keith Heerington became famous for the role of a warrior with the sword of Jon Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series "The Grave of thrones" produced by HBO.
However, a 31-year-old actor who denounces the hero-macho stereotype, arguing that because of such heroes, young boys often feel that they have to become cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said that he thought something had gone wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the era of popular hashtag #MeTo (#natural, #entertainment, etc.).
Cate, who recently married his coworker in Grey thrones, a 31-year-old actress named Rose Lesley, noted that he was quite determined to fight this problem.
"I'm now pretty determined when we're on a slippery path to idealizing brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up because of the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for the popularization of brutality through images of extremely courageous heroes.
He continued, "What is natural, and what are we planted?
Why do TV and the street teach that young boys feel pressured to be such men?
I think today's really important question is, "How can we change this?"
Because it's obvious that the young guys are off the right track."
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any of the grapes and sicwells of "The Hearts of the thrones" after he finished the show the next summer, because "he's done with the battles and the horses."
As of November, Keith will play the "Real West" play by Sam Shepard -- the story of the movie producer and his brother- robber.
As an actor recently admitted, he thinks that meeting his wife Rose is the best he's ever received from a series called Game of thrones.
"When I was filming in this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life," said Keith.
In a fantasy series that won the Emmy prize, Rose played Game -- the love of Herington's hero John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018, and the ceremony took place in Lesley's family estate in Scotland.
HlV/AlDS: China reported a sharp increase of 14% in new cases
In China, a 14 - percent increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS was reported.
According to health authorities, there are more than 820,000 patients in the country as a whole.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted by sex, indicating a change in the previous trend.
For a long time, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions in some parts of China.
However, according to official health authorities at a conference held in the province of Yunnan, the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The sexual transmission of HlV at times is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminating of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT society often suffers from discrimination.
According to studies, between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men continue to marry women because of the prevailing conservative values in the country.
The transmission of the disease in most cases results from improper use of sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HlV drugs, seeing it as a partial solution.
Maxine Waters denies the shedding of the data of the Republican senators into the network by her regular employee and criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denounced claims that one of her regular employees had placed the personal data of three U.S. press senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The democracy in Los Angeles claims that these statements promote ultraright political viewers and websites.
"Little, lying, and then even more hideous lies," said Waters on Twitter.
According to reports, the published information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Linda Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Getch of Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday, and they were placed by an unknown person from the Capitol in a hearing before a Senate committee against Britta Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of judge of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Data leaked some time after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
The Hill reported that on conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the IP address of the source was connected to the Waters office and was able to locate data from its regular collaborator.
"These baseless claims are absolutely untrue, they don't match reality," said Waters.
"The coworker of my office, whose personal data and security are threatened by these phony and lying statements, has nothing to do with the flow of this information.
These groundless statements are absolutely false, they are not true."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the web, and one of the others was former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleiser.
"This denial is filled with anger," wrote Flaiser.
"It suggests that with that kind of character she cannot be a member of Congress.
If a person is accused of what he did not do, he does not need to become angry.
The accused should not be presumptuous.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He needs to remain calm and undisturbed."
It seems that Fleisher was conducting parallels between Waters' reaction and the criticism of the Democrats at the address of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
As a candidate from the Republican Party who is trying to take up Waters' seat after the results of the mid-term elections, he also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"That's the news, if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters noted that her office had already informed "the responsible state and law enforcement authorities of these false claims."
"We're going to do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they're answering the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of Johnnie Inglish's Agent: The New Mission, a pass-by spies with Rowen Atkinson.
It's already a good tradition to look in every new British film for the ideas that Brexit has, and there's a new part of a series of comedy jokes about Johnny Inglish, and the first film, "Johnny Inglish," came out in 2003, and later it was reinstated in 2011, canceling "Johnny Inglish: Restart."
Will it be a ridiculously ironic self-satisfaction to what we are, a new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny Ingleish, with his moving face and his glutted eyes, was once again able to make a mess, and his name more than anything else indicates that this comedian character was designed for viewers in non-Galmian countries.
As you know, Johnny's a wildly funny secret agent, in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, is a little bit from inspector Clouseau, a little bit from Mr. Bean, and a lot of things from the guy who played a single note of the film "Fire chariots" at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The character is also foreshadowed by an international traveler and puzzle that has always left behind a mess that Atkinson played in a long-forgotten television ad by Barclaycard.
The last movie about Johnny Ingleish has some good points.
I liked the scene when Johnny Ingleish, in his knightly armor, was approaching the helicopter, and the spades of the screws were on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for buffalo, but humor is passable, and in some respects it's too much, especially when compared to serious movies like Agent 007 and "Mission Impossible," one of the "ingredients" of which is also a comedy.
It seems that jokes are more designed for children than for adults, and I do not seem as ingenious and thoughtful as the Atkinson images of Bean.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
The British super secret spy network is infiltrated by a hacker and uncovers the names of all field agents, which has become a complete surprise to an active agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episode in the movie).
It turned out to be the last part of the prime minister -- a haughty person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity. ( Emma Thompson tried to convey the image she had been exposed to by Teresa May, but the script did not fully reveal it.)
The intelligence counselors informed her that all active agents had been compromised, and she needed to involve one of the retired.
Choice falls on the awkward Johnny Inglisha, who now works as a teacher in some super-tech school and has informally taught children to work under cover (in this part with the spy year's school), the Inglisha was a couple of good jokes for teenagers.
Inglisha is quickly shipped to Whitehol for emergency buffing, where he reunites with his distressing friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine.
So when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty goes sober, Batman and Robin are back in action and suddenly meet the deadly woman Ophelia Piedov, who is played by Olga Curilenko.
And at this time, the prime minister comes under the magic of a charismatic billionaire who made his wealth in technology and technology and claims he can fix the problem with the British network, the evil Jason Volt played by Jake Lacey.
Inglis and Baf go on a journey and again resort to their ridiculous stings: they fire in a fancy French restaurant dressed by waiters; they then sow chaos by illegally going abroad on Volta’s luxury boat; Inglis puts a real mess when he tries to use the helmet of virtual reality to learn how to plan Volta’s house.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but by his goodness and fury he resembles a movie for children.
A passing film.
Like watching other movies about Johnny Inglisha, I asked myself the same question: Can't the British movie industry offer Rowena Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Laborists deny the preparation of a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they'll be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Laborist Party is going to discuss a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but they're going to be paid in five days.
It's reported that the party wants to make it necessary for the executives of the companies to transfer the money saved by the revolution of artificial intelligence to the workers, giving them an extra weekend.
Thus, the workers will have a three - day weekend and bring home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea will fit the party's economic program and direct the country's resources to support the work class.
The move to a four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of the Third Union, and it is hoped that this will enable workers to benefit from changing the economic situation.
The source of the Laborist Party reported to The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week fits the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interest of the workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Laborists were not the first to endorse this idea, because the Green Party promised to set up a four-day working week during the pre-election campaign in 1951.
However, not all members of the Laborist Party currently approve of such a desire.
The Speaker of the Laborist Party stated, "The political program of the Party does not include the introduction of a four-day working week, so we're not currently considering this idea."
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the pre-election meeting of the Laborist Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell claimed that he was set up to take back power from the "faceless directors" of the communal businesses and the "trepreneurs."
The chancellor's plan also means that water companies' sharers may not get all of their equity if the labor government implements "counting" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed the intention to include workers in company management and to create an inclusive share fund to pass 10% of the normal shares of private sector firms to workers whose annual dividends are expected to be up to 500 pounds [500 pounds].
Linda Graham and John Kennedy tell on the 60 Minutes show, or can the FBI investigation of Cavanaugh change their opinion
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Britta Cavanaugh, who leads the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a Supreme Court judge has been postponed for at least a week, and the question arises whether the republican senators will continue to support Cavanaugh after the results of the investigation by the Bureau have been published.
On Sunday 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the audiences John Kennedy and Linda Graham if the FBI could find something to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you really do it?"
He was determined, steadfast, uncompromising."
It seems that Graham’s thinking will no longer change.
"I think the charges against Cavanaugh are provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this:
And everyone she calls can't confirm that under oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't know what can change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what can it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will receive the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the music world with a staggering number of star artists and a equally dramatic mission to fight global poverty.
At the seventh festival of the Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be mobing in the Grand Galley of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to draw attention to the true purpose of the festival – the organizers want to overcome the extreme form of poverty by the year 1930.
The Global City Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors have to do a bunch of tasks or "acts" like taking a tutor in a volunteer project, writing an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or whatever else to help draw attention to the goal of the organization -- the eradication of poverty.
So are there any results, since the organizers of the Global Citizen are 12 years away?
Is the idea of rewarding the act with a free concert a genius way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of what's called "clickivism" when people feel that something is really being changed by signing an electronic petition or by doing a Twitter publication?
According to the Global Citizen, since 2011, they have detected 19 million "works" of their adherents to achieve different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to declare planned financial adjustments and programs worth more than $37 billion, which will help to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by the year 1930.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 financial obligations and public statements as an example, at least 10 billion have been collected and spent.
The group estimates that some 649 million people worldwide have been directly affected.
Among the major financial obligations are the Power of Nutrition Foundation, which has a territorial impact on Britain, and in the framework of the project, investors and developers have committed themselves to helping children grow up, and have promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help cope with malnutrition after they have received more than 4,600 Twitter messages from the Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of Britain, the mecenants, the governments of other countries and the citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history," said the representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman, speaking to the public at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 “acts ” that called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the U.K. government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project to improve the feeding of 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?"
The representatives of the Global Citizen wrote, "This is a long and difficult way, so sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the civil rights movement and against apartheid to us, we're going to succeed because together we're stronger."
Janet Jackson, band The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Giannell Mona, is just part of the star performers this year at the New York festival and will weigh Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The Minister of Internal Affairs stated that the U.S. could use naval forces to block the export of Russian energy.
According to the U.S. Minister of Internal Affairs Ryan Zenke, quoted in Washington Examiner, Washington can seek the help of the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including those in the Middle East.
Zenke stated that Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it is acting on an invitation to a legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy sources.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to mediate in the energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"The U.S. Navy can provide free passage through sea routes and, if necessary, block them to prevent Russian energy from entering the market," he said.
Zenke addressed the parties to the event, which was conducted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that holds itself as the "voice of each consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare the approach to trade with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they were actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy effectively and replace it with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "one-sided," because its economy depends on energy sources of mineral origin.
While these claims were heard, Trump's administration set a goal of increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by evading the energy market from Russian origin, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To that end, officials of Trump's administration and President Donald Trump themselves are trying to persuade the German government to abandon the "unfulfilled" project of building the North Stream 2 which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that the North Stream 2 gas station, which costs 11 billion dollars and which will double the capacity of existing gas monoxide to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of dishonest competition.
"In my view, we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that the consumer should be able to select suppliers," stated Russian energy minister Alexander Nowake after meeting U.S. energy minister Rick Perry, which took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked a negative reaction by Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization of the Federal Union of the German Industry (BDI) has urged the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the two-way agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Union of German Industry, after the last German chancellor, Angela Merchel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren's going to think seriously about going for president in 2020.
The senator from Massachusetts states Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that he would think seriously about running for president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting with the public in Goliac, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of presenting herself.
As The Hill Warren reported, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up the government, and for that to happen, there must be a woman at his head."
"After November 6, I'm going to think seriously about making my candidacy for president."
At a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her appreciation for Donald Trump's presidentship, saying that he's going to go in the wrong direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was open - minded, criticizing Trump and his candidate for the position of Justice of the Supreme Court, Britta Cavanaugh.
In Friday's Twitter, Warren wrote, "No doubt the FBI has to investigate before the vote."
However, according to a poll published on Friday, most of Warren’s voters do not believe that it should run in 2020.
In line with a survey conducted by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University and the publication The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts expressed their opposition to the senator's proposal.
Thirty - two percent supported the promotion.
The survey showed that more support was being received by former Governor Dewal Patrick, and 38 percent was expressed for his potential promotion to the office of President, against 48%.
When discussing the candidates for other prominent democratics who can run in 2020, they also call the former vice president Joe Byden and the senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make the decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD in a rally to support Donald Trump.
26-year-old Treque Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son's going through now, what he's going through after his return, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are going to go home with," she said in front of a rally to support Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called Trac's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "come home the wrong way they used to be, more cruel, and want to know if they respect here what their soldiers, pilots and other military officers have done for this country."
According to a spokesman for the Vasil police department, Dan Bennett, Trac was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, and he interfered with the report of violence and carried weapons in a state of alcohol abuse.
18 states and the district of Colombia support complaints about asylum policies
Eighteen states and circuits in Colombia support a complaint against a new U.S. policy that denies refugee status to victims of gang persecution and domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and circuits sent an analytic note to a court adviser in Washington, D.C., to support the client who needs asylum and has appealed to the court for the policy.
The full name of the lender in the case of Grace v. Cechns, under the U.S. Civil Rights Alliance, which denounces federal politics and which was presented in August, is not open.
The client claimed that her partner, "and his cruel son-bandits," beat her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally held in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace's suit stated that the inhabitants of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (who often ask for asylum in the United States) often face serious problems, such as gang violence and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status reverses the decision of the Migration Board in 2014, that immigrants without documents who fled from domestic violence could ask for asylum.
The attorney general of the district of Colombia, General Karl Reysin, stated on his Friday talk that the new policy “has ignored decades of state, federal and international law. ”
“Federal law requires that the decision to grant refugee status be based on the facts and circumstances presented in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle,” is the case in the Court Counselor's analytic note.
The prosecutor's analysis further points out that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the United States are harmful to the economy because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill the necessary labor resources."
In June, attorney general Jeff Ceshns issued an order for immigration judges that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
"The asylum is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of racial belonging, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," stated Ceshnes in his presentation of politics on June 11.
The purpose of asylum was never to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers desperately seek out survivors while the death toll in Pala doubled
For those who survive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, quick help brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water."
Some people go back to their devastated homes, take over their flooded possessions, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals that have been damaged by an earthquake with an earthquake of seven and a half points on the Richter scale are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including two broken backs and shoulders, are resting outside the Pala army hospital building, where patients are cared for in the open air because of repeated pushes.
His eyes were filled with tears when he remembered how powerful a shock had shaken the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I'm trapped in the debris of the wall," told Geris to correspondent Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife beg for help, and then the silence reigned.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador blames China for "exercising psychological pressure" with the "advertising that contains propaganda."
A week after the Chinese national newspaper had placed four pages of American daily advertising material on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to a pay supplement to China Daily at Des Moons Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to influence elections to Congress on November 6, China rejects these accusations.
According to Reuters, official officials in the United States reported that Trump's claims that he accused Beijing of trying to intervene in American elections mean a new phase of escalation from Washington, D.C., whose goal is to pressure China.
While foreign governments can advertise to activate trade, a trade war is now being escalated between Beijing and Washington, where they have already raised the import command.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of the oppressive customs in China was intended to strike exporters from such states as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest agricultural exporter to China, claimed that China had harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in a column in the Sunday release of Des Moines Register, "energizes the pressure by publishing advertising that contains propaganda, in our independent press."
"To spread propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, placing a pay ad in Des Mountains Register," wrote Brunstead.
"In contrast, on the street layouts here in Beijing, you will only find individual voices of dissatisfaction, and here you will not see the true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is disturbing, which leads to the conclusion that Chinese media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the respectful Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but did not name which.
Analysts warn that the failure of Cavanaugh by Republicans to set up a female vote against themselves before the intermediate elections.
Since many prominent Republicans support and protect the candidate for the position of Justice of the Supreme Court of Britta Cavanaugh after several charges of sexual harassment have been brought against him, analysts warn that this could cause an undesirable reaction to future inter-elections, especially in women.
This situation is surrounded by passion, and most Republicans publicly claim that they would like to proceed to the vote.
These things can't be played back later," he said in an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday, by Grant Richter, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University School.
Riger doubted that the FBI investigation, at the last moment demanded by senator Jeff Flake (a writer from Arizona), would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the chief adviser and spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group, Catherine Jean-Perrieur said on Friday, "The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning the protesters sang "The Face Is Coming" at a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when the Republics decided to move on to Cavanaugh's confirmation despite Dr. Christine Blazey Ford's testimony.
In an interview with the news website of Stu Rotenberg, a outside political observer, he said, "People will be extremely interested and interested."
"It's said to be so now, and it's true.
But motivation can increase, especially in 18 to 29-year-old female voters, who have not yet been defined and often do not vote if they dislike the president."
Even before Ford gave a testimony in connection with the charges of a Supreme Court judge for sexual crimes, analysts predicted the negative reaction of the voters if the Republics insisted on confirmation.
According to NBC News, earlier this week the former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, declared, "This is a unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
In an interview with the news channel, the director of priorities USA (a group that helps with the democratic campaign) Guy Cecil, "it's not about voting a committee, voting a final vote, or Cavanaugh's taking the stand for the defendant, but how they reacted to this situation and how they acted."
However, Americans' thoughts about whether to believe, ford or Cavanaugh, are divided, and a little bit more backed by Ford.
According to a new YouTube poll, 41 percent of the respondents believe or rather believe in Ford’s testimony, while Cavanaugh’s testimony either believes or believes 35% of those interviewed.
In addition, 38 percent of those surveyed said that they thought Cavanaugh was giving or was likely giving false testimony, whereas 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after his insistence on it, the FBI is checking the charges against Ford and another lender, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Juridical Committee about Cavanaugh's attack on her while she was in a state of alcohol abuse when she was 17.
Ramirez stated that the candidate for the position of judge of the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at a party while they were studying at the Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global Internet is planning to start a "new Internet" to create a Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the global Internet, launches a new startup to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, the Inrupt company, is developing a platform with Open Source Solid, an idea that belongs to Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where to store data and to whom to access information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the Inrupt goal is "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said about the startup.
It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create a "personal online data store" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of current activities, a calendar, an audio library, and other self-use and work tools.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify at the same time.
A unique feature of this personal online data store is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities with data."
According to Inrupt director John Bruce, the company aims to activate resources, processes, and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
Nowadays, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several state developers hired to work on the project, and a volunteer programming community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own offline applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee claimed that he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to make a complete replacement when all their business models undergo radical changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Media Burners-Lee, the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate about online neutrality.
Even at the launch of the Inrupt Berners-Lee, he remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I look very optimistic at the next age of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the dedication of the Church's representative to the Order of the Cross of Victoria during World War I
The only representative of the Church of England who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria for fighting during World War I is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was rewarded for taking part in the Battle of Belangelism and Leocourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he died of a sniper’s bullet four days later and never knew that he had received Britain’s highest military reward.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a memorial stone during a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vanne, called "very symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vanne transferred his batalion across St. Kathen's Channel "through a very dense fog and under a dense fire of field cannons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the firefront and, with "sudden courage," led the force forward, before one broke into the cannon of the field and destroyed three cannons of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanne was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – a little over a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vanne said that his grandfather had done something that he would never have been able to repeat himself and that he deserved to be respected.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vanne, laid the crown after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vanne said, "I feel very proud to participate in this parade," and he added, "the courage of the true hero is demonstrated by the respect that so many people show him."
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they were shown Peppu's Pig.
Imagine that you are not sleeping all night just to watch the event of Bellator 206, and you are denied the opportunity to view the main event.
There were 13 battles in the San José tournaments, including six major program fights that were broadcast live in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., just before Hegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to get together in a fight, the British TV viewers were surprised when Peppa appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting.
Some spectators were not thrilled because they did not sleep until the morning while waiting for a fight.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a childhood cartoon seemed to him "some kind of bad joke."
"According to the government's decree of content, which was broadcast at 6: 00 a.m., it was inappropriate, so they had to have a child's broadcast," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and social relations with Bellator, when asked for a television broadcast,
Peppa's Pig, yes.
Bellator’s president, Scott Coker, has promised to work on a broadcast schedule to reach audiences in Britain in the future.
"I think if we talk about repeating the broadcast, we can do it," said Koker.
"But now it's Sunday, 6:00 a.m., and we can't do anything until we have Sunday and they're Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages that we responded to, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it turned out to be a mismatch with government regulations.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to reduce the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to redirect the signal to fans, but we're still putting off these attempts.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jump in the water, Tom Daily, tells us that he was growing, feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete claimed that he didn't understand that "not all look like him" until he went to high school.
By taking part in the Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he pointed out that he openly spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also claimed that his fatherhood had reduced his concern for winning the Olympic Games.
The conductor who has been running this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for a few months.
When he came as a couple on Laverne's first program, he said he felt worse than everyone else in his childhood, because "sociality doesn't take it when someone likes boys and girls."
He said, "To this time, the sense of inferiority and difference was exactly what gave me the strength and the power to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove that something was a "watchman" so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone who finally learned about his orientation.
A two-time bronze Olympic preser became a famous LBHT community rights fighter and used this year's Association Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He claimed that he spoke openly about his views because he was happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and he wanted to give this hope to others.
A three - time champion of the world admitted that his feelings for the man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 were a real surprise to him.
Daily married Oscar's winner, 20 years older, last year, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so many things at such a young age" (at the first Olympics, he performed at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who's also going through a similar fall and fall.
In June, the couple had a son called Robert Ray Black-Daly, and since then, according to Daily, his "worldliness" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd only think about what I should get gold," he said.
"You know, there are things far more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robby."
His son was named his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said that his father could not accept the thought of the end and asked before he died if they had purchased tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because they wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You won't be in the front row because you won't be around anymore," said Daily.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and gained bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that," said Daily.
It also inspired him to choose his first song, Proud, in the performance of Giser Small, which resonated with him in preparation for the Olympics and still summons the ants.
The Desert Island Discs program is released to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m. in English summertime.
On Saturday, Michaelson, who was not in shape, was released from the tournament for Ryder's Cup.
American Phil Miquelson made a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the "Ryder Cup" tournament, but he has to restore the form so he doesn't have to be unhappy.
Michaelson, who's been in a record 12th tournament every two years, got Captain Jim Furick out of the game at the time of the forblet and fortresses.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-time winner spent the whole day encouraging the team and training on the side, hoping to control his emotions.
Because Michelson was not famous for the good blows, even while he was in the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete was not exactly suitable for a difficult golf course, Le Gold National, where a raft usually punishes wandering blows.
And if that's not the case, at the ninth match on Sunday, Michaelson will have to meet the Open Champion and the Master of exact shots by Francesco Molinari, who won all his games this week with newer Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans who are three points behind 12 single matches start well, the Michelson match can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and he probably had nothing to add to that.
"He fully understood his role today, shuddered on my back, hugged me, and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He has no doubt about his powers.
Michaelson is a member of the Hall of Fame who did so much for the teams last week and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I've been predicting more matches, but that's how it worked out, so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there in the field like anyone else."
If Michaelson leaves the field on Saturday, he'll beat Nick Faldo's record, who played the biggest number of games in the Ryder Cup tournament.
He might be able to complete his career in the "Ryder Cup" tournament, which never matched his individual achievement.
At the expense of Michelson’s 18 victories, 20 defeats, and 7 no results, Furik said that his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's a guy who's cool to have on the team," explained Furik.
"I think the younger players had fun riding on him, and this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big break doesn't solve anything
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a remarkably lone-played match for the last day of the Ryder Cup is not yet a guarantee of victory.
Dutchman debuted in 1997 in a game at the Walderram Club, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros was ahead of the Americans by five points, but won the match with a slight break with a result of 41⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in a game at the Walderram field; a big break in Brookline where we lost, and in the Walderram field where we were forced to win," said Bjorn after watching Class 2018 victorious games with the result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at Le Gold National Stadium, followed by a break of 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has been solved yet.
We'll have to play with the best we can tomorrow.
Go out to the field and do what you need.
The game will only end when the result appears on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we are well aware of who's opposing us, the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a complicated field, Bjorn added, "I'll never run ahead.
Tomorrow things can be different.
We're expected to have a personal match tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's cool to play with your partner when things go well, but it's when you're standing there alone, and you can check what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to configure players to speak tomorrow: at the limit of opportunity.
You leave your partner with no support, and now he has to show you what he's capable of."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number of Jim Furick expects his partners to play a better game on a personal level, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Up until Furic's last day, fate came back by different sides: he was among the winners in Brookline, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created the Miracle in Medin.
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, organized players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, like it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone else's side, players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We put the players in the team, as if we were going, like, to do something incredible tomorrow."
Tomas is commissioned to try to lead the counter-attack at the top-match against Rory McGillroy, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Polter are on the first half of the European team.
"It's these partners that I chose in this order because I want to share the effort equally throughout the whole game," so Bjorn commented on his choice of players at the individual games.
The introduction of a new German warship was put off again
The most modern German navy frigate was to take effect as early as 2014, instead of the old battleships of the Cold War, however, according to local media, this will not happen until at least the next year because of broken systems and a rapid increase in spending.
According to Die Zeit newspaper, received from the spokesman for the military, the entry into operation of the Rhineland-Paltz, the main ship of a series of modern frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery affected the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, should be replaced by the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of antiaircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some technologies to reduce awareness, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of maintenance, and it is expected that new frigates will be able to avoid returning to the base port for about two years.
However, journalist Die Zeit warns that because of the ongoing delay, super-modern warships that were to increase Germany’s military power in the sea will become obsolete at the time of the invasion.
F125 hit the headlines when German naval forces officially refused to take the vessel into action and returned it to the Blohm + Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a ship returned to a shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are little known, but German media mentioned the significant “deficits of software and equipment ” that made the warship impossible for military operations.
The software deficits are particularly important because the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class of about 120 sailors is only half the number of soldiers who served on the old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it has found that the vessel has a considerable surplus of weight, which makes its exploitative characteristics worse and restricts its prospects for further upgrade.
The Rhineland-Paltz frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7000 tons) for ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to poor equipment, another problem has been the aggregate cost of the project, which also includes the cost of preparing the crew.
Expected 2.2 billion euros have been converted into a colossal 3.1 billion euros (US$3.6 billion).
Problems with getting new frigates have gained special weight in the light of recent warnings about the decline of German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, authorized by Hans-Peter Bartels, reported that the U.S. Navy had “a limited number of ships capable of carrying out combat. ”
The official stated that the situation had deteriorated rapidly for a time, since old ships had been out of business and no new ones had arrived.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to recapture the navy.
A national trust will observe the secret life of bats
A new study of landowning in Scotland's hills aims to determine how bats use the landscape to find food.
Scientists hope that the data received will shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals so that they can be preserved in the future.
In the gardens of Inveru in Wester-Ross, scientists at the Scottish National Trust will observe species such as dwarf neopy and pygmie neopy, as well as the ears of a normal and watery night.
Special registrars will be located in strategic locations in the land area to observe bat behavior during the season.
Workers and volunteers of the Scottish National Trust will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and fitness of bats ’ cries.
Then we plan to develop a detailed map of animal life and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their environment.
Rob Duard, a adviser on conservation in the national cost of Scotland, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures (e.g. meadowing) and determine the best ways to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the past century, bat populations have plummeted greatly in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened by the active construction and development of areas that rob them of their nesting grounds.
Other negative factors include wind stations and lighting, sticky fly paper, chemical processing of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The bats are actually not blind.
However, hunting at night makes their ears more effective in catching prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated sonar techniques to detect insects and obstacles to flight paths.
In the National Spending of Scotland, which handles over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, bats are taken seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, site checks, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, and it's in the area of Trev in the Dumfress and Galloway region, where eight of the ten bat species that live in Scotland were found.
The manager of David Thompson says it's an ideal place for them.
"In the area of the site, I've had wonderful conditions for bats," he assures me.
"There are old buildings here, many huge trees and other favorable living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot more about bats, and with the research we do here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to test the territory for bats before performing any technical work, since the unintentional destruction of one nesting site can kill up to 400 females with babies, which is likely to destroy the entire local population.
The bats and their nests are protected by law, and animals are forbidden to kill, torture, or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Center for Bat Conservation, urged the public to join the organization.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we haven't discovered the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects the charge of rape, and his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against the German edition
Cristian Ronald called the charge of rape a "false" and claimed that people were "trying to attract attention," using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German newsmagazine Der Spigel, which published suspect information.
American Kathryn Majorga accused the Portuguese forward and the Yuventus soccer club of rape, which happened in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to the magazine Der Spigel on Friday, Ronald allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet.
A few hours after the charges were made, 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to 142 million of his fans in a video broadcast to Instagram, calling the corresponding messages "scroll."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander," was the statement made by the five-time owner of the Golden Ball.
"They want to draw attention to themselves, using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to profit from me, but similar situations are part of my job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," added a football player, smiling.
According to the Reuters news agency, Ronald's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spigel for published charges, which they called an "unacceptable report of suspicion in private life."
The lawyer, Christian Shertz, stated that a football player would demand compensation for the "moral damage in size, which corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most common cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
A reported incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after meeting Ronald and Majorga at the nightclub, they returned to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her, and this testimony was transmitted to the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronald fell down in front of her and said he was a "99 percent good guy," and he gave up "one percent."
As noted in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with a model, but by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital where the injuries she received were photographed, but later she agreed to a prison policy because she was afraid of revenge and wasware of "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous deal, because she's still suffering from an incident that she says happened to happen.
At the time of the scheduled Ronald incident, he was preparing to go to FC Real Madrid with the Manchester U.S. FC, and this summer he became the player of the Grand Italian soccer team, the Yuventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will “forever regret ” the loss of automakers
Britain will be "long-termly sorry" if it loses its status as a world leader in automobile manufacturing after Brexit, which is warned by the minister of the economy, Greg Clark.
He added that he was thrilled by a statement by Toyota UK, who told BBC journalists that in the case of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, the company would have to suspend the production and operation of its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," assures Secretary Clarke.
A Japanese auto manufacturer stated that the effects of the delay on the border in the case of Brexit without a contract could cost jobs.
The Bernaston factory, which produces Toyota models of Auris and Avensis, released about 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain exits the EU sharply at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, director general of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain’s withdrawal from the EU will affect the non-union of international trade.
For example, BMW said that the Mini Model factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns about auto manufacturers are that Brexit without a contract can cause risks to supply chains.
Toyota's production line functions in rapid delivery of parts and materials according to the needs -- details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for automobiles made for order.
If, on March 29, Britain leaves the EU out of a deal, there may be a lack of detail on the border, resulting in delay and lack of materials.
As the company says, the Toyota warehouse can place no more than one day of detail, so it's going to have to stop production.
Greg Clark noted that the EU's plan for relations with Theresa May (Chequesers Plan) “is specifically designed to avoid problems on the border. ”
"We need a deal, and we need to make an optimistic deal that I think will enable not only to succeed at the moment but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the Today program at BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's representatives and other auto manufacturers, we need to preserve well-formed high-performing supply chains."
In Toyota, it was not possible to tell you how long the production would be stopped, but in the long run, it is expected that higher costs will reduce the company's ability to compete and, as a result, make it cut jobs.
Peter Tswalaris, head of the U.S. trade union at a factory in Bernaston, who worked here for 24 years, reported that other participants are extremely concerned, "I can tell from experience that short jobs are not being restored."
A representative of the government said, "We have made an accurate and reliable plan to shape our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein’s meeting can be delayed again, as noted in the White House
According to White House officials on Sunday, the responsible meeting between Donald Trump and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "defer for another week" while discussions continue about Britta Cavanaugh's candidacy as Judge of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's involvement in elections, relations between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential interference with justice on the part of the president.
For a few months in Washington, D.C., the possibility of the release of the deputy attorney general is being debated, endangering the independence of Muller.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about using microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of terminating the President's 25th correction.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House in the background of reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump claimed that "wouldn't want to" release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coincidence with the Senate Juridical Committee meeting where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation of the FBI into the charges against Cavanaugh, which added to the vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, performed on Fox News Sunday.
To a question about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not set, maybe this week it will take place, and I expect it to be postponed for another week, in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I keep watching the press have the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not conduct a mailing session for media in the White House since September 10.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the frequent conduct of the brifings was not associated with the unkindness of public games by TV reporters, although she added, "I can't deny that they're playing public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
"The president answers questions more often than any president to him," she said, adding, without referring to the source, "Statistic speaks for itself."
Sanders pointed out that the breetings are still going to be held, but "if the press has a chance to ask the U.S. president a question, it's better than talking to me."
We're trying to talk to the press a lot, and it should have been particularly noticeable in the last few weeks, and the possibility of talking to the U.S. president is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when outside the White House, open meeting, or press conference for high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York City this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so by speaking to the journalists in a way that's odd.
The State Secretary for Health of Scotland addressed a letter to EU employees in connection with fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health addressed a letter to citizens of other EU countries who work in the National Health Service in Scotland to express their appreciation for their work and ask for it to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom resigned from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for permanent migration for EU citizens who work in autonomous government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said, "For the past summer, there were negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the issue of exit, and it's fall that we have to wait for the appropriate solutions.
But the U.K. government is intensifying preparations for a possible exit without a treaty.
I know this may be a very disturbing time for you.
That's why I'd like to emphasize again how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Groups from all over the European Union and countries outside it share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving health services for the benefit of the patients and communities we care for.
Scotland is your home, we really want you to stay."
Christion Ebercrombie had an emergency operation after a head injury
Half-back of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Ebercromby, performed an emergency operation after he had suffered a head injury in a Sunday match against the Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team lost at 31:27.
The chief coach of Tennessee State Tigers told the reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He came to the side line where he was angry," said Reed.
On the sideline, the coaches and the medical staff gave Ebercrombie oxygen before taking it on the load for further testing.
The official representative of Tennessee State Tigers told Chris Harris from WSMV, Nashville, Tennessee, that Ebercrombie had operated at the University of Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "until this time there is no evidence of the type and severity of the injury," on the Tennessee State Tigers team, they're trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-year student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after he moved from the Illinois team.
He did five captures of the ball on Sunday before he quit the game, so in the season he's got 18 captures.

In the Ministry of Finance, an additional 120 million pounds a year is expected to be used to help the homeless.
As Teresa May announced today, foreigners who buy real estate in Britain are going to pay more taxes, and more money is going to be spent to help the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing for highly paid workers.
The raising of customs will involve physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the government will provide additional funds to help those who are forced to spend the night in the open sky.
An additional towel, accompanied by a two - year - old increase in housing and real estate for renting, may be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects an additional 120 million pounds a year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate that's being built in London is going to be owned by foreign citizens, and this leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for people who just dream of their own housing.
Many of the rich regions of the country, especially in the capital, are deserted because a large number of foreign buyers most of the time live outside the country.
A new plan of action appeared just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lower national tax to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of real estate by buying land without further use of it, and he urged Theresa May to give up the quota of available real estate to fix the "dishonest situation in the housing market" in Britain.
Corbin announced a series of important reforms in the realm of immobility, such as the control of rent and the failure to expel without valid reasons.
He also offers to extend the authority of the local council in the construction of new housing.
Theresa May said, "I promised that I would dedicate my premiere to the restoration of the British dream -- for every new generation of life should be better.
This calls for changes in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always remain open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in Britain and foreign companies buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own housing has become unattainable, and the problem of living in the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "Most of all, I want to be the chief coach of the Scots Congregation."
Chief FK coach Sanderland, Jack Ross, says that "the most desirable thing" will ever be to lead Scotland's collection.
A 42-year-old Scotsman went to rebuild the club from the northeast of the country, which is now third in the first soccer league, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning the last season of the FC Saint Mirren to the Prime Minister of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to the second collection in Scotland, but that's all over," Ross told me during the Sportsboard program at the BBC Scottland radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of the collective Scotland at Hampden Park Stadium.
The only hope for me is to be successful as head coach of the club."
The predecessors of Ross to the FC Sanderland were Dick the lawyer, David Moys, Sam Ellardays, Martin O'Neil, Roy King, Gustavo Point, and Paulo de Canio.
Former FC Chief Trainer Alla Atlettick claims that he didn't feel nervous about going to a big club following such authoritative names before he rejected the offers from FC "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"I'm now going to think I'm successful if the club returns to the Prime Minister League.
Because of its structure and its material and technical support, this club is no doubt equal to the prime minister of the league," he noted.
"It's not going to be easy, but the other result I don't think is going to be successful."
Ross has been a coach for only three years, and he's been a second coach at the FC Dumbarton, and he's spent 15 months at FC's Garths.
Then he helped "Hello" get ready after FC got to the third division, and in the next season, from St.
According to Ross, he's feeling more comfortable now than ever during his FC game career at Clyde, Gartlpool, Folkerque, St. Merren, and Hamilton Academy.
"I'm at a crossroads," he recalls, referring to the transition to the FC "Hello."
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more appropriate to me than playing.
That sounds strange, because I was successful, I was good at it, and I got some heights.
But playing is very difficult.
There are many challenges that each week must be overcome.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as a chief coach, I feel at my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt more comfortable in my adult life than since I chose this profession."

Study: 5:30 a.m. Sunday is the perfect time for a beer cook
The summer heat has helped to increase the revenue of British pubs, which are experiencing bad times, but has increased the pressure on the restaurant networks.
According to the estimates, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 22.7 percent, while the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA, who consults on business development, said, "Because of the sun’s weather and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup, July passed the same pattern as the previous month, when the revenue grew by 22.7 percent, and restaurants went even worse.
The Inner fall by 1/2 in July increased.
Pubs and bars that are focused on the supply of drinks, so far they have the best scores -- the increase in their profits is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
Food - serving paws were also affected by heat, but not as much as restaurants.
Visitors seem to be interested only in drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, the sale of drinks in a month increased by 6.6 percent, and the sale of food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst of the leisure and hotel department at RSM, said, "We've seen similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large - scale social or sports events remain major factors affecting sales on the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, groups of restaurants continue to lose their profits, and the annual decline in sales by 4.9 percent is a special concern about the need to reduce expenses.
A long hot summer didn't come at the best time for food - let's see if the temperament we saw in August can give them the needed rest."
The general increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, in July has been 23.7 percent, reflecting the slowing down of new brands.
A Gallusian measure of the sales volume of Coffer Peach Tracker in the U.K. pubs, bars, and restaurants sector is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance of 47 working groups, whose aggregate sales exceed 9 billion pounds [9 billion pounds]. This is a generally accepted industry standard.
One out of every five kids has a hidden social networking account from their parents.
Research shows that 1 out of every 5 children, sometimes under 11 years of age, have a hidden social networking account from parents and teachers.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram
This news has intensified concerns about possible sexual content
20% of the students said they had a "basic account" that they showed their parents.
One out of every five children, sometimes less than 11 years of age, creates a social networking account that hides from adults.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram — a social network to exchange photographs.
This news has intensified concerns about possible sexual content.
20 percent of the students reported having a clean "basic" account that was shown to their parents and to one or more private ones.
Mother, who accidentally stumbled upon the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a call to rape me.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and HMC in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social networking profiles. Half of these children admitted that an additional account is secret.
The head of the HMC Association, Mike Buchanan, said, "We're very concerned that many teenagers feel that they want to create an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elide Doyle will be the "Athletic interests representative" on the Scotty Athletics Council.
Aide Doyle was elected to the Scotty Athletics Council as independent director of the annual general board.
Doyle, who found Scotland's best lightweight athletic, the chairman of the Yeon Beatty Council called this a great opportunity for those who lead the sporting movement to take advantage of its extensive experience at the international level during the last decade.
"Aylid has great respect among the athletes of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we're convinced that if we get her involved in the council, the athletic sport in Scotland will be of great benefit," Beatty assured.
Doyle said, "Inspired to act as a representative of athletes, I hope that I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland."
An American, a four-time Olympic champion who won 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and now a BBC sports tourner, lost the opportunity to go through a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote in Twitter, "That month I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much.
As a result of my incredible efforts, I have been able to recover fully, and I have learned to walk again, and I am doing dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for your words of support!"
In advertising, women's milk suckers were compared to cows -- the opinions of the Internet users were divided.
A sucker manufacturer has encountered a vague reaction of the Internet user to an advertisement that compares young mothers to active cows.
In recognition of the release of a product called the world's first quiet soft milk sucker, Elvie's consumer manufacturing company published an ad in a humorist music video to demonstrate the freedom that a new sucker provides for mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cow cow under a song that says, "Yes, I'm feeding myself, but I don't have a tail," and, "As you can see, it's not a spell, it's my chest."
And then he sings, "Suck it, suck it to feed the kids, suck it, suck it, don't waste milk."
However, a commercial published on the Facebook company page led to a turbulent discussion online.
Video's got 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the reaction of the Internet users has been unclear, and many have noted that the advertisements underestimate the "horrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
"It's not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their children are taken away from them a few days after birth, ” wrote one of the users.
Elvie milksucker can easily be hidden in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "It's obvious that it's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a milk sucker for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone added, "This ad is so far from reality."
And the other users came up to defend the ad, and one of the women in the video was "so much fun."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would certainly have bought something like that if I had still breast - feeding.
When I sucked my milk, I really felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I didn't look for hidden content in it.
It's a great product," wrote someone.
Here's another comment: "A funny ad that's designed for moms who suck milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This ad is not about highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show milksuckers hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use such products feel like cows.
But Elvie's sucker works perfectly quietly, has no wires or tubes, and easily hides in a breast-feeder for feeding, which allows women to move freely, hold children, and even go outside.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive director of the Mother Advertising Agency, commented on this situation: "The Elvie Sucker is so revolutionary that it requires a bright and provocative presentation.
After a parallel between women who heal milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the particulars of breast - feeding, in an exciting and interesting way, showing the incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker would bring.
Elvie sucker does not first get into news headers.
Within the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on a show with this product while displaying clothing from model Martha Yakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent town on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children increased dramatically, although the monthly crossing of the border remained relatively constant, partly because harsh rhetoric and politics by Trump administration made it difficult to place children in caretakers.
Traditionally, most of the time, immigrants themselves have acted as caregivers without documents, and now they are afraid to endanger their own ability to stay in the country by offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to give fingerprints and that this data would be passed to immigration agencies.
Last week Matthew Albins, a senior official of the Bureau of Migration and Tax Control, testified before Congress that the Office’s colleagues had arrested dozens of people who had applied to care for teenagers without escort.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Around 80 percent of people who are caregivers or members of their households are in the country illegally, many of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Albins.
According to the asylum officials, to handle children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some of the children to appear in court within a month after being arrested, not 60 days later, as they used to be.
Many of them will be able to use a video conference instead of coming to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who are not granted asylum by a court decision will be quickly deported.
According to the shelter workers and official data from officials in recent months, the longer the children are under guard, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or escape.
Protectors claim that these problems are intensified in institutions of larger size, such as Tornillo, where the psychological state of children is more difficult to monitor.
They added that by moving our children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to their friends, we are at risk of increasing the trauma that many of them have already suffered.
Syria ordered the United States, France, and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Moreover, in addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualham called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been in war for eight years.
Mualem, who also works as a deputy prime minister, claimed that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the influence of the fight against terrorism, so "to be treated properly."
"They have to go immediately and not make a deal," he stated at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war on terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He claimed that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The U.S. has placed about 2,000 military officers in Syria, mainly teaching and consulting the Kurd forces and Syrian Arabs, who are speaking against President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war - torn country, France carried over 1,000 soldiers.
As for refugees, Mualem assured them that the country had the right conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" of spreading "unreasonable fears" that prevented refugees from returning.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help people come back," he said.
"We observe an attempt to politicize a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not help Syria rebuild countries until the political treaty between Assad and the opposition to the end of war has been concluded.
U.N. scholars will report that the recent treaty between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlibu, the last large area of the rebels, has opened the way for political negotiations to continue.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish treaty, it was possible to prevent large-scale Syrian forces supported by Russia from attacking a province of three million people.
But Mualem stressed that the treaty has "small terms," and he expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the protesters, including the Al-Qaida-related fighters of the al-Qaida Front al-Nasr, who would be "destroyed."
UN Embassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to hold the first sessions of a new committee, which will include government and opposition, in order to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem set out conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, stating that its work should be limited to “a review of the articles of the valid constitution, ” and warned against intervention.
Why Trump will be re-selected
According to this logic, Trump can be reconfigured in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, he does not make up his authority in time after scandal and impeachment.
No doubt it would be the most dramatic end of the presidentship in all time!
At the moment, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and has actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Madow Show on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of a rating of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when major news was being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our comprehension," said Neil Behr, executive producer of the last candidate drama on ABC's channel about the secretary of state who becomes president after the destruction attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovell, an experienced humour writer and author of the book "The Only Funny moments: and a few hard truths about entering the Hollywood men's club," offers another theory.
She recalled a trip to a Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's laughing at me," he said.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington can determine the future of Row versus Wade, the possibility of reuniting immigrant families, and the state of the world economy.
Avoiding is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it can't be said that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you watch a team of experts talk about Bob Woodward's use of "good-known" sources for his book The Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket, and the effects of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Tramp's anatomy published by Stormy Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be an ex.
"The sense of a reality show is partly connected to the fact that you are converging on something new every night," remarked Brent Montgomery, chief executive director of Weelhouse Entertainment, and author of the TV program "The Pawnbard Stars," about rotating in an actor's pool, and daily storybacks on the "Tramp" show.
If you allow yourself to skip one episode, you can be hopelessly behind.
When I was able to meet Mr. Flace this week in his house on the north coast of Cauai Island, there was warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV -- not when Britt Cavanaugh stood before the Senate Juridical Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hanged in the hair.
"I remember when we were creating all these crazy shows, and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I took it as a joke, but it looks like they were right."

External Infusions in the Hardest Intermediate Selection to Congress
It's no wonder that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, there's an extra cash flow, because by looking at the boundaries of the election regions, two valid congressmen are running for one chair.
This suburb of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, is joined by a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lemb, who won a victory in another region in the additional elections last spring.
Lemb stands up to another valid congressman, the Republican of Kit Rothfs, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are much the same as the new 17th.
The maps were converted after, in January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old limits of the circuits were set in favor of the Republicans, contrary to the constitution.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused severe opposition between the financial subdivisions of the major parties, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee of Congress (DCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (RCC).
The name Lemba came to be very famous in Pennsylvania after winning with a minimal advantage in the 18th district during the additional elections at Congress in March, which took public attention.
President Donald Trump won a 20-point victory in this area.
Political experts have given little advantage to the Democrats.
In the United States, we considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for support of China, but we changed our minds
Diplomas recalled Washington’s weak opposition to the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 1951, Trump had a warm meeting with President Pans, Juan Carlos Varela, and Trump had a hotel in Panama before his partners took out the personnel hired by Trump Organization.
The officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the leaders of the U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions about Taiwan’s ignorance, ” declared the press secretary of the Department of Gezer Neuert earlier this month.
But it was only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in American aid in the field of drug control in 1951, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included cutbacks in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this country of Central America with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As a result of the internal governing body of the North and Central American nations, the conference was postponed at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, followed by an analytic set last year, and was viewed as a step forward in efforts to curb the flow of immigrants in the United States.
But by the middle of September, high officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and in fact, that's where the issue of the authorization against El Salvador came to an end.
According to the diplomacy, Vice President Mike Pans is now planning to speak at a conference that is scheduled for mid- Oct. to indicate that the administration considers this to be very important.
At the same time, three American messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there were no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s representative in the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that three American officials, two of whom were missionaries, had made on anonymous terms.
Their information was confirmed by a foreign analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on anonymous terms.
Learn History
The next problem may be a report by special prosecutor Robert Muller on possible interference with justice on the part of Trump, which is powerful evidence of why you can find it in the public information currently available.
As part of his investigation, Muller is reported to be checking the possible link between Trump's campaign and the attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence of Congress moves into other hands, Trump will have to report to Congressmen, just as it does to the voters and eventually to the same party.
There's a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't want to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, just like his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that determines the duration of the fight.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to set up a coup against Hitler if only the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is determined by such crucial moments, and the uncontrollable movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are facing a number of moments like this.
What will we do if Trump fires attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who depends on Mr. Muller's fate?
Rosenstein was in trouble when this newspaper had information that he had suggested secretly recording conversations with the president and sharing his thoughts on the subject of Trump's incompatibility.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times untruthful.
"How will we react if the investigation against Britta Cavanaugh, which recently started by the FBI, turns out not to be thorough enough or honest enough, or if Cavanaugh's candidacy is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite strong accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, will we, in the medium term, vote for those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech - speaking Jew who was deported to Auschwitz to the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador’s house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light Saturday candles on the swastika table.
With such an inheritance, can I not look with optimism into the future?"
Norman Aysen, senior scientist at the Brookings Institute, head of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, D.C., author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legal House.
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting the Vienna Rapid.
FC Rangers takes Rapid on Thursday, and after an astounding nothing in Spain in the game of Villarreal at the beginning of this month's victory over the Austrians, the Scottish club will provide a good chance of getting out of Group G of the European League.
Because of the knee injury, Half Protector Graham Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a match with "Villarreal," which ended with a score of 2:2, but he believes that FC Rangers can use this as a tramplin to achieve more.
"This was a good result for us, because "Villarreal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with hope of getting something and got one point.
Perhaps at the end of the match, we could go forward, but nothing in general can be considered a fair result.
At the first time, the adversary was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation in our favor.
On Thursday, there will be another important opposition in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not going to be easy, and our future opponents have shown good results in their last game, but we can rely on support for the fans, and I'm sure we can give a fight and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, starting with my injuries and ending up with the changes in the club itself, but now things are getting normal.
We have a great warehouse, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can move on, leave behind last season and succeed."
Women Suffer From the Fear of Retirement
Although the surveyers had a clear idea of how they would like to organize their own care, few spoke to their family.
About half of the people who were involved in the Nationwide study said that they were talking to their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% of those surveyed talked about it with the kids.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't rush to start talking about this," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Department of Life Insurance.
That's where you start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children, your family will not be able to provide the care you need unless you tell your parents your wishes in advance.
Consult your consultant and family to determine where and how you receive care, since this choice may be an important factor in determining the cost.
Include a financial consultant who can recommend how to cover the costs involved.
The sources of long - term care finance include the traditional insurance policy, the hybrid life insurance policy, or self - provision at your own expense (as long as you have money).
Carefully prepare legal documents — this will prevent legal burdens from taking place in advance.
Prepare trust for a representative who will control your health care and make sure that your wishes are done if you cannot do so personally.
In addition, it is recommended that trust be established at the expense of money.
Select a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills if you fail.
Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs immediate medical attention, so he is taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?

In Ilfrakum, a man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man was shot several times from a pneumatic rifle when he came home from a party.
A 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfrakum, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
The officers described the shooting that took place at 2:30 p.m. in British summertime as "random."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds are not a threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palou on Friday, reports government officials, but the number of casualties can go up.
Because of the breakup of the communications system, officials working on humanitarian assistance cannot get any information from the Council of Dongal, a region north of Pale, which is near the magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic pulmonary magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic pulmonary magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic pulmonary magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic puls and magnetic magnetic magnetic systems are magnetic resistant.
After a natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Consider some basic facts about the island of Sulawesi, the city of Palu, and the Dungalgent.
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 according to the data for the year 1951.
When the tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regentship that stretches more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulaves.
According to the 1717 census, the administrative region in the lower part of the province has a population of some 299,000.
Fishing and agriculture are the main areas of economic activity in central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morvala, on the opposite coast of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Pala and Dongala have suffered from tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938 the tsunami killed more than 200 people in Dongal and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, and then nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active Pacific fire ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: At the end of March, early in April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 points struck the southern part of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and caused tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra, an earthquake with a magnetic magnitude of 0.6 points was observed.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7,5 points hit one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra and caused a tsunami of up to 20 feet [10 m] high, killing dozens of villages and killing some 300 people.

His mother, Sarah Palin, phoned the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is now before the Alaska Veterans ’ Court.

In Indonesia an earthquake caused tsunamis: hundreds died
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawes on Friday.
A 7,5 - point earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The communications and electricity networks have come out, and the number of victims can increase in the near future.
The earthquake occurred near the center of Sulawesi Island, northeast of the capital city of Djacarta, Indonesia.
The video that spreads on social networks shows the moment when nature hits.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of Palu when the tsunami landed.
Federal accusers require a rare death penalty for the suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
In New York City, federal accusers demand the death penalty of Syfullo Saïp, suspected of terrorist attacks in New York City, resulting in eight deaths – a rare penalty that has not been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
It is said that in October 30-year-old Saïpipe, while driving a rented pickup at Home Depot, drove on a bicycle track along the highway in the West Side, Lower Manhattan, and started beating off the cyclists and pedestrians that he had on his way.
In line with the report of the intention to get executed in the South District of New York to justify the death penalty, the accusers must prove that Syipov's willfully killed eight people and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the judicial records, each of these counts has the possibility of capital punishment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of the jury charged Syipou for 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of demanding that the federal accusers usually file for organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the accusers, who described Saïp's crime as "horrible, cruel, and malicious," this attack is the result of "real planning and a preconceived reason."
Saiphul's victims were Diego Enrice Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernán Ferruche, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnacko, as described in the message of purpose.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time a capital offense was committed in the South District of New York City.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the federal death penalty was executed in New York in 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the judicial records of Saïp, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the police that he did not regret what he had done.
According to Sayipov’s guilty act, he informed the authorities that he had been inspired to launch an attack on an IDl video that he was watching on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang the IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He did not find himself guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public advocates who represents Sayipova, said that they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and sentence eternal imprisonment without the possibility of release only reinforces the psychological trauma caused by these events on the part of all victims," said Patton.
Sayipov’s defense party had also earlier asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
The MP of the Conservative Party believes that NYJEL FARAJA needs to be appointed to be in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Today, during the protest at the Congress of the Conservative Party, Nelson Faraj promised to "mobilize the national army."
Former leader of the United Kingdom independence party stated that politicians should “hear pressure ” from the European Union because one of the members of Parliament, Theresa May, had offered his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
The MP of the Conservative Party, Peter Bowe, stated on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "been coming out" if Mr. Faraj were secretary of Brexit.
The attention to the problems Mae faced in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks was further attracted by the fact that MPs from the Conservative Party, who opposed the exit, joined a special protest campaign in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is trying to implement the Chequers compromise plan despite attacks by Brexit, those who oppose the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will not give up her efforts to negotiate with her despite the negative reaction, and that she will make the Europscaptics and the Laborists choose between what she offers and "chaos."
At the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solichal, Mr. Bow said he wanted to "return from Chequers."
He suggested that Mr. Faraj step out of the shadow and take responsibility for the negotiations with Mr. Faraj.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out now," he said.
Parliament MP Wellingborough added, "I'm going to support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We didn't fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bowe rejected the assumption that after the vote in 2016, public opinion changed: "The idea that the British had changed their minds and refused to come out is completely untrue."
A member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit, Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, "Premier Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not backed by our party and our activists, who are actually walking through the streets and fighting for the votes of the voters.
Please reject Cheques and start listening."
In her address to Theresa May, she added, "The prime minister keeps his office when he fulfills his promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians should be pressured if they were to give up a decision made at the 2016 summit.
"Now it's a question of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them they're not going to get away with it."
In a report to a enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, who is planning to betray Brexit, to feel pressure.
We're mobilizing the national army of this country that will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-conscious, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the opponents went through Birmingham and then held a two - hour rally in the center of the city.
Several activists waved the banners Conservatives vs. Brexit after the group was launched on these weekends.
Laborist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives because security problems had arisen since the opening of the conference because of their party program.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and the technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing good about Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to think seriously about running for president.
U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the election in November, she would "think seriously about running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the general congregations in West Massachusetts, a representative of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, runs for a second term in November against a member of the Jeff Deal Republican Party, who was a co-leader of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is viewed as the main candidate that can fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she had her 36th meeting with the voters in the general assembly format since Trump took office.
The speaker asked her if she was planning to participate in the election as president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up the government, and for that to happen, there must be a woman in his head."
Suspect was arrested for murder by the basketball player LSU Tigers Sims.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the police reported that Wade Sims, a suspected gunman, had been arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a press conference at 11 o'clock in the East.
On Friday, they published a shooting video asking for help to identify a person on it.
20-year-old Simms was shot at the University of Southern campus on Friday morning.
"Wade Sims got a gunshot wound in the head and died as a result," declared 247sports police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade pleaded for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found to be at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun with him, and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken into custody at the East Baton police station.
Sims, whose height was 6 feet and 6 inches, and who was in the Junior League, grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 stars in the last season, and spent an average of 17.4 minutes in the field, dialing 5.6 points and 2.9 pickups.
Louis Hamilton shortened the fight for the world championship after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettel.
From the moment that Walter Bottas left behind Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well with the poul-posts and nearly passed Hamilton, who tried to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel an opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to the pit stop first and left Himilton on the road in the tail of the race, which was supposed to solve everything.
The Mercedes crew pilot drove another circle and left behind Fettel, but Hamilton ran into the leaders after a certain wheel maneuver, causing Ferrari’s driver to reluctantly leave the interior space because of the risk that he would be clamped, after a double maneuver had managed to make his way forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstapin started from the back of the net and stayed in seventh place until the end of the first circle.
Then he led most of the race, since he did not change the tires to get to the finish quickly and move Kimi Rykkonen out of fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at the pit stop on the 44th knee, but he couldn't increase the pace at the last eight, so Rykkonen sat fourth.
"It's a hard day, because Walthery was full on all weekends, and he was nobility when he gave me the opportunity to pass.
The team did an extraordinary job to get first and second place," said Hamilton.
The Language of the Body Was Not Impressed
At a Saturday meeting, President Donald Trump ridiculed senator Diane Feynstein for her firm stand that she did not announce the contents of a letter from Christine Blazey Ford, who accuses a candidate in the Supreme Court of Britta Cavanaugh of sexual violence.
During a speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the presentation given by Ford to the Legal Committee of the Senate, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate that he said had demonstrated human "insolence, vileness and lying."
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful thing that's been happening in the Senate for the last few days is anger, you see the evil people who are displaying vileness, vileness and lying," he said.
"You're looking at the publications and the information that you're publishing, and then they're like, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feynstein, did you share the information?
Remember her answer... did you advertise the contents of the documents? — “What?
Oh, no.
I didn't advertise."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't advertise," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July Feynstein came a letter with a detailed statement of charges against Cavanaugh, and in early September his contents were made public, but Feynstein denied that the leak of information had taken place in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't share the information I received from her," said Feynstein to the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn't break my promise."
But her objection seems to have displeased the president who commented at the Saturday meeting, "I'll tell you, her body language wasn't at all astonishing.
She may not have done it, but I haven't seen anyone worse."
Continuing to defend a candidate to the Supreme Court who was accused of sexual violence by three women, the president assumed that the democratics were using charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power in any necessary way.
You see vileness, vileness, they don't care who they're offended, who they need to step over to gain power and control," – Mediaite quotes the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars -- Belfast Jayantz, 5:3
Player Patrick Dwayer dropped two pucks in a match against Dundee.
Dundee Stars were rehabed for a five-hour defeat in the elite league from Belfast Giants, winning a five-three-third match on Saturday.
The Jaiants were given an early advantage of two pucks, thanks to Patrick Duyer and Francis Boville.
Mike Sallyvan and Jordan Cooney leveled the score in a home match, and then Dwayer redirected the Jants.
The Dundee player, François Bushard, leveled the score, and two of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's scores guaranteed their victory.
This is the third defeat of Adam Keef's team in the elite league season, who won a free victory over Dundee with a score of 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
It's the fourth team meeting in the season.
Dwayer's first puck dropped at four minutes (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall McFall, and four minutes later, Boville, who got a puck from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period of fourteen minutes (13:10), Salivan returned the landowners to the game, and for sixteen minutes (15: 16) Kooney, after receiving a puck from Matt Markwardt, compared the score.
Dwayer gave the Jaants the advantage before the first break, throwing his second puck at the end of the first period.
The masters of the fields regrouped, and Bushard at 28 minutes (27:37) rebalanced the score by dropping the puck when his team had a huge majority.
Thanks to the efforts of Coney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen, at the end of the second period, for the first time led Dundee forward and assured his team to win in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Jaints team, who has already lost four of the last five matches, will play a race against Milton-Kines.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on a plane could escape an earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared hero after he had helped to fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives after the severe earthquake that caused the tsunami on the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Underground tremors continue to rock the area, and many people are trapped in the city of Palu.
But unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agun refused to leave his post in a highly dispersed control tower at the Mutira SIS Al-Juffry Airport in Pala.
He stayed there to make sure that flight 6321 to Batik Air, who was on the landing strip at the time, was safely lifted into the air.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought it was breaking down.
He later died in the hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian Aeronautical Service Company, Johannes Sirite, stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balipapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're very sorry to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, because the disaster relief agency of the country claims that access to Dongala, Siga, and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims can go up because a lot of bodies are still under the rubble, and many of them cannot be reached," said a representative of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six feet [6 m] have devastated the city of Pala, where mass burials will be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes provide relief and food.
Rhysa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute, quick help brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-marquets are everywhere mugged."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfund, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they're going to find.
It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Vido, arrived in Pale on Sunday and said to the country's military officers, "I ask you all to work day and night to do all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on the island of Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reported that after the plane fell into the lagoon, one man disappeared.
The airline flying in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one person disappeared, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini said that it was impossible to find a single passenger on Saturday.
The airline company reports that its representatives are trying to find a husband and are working with local authorities, hospitals, and inquirers to do so.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane fell on the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials announced that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all stable.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in a lagoon near the landing strip.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has flown through the landing lane.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was very low above the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told us that he and others were able to get to the emergency exits on a thin plane by waisting in the water.
He told us that the stewardess panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. navy reported that sailors working near the modernisation of the quay also helped with rescue operations, bringing people to shore by means of an inflatable boat before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Air Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people have died in plane accidents related to PNG airlines, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution took action against a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rollett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified as an expert in the field of operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to replicate the movement of 29-year-old accused Queenton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette, according to The Clary Ledger, reported that he had received the location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers that evening when she died, which contradicted his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, he gave a witness and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the accusers were asked if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said he was in the Sanford pike that night, Sanford said he was "blowing, because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another incompatibility was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulette explained that some time after Chambers Tellis’s death, he removed text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Gail said.
The defense must present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be transferred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop-guilty wants to challenge a negative view of the genre, filling his music with constructive messages.
The High Bried Group of Bristol says that hip-hop changed its nature -- it's gone with political ideas and the struggle to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the origins and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugues and Commons recently witnessed the revival of this trend in the United Kingdom through groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
In New York City, the nanny filed a lawsuit for a couple's release, receiving a "racist" message.
In New York City, the nanny filed a suit against a couple for discriminating release after she had received an incorrectly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was another black.
The couple deny that they're racist, comparing the charge to "extortion."
Alice Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw the new nanny, Giselle Morris, who came on her first day of work in 2016, black.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Morris twice.
According to New York Post, aware of her mistake, Mrs. Plaxson-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and fired Miss Morris, and she claimed that their previous African-American nanny was not doing her job well and that instead she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Miss Morris was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now she's suing a couple, hoping to get paid for her salary, which she would have received in six months to live with the couple she was first hired for, although she had no contract, and she was to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them that you don't have to do that," she said to Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the charge that they were racists, the couple claimed that the release of Morris was a wise decision because they feared that they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," told Post her husband Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with the man you treated rudely, even if it wasn't deliberately?
Your baby?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Comparing the suit with "extortion," Plasco said his wife had a baby only two months ago and she hadn't been ready.
"Would you avenge anyone after that?
It's a bad thing," added an investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court has quickly condemned the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
According to the new letter, Padington’s publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking
Bond's daughter Karen Yankee, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to print, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the position of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know that the story of Padington is a huge success."
Telling that her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a child book, was optimistic about his being rejected, she shared, as on the 60th anniversary of the book's release, she felt "joy and sorrow" at the same time, because his father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family, ” Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was a rather modest man and didn't like to brag," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child!
I think that's how he looked at Padington's success.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say good - bye to the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the two Louis Pasteur hospitals in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"Nor a regular phone call, said it was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperus.
"And then the Over phoned me and said that she would die for the next two minutes and I should say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating gradually ceased to act and left her body.
She died some time before everything was shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn't mourn, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
She should have really held herself together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who had suffered the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, ignoring the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I dropped my head and couldn't hold back the tears.
This is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deep compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave their cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries leave on the Wallian bridge cards with telephone numbers that people can call for support, as well as messages to inspire them.
His son, Davis Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Sydney, told me that her son was a promising cook with a pretty smile.
"Everyone knew him for a smile.
They always said that smile made any room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died, because he was "just in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid it'll have consequences."
Mrs. Davis made the cards, "so that people know that there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't shut yourself up, you have to talk."
Miss Hamfries, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her 15 - year - old husband, Mark, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, depressed, depressed, or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas Day, he was completely discouraged, and when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to survive this: "It caused a devastating
I've got a family.
But we have to keep on living and fighting."

Britta Cavanaugh's future is in the middle of an investigation by the FBI.
"I thought that if we could get what we asked -- limited in the time and nature of the investigation -- we might have reached some agreement," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and added that he feared that the committee was breaking up in the face of the inevitable loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his press fans want the FBI to investigate?
Their failure is connected with time.
The mid-term elections will be held in just five weeks, November 6, if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously complicate their efforts to hold their own people in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush phoned the senators asking to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush's rule and who led him to meet his wife, Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, there will be a vote.
It is still unclear if Mr. Cavanaugh could get at least 50 votes at the Senate sitting, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and to approve his candidacy as Supreme Court Justice.
During the reign of Kima, the number of North Koreans was "short."
After Kim Chenn In came to power seven years ago, the number of North Koreans to South Korea was reduced by a South Korean lawgiver.
Park Pion Seug, referring to data from the Ministry of the United Republic of South Korea, stated that in the past year, the number of crossovers was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the key factors were the increased border control between North Korea and China, and that smugglers carrying illegals now demanded more money.
In Pyongyang, public comments were refrained.
The vast majority of North Koreans are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans were declared to have crossed the border illegally after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than the well-protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China views crossovers as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often is forced to rehearse them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still in a formal state of war, has improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issue of deuclarization, where negotiations on which had reached a dead end.
This took place after the June historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Cheng Yong in Singapore, where they agreed in general to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yon-Ho, in the background of the accepted replies, accused the United States of not progressing ever since.
"With no confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no one-sided disarmament," stated Ree Yon-Ho in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Britta Cavanaugh "historic" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the position of Justice of the Supreme Court, Britta Cavanaugh, "historic" and stated that he was at the same rate as the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've been thinking that if a woman ever performed this way, she'd be called "historic," "Peposy commented on her reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Juridical Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the charge of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introduction, Cavanaugh acted very emotionally, sometimes almost yelling and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him an "absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation," by the organized liberals, who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential elections in 2016.
According to Pelosi, Cavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed his prejudice toward the democratic people.
"I think that with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will take his own stand," she said.
Pelosi was indignant when asked if she would try to declare Cavanaugh’s impression if his guilt was confirmed, and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say, "If he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not only good for a job in the Supreme Court, but also the court where he works now," said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is currently serving as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the district of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions against the "On Accessible Medical Care" Act or the "Ro v. Wade" case, because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Cavanaugh passed the question of whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, biased person and we will say how wonderful it is," said Pelosi.
Women must possess this weapon.
These were just words that had accumulated months and years of anger, and she could not utter them without tears.
"We weep when we're angry," said Miss Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "One woman who was working as an executive director somewhere, and she really helped me, said that she also wept when she was angry, but she had her own technique, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to her talker, "You can think that I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
And I am evil."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are viewed as an acceptable way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my easiest memories of my first job in the office, where most of the men worked, was a situation where one day I wept from indescribable anger, and an older woman -- an unkind manager that I was always afraid of -- caught me by a cell and dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to get to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democracy congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught off-marriage on board a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, the deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a very deliberate decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate was the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation Snow White and Seven Dwarves.
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in the collection of funds, so she made a promise that she would not take part in the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her adherents, who had no regrets for men’s support of $1,000, were only $250.
"They think I'm going to get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave the talk and announced that she would not hold a formal campaign, she was emboldened by the gratitude of the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made the collection of money very difficult and forced her to be less selective than the members of the House of Representatives, and the anger of sexism, and she was ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Miss Schrader's reaction to the press.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
Did I still think about what they would write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How the U.S. - China trade war can benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and, although far from being over, Beijing can benefit from the long-term divisions between countries.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots early this year, taxing major Chinese exports, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
The worst situation this week was due to new product fares worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), which essentially taxes half of all goods that come to the United States from China.
Beijing paid back with the same coin every time, and he recently put a five-to-ten-per-cent token on American goods at 60 billion dollars.
China has committed itself to similar US measures, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to miss the opportunity to keep that promise soon.
To make Washington retreat means to accept the demands, but for China’s president, Xi Jingpin, U.S. public worship is too shameful.
However, experts believe that if Beijing takes proper advantage of the situation, the pressure in the U.S. trade war can bring China a long-term advantage by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic collapse in any country, and this is actually more dangerous than observers have recognized before," said an analyst named Abigail Grace, who deals with Asian-related issues at the Center for New American Security.
The Foreign Minister stated that Syria was “prepared ” for the return of the refugees.
In Syria, it is claimed that they are ready for the voluntary return of refugees and are seeking help in rebuilding a country devastated by war for over seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Secretary Walid al-Moualham stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"The real situation today has become more stable and secure because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
At present, all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have had to abandon because of terrorism, as well as one - side economic measures that have affected their daily lives and limited their means of living.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to accept help in restoring a war - torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or help from countries that supported the riot.
Europe fortifies winning the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Europe's team conquered the Ryder Cup in 2018 when the U.S. team won a total of 16.5:1.5 on Le Gulf National in suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time and has not won the Cup of Ryder tournament since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn gained 14.5 points they needed to win the victory over the United States.
The American star Phil Michelson, who worked hard for most of the tournament, hit his first long shot on the 16th hole of steam-3 into the water and gave in to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his games and became one of the four players who had ever gone through a score of between 5 and 0 and 0 since the start of the tournament in modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost a score of 5:4 from the lowest score player in the European team Turbburn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world's rating, gave up on account 2:1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in the last time in the Ryder Cup tournament.
The Spanishman, Serchio Josiah, who had already participated eight times in the tournament, became a European who had won the most tournaments all the time, bringing 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, so happy to return the cup.
It's the merit of the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," said, without controlling the emotions, garcia after winning Europe.
He passes the escapade to his countryman John Reem, who on Sunday defeated the American golf legend of Tiger Woods in a single game with a score of 2:1.
"I feel incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four games and now has a career record for the Ryder Cup 13 - 21 - 3.
Strange statistics for one of the most famous players of all time who won 14 Major tournaments, only to Jack Niclaws.
The U.S. Congregation tried to reach the fairway during all weekends, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed high-end golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said about his team after the discomfort, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we briefly dominated Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the U.S. professional golf player association and the Ryder Cup tournament committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We must not overlook them.
We lost."
Red tide information: decrease in concentration in Pinellas, Manat, and Sarasota
The latest report to the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife shows a general decline in red - color microorganisms in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to Florida’s commission on fish and wildlife, conditions of abundant flowering, reported in certain regions of Pinellas, Manata, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier, indicate a decline in concentration.
The bloom of red microorganisms stretches some 130 miles from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but less than last week.
The red tide was also seen in the district of Pasco.
Last week, an average concentration was reported in the region of Pinellas and its coastal zone, a concentration from low to high in the coastal zone of Hillsborough, a high concentration in Manat, a high concentration in Sarastot and its coastal area, a middle concentration in Charlotte, a high concentration in Leigh and its coastal area, and a low concentration in Collier.
