"Since Agustina, it was unprofessional."
"Then you have to show the pope, not the show, channel 1."
"I mean, there was a chance for someone, and he had a chance for someone.
And I'm not, I'm the voiceless pope, and I have more than a voice with a voice.
Surgut's voice and trumpet, and Pope Agustina's been led to it?
And then we'll all regret that we've got the same faces!
It's because you can't get out of the chimney."
"Why are you doing this?
That's right!
It's all blue and cumulating.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
