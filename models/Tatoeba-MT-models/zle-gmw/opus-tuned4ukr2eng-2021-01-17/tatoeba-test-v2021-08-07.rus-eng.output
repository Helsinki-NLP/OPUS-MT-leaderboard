I'm teaching the Dutch language.
I'm bringing Tom to the church.
I'm doing it.
That's a good idea.
That's not what happened.
It's you.
Thank you for everything.
It's so bad that we didn't react.
It's so bad that we didn't react.
It's so bad that we didn't react.
Three years like that.
It's getting warmer.
It's been a long time since the heat was so hot.
That's what I started doing.
I, the clericalist, was king of Paris.
I'm thinking all about it.
I've been thinking about them all day.
I knew he was right.
I think he's a species.
I think he's hungry.
I think he wants to.
I think he's worthy of dignity.
I believe him.
I think I can do that.
I think I could do that.
I think I've got you.
I think I'm taking what you're doing.
To me, I'm like somebody else's office.
I've been looking for someone to call me.
I've heard someone call me.
To me, I'm like somebody else's office.
I heard something falling.
I think I'm going to go after him.
I know what's going to happen.
I know what I'm doing.
I know what that is.
I think I'm doing it.
I think I'm coming from a beer bar.
I guess I'm gonna kill you.
I'm losing days.
I think I appreciate it.
I think I've had a good time.
I think I'm the one who's got it.
I don't think I'm doing it, I think.
I think it's good to be good.
I think he's got it.
It's a fox, not a dog.
He's gone.
She's a motherfuckin' girl.
I think you're doing well.
I think I've got my job.
I've got to get some lessons.
I think it's time to go.
I think that's Tom.
I think it's big for you.
She's big for you.
It's big for you.
It's great for you.
It's big for you.
He's big for you.
I think it was your fault.
I told you that.
I told you that.
I've already told you that.
I've already told you that.
I don't think I've seen them.
Mary's the girl.
I think it's my name.
I think she's a dancer.
I think she's hungry.
I think she wants to.
I think she's tired.
I'm sorry, Dad's gonna make me sick.
I cough, I cough, I cough, and I have a blood vessel in my butterfly.
I know what you're doing.
I know how you're being treated.
I think I'm the one who's got it.
I told you that.
I told you that.
I've already told you that.
I've already told you that.
I don't think I've seen them.
I think the car's already broken.
Mary's the girl.
I think it's my name.
It's kind of like that.
I think they have kids.
It's not going to happen.
I think Tom's got it.
I think Tom's gone.
I think Tom's right.
Tom's a schizophrenic.
I think that's Tom's.
I think Tom got me.
I think Tom's gonna change.
I think Tom wants to.
I think that's why I'm here.
I think we're putting our names together.
I think that would have been the case.
I'm sorry, you paid a lot for this.
There's a trial.
I think they did.
I think you're too small.
I think you're too small.
I think you're too small.
I think you're too small.
I think they did.
You've got a lot of money.
You've got a lot of money.
I think that's what I'm offering you.
That's the place Tom's going to go.
I guess he's right, Tom, but I'm not.
I think Tom can do it.
I thought Tom found out.
I think Tom is.
Tom didn't think so.
I think Tom was crying.
I think Tom's depressed.
Tom's a cat.
I think Tom's squeaky.
In a way, Tom.
I think Tom's lying.
I think Tom's right.
Tom's a schizophrenic.
I think Tom's still in Boston.
I think Tom's out of touch.
I think that's why they're less than that.
I think Tom is older than you are.
I think Tom is older than you are.
I think Tom's gonna change.
Tom's good.
I think Tom got me.
I think Tom had to stay in Boston.
I think Tom is.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
I think Tom was glad he didn't get it.
I think I've got Tom.
I think Tom's gonna buy a beer.
I think Tom will be happy to take you.
I think Tom took it.
I think we've got those.
I think we do.
I think we're gonna be fine.
I think we're doing it.
I think we've got them on the job.
I think we're going to send the guy we're going to take.
I don't think we should have done it.
I think we should tell Tom that we're not going to do much more than that.
I think you could have done that.
I think you're welcome.
I think you've done some business.
I think you did it.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
I think you're welcome to me.
I think you're getting a loan.
I think you're good.
I think you should eat more.
I think you've had a hard time.
I think you've got it.
I think you're going to have a hard time.
I think we can trust you.
I'm assuming you're sitting on the office.
I knew I was in charge.
I think you've got it.
I don't think you're allowed to tell Tom the truth.
I think you should talk to them.
I think you love Tom all the time.
You seem to have misunderstood.
I think you were wrong.
I was thinking about him.
I thought he was doing it alone.
I thought I could do it to her.
I thought I could help him.
I thought I'd find Tom there.
I've got a key for you.
I thought I had the whole thing.
I'm very clear.
I thought it was time for us to leave.
I thought it would be easier.
I thought it would make her happy.
I thought she was just a fine and a fine, but the police ordered her to do it.
I thought he was.
I thought it was Tom's.
I thought Tom was leaving.
I thought Tom was married.
I thought Tom was staying in Boston.
I thought it was you.
I thought we were friends.
I thought you'd tell Tom he was doing it.
I thought you'd let Tom know he was doing it.
I thought you were going to a concert with us.
I thought you were with me.
I thought you loved Tom.
I thought you'd do that.
You said it was yours.
I thought you were Canadian.
I thought you were.
I thought it was Tom's gun.
I thought there was someone in there.
I thought I was wrong.
I thought they weren't coming.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I thought Tom and Maria weren't doing it anymore.
I thought Tom didn't have a car.
I thought it was Tom's.
I thought Tom hadn't been to Boston.
I thought Tom hated Mary.
I thought Tom was leaving.
I thought Tom was Mary.
Tom said Mary was in the hospital.
I thought Tom was awake.
I thought Tom was incredible.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I thought Tom was your friend.
I thought Tom was your husband.
I thought Tom would be in me.
I thought Tom would be there and not.
I thought Tom was going to be there.
I thought Tom was coming to see us.
I thought Tom was into it.
I thought we'd done it.
I thought we'd be in the hospital.
I thought we'd talked about that before.
I thought you'd agree with me.
I thought you were busy.
I thought you'd be interested to know that Tom had a job.
I thought you guys were coming.
I thought you were asleep.
I thought you took someone.
I thought you didn't know that.
I thought you didn't.
I thought you'd be there.
I thought you wouldn't ask.
I thought you'd tell Tom he was doing it.
I thought you'd let Tom know he was doing it.
I thought you'd check it out.
I thought you should go.
I thought you were taking her.
I thought you had him.
I thought you hated us.
I thought you had them.
I thought you were with me.
You said it was coming.
You told me Tom was coming to you.
You said I did it.
I thought you stopped with him.
I thought you weren't with him anymore.
I thought you were a ghost.
I thought you were on your way.
I thought you were on your way.
I thought you were here.
I thought you were.
I thought Boston didn't take you.
I blew it.
That's right.
It's not normal to have a right hand.
It's a cat.
The perspective is depressing.
It's a lot of fun, you seashells on the beach.
Paycheck.
This rough road leads to the peaks of greatness.
It's a hard way to go to the tops of greatness.
It's as warm as it is.
That's obviously true.
It's on the road.
Swimming with dolphins.
Foreigners are hard to get used to.
It's hard for me to deal with the problem.
Smooth and grind.
That's what I'm teaching you.
Teaching is important.
It's all right.
It's that I'm going to France, I just don't know.
It's like putting a needle in a haystack.
You've got it and you've got it.
It's a shame to take someone over who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who'
It's not mine.
I'm going to get the airlock out.
You can't say that sports are sports.
Loving someone isn't like that.
It's not easy, but it is.
It's not okay.
So much isn't normal.
It's disrespectful, he's talking.
It's not that expensive.
It's not that expensive.
It's not that expensive.
Tom couldn't be saved.
You're not coming back.
It's often that you're in the middle of a church.
We've done it.
It's inconvenient that a scientist of this kind would have been a federal authority.
I'm sure Anne's theirs.
His son died in a foreign home.
By the end of the day, Magnus Carlsen had reached 2882.
Outside.
It's time for you to go to bed.
You've got to go to bed.
I'm sure he's alive.
It's hot in here.
It's hot.
It's windy.
"It's written: Hank will defeat Gannon by wearing a rose." (He waved the palate.) "How am I doing?" "I'm a faggot."
You're the one who's not!
It won't let me sleep at night.
It'll be cold tonight.
It's gonna be dark tonight.
Now we don't go to Tom's house.
By the way, as soon as I get there, there's gonna be a chance.
She'll be ready right away.
He'll be ready right away.
It will be ready directly.
It'll be warmer.
It's winter soon.
He's broken.
We'll be on the road.
It's gonna be okay, don't worry!
It'll take you a minute.
You've got three hours to do that.
It seemed like he was taking me.
He's got it.
Looks like something's coming up.
Looks like she's been killed.
Looks like Tom's taking care of it.
Looks like Tom's still there.
It makes me so angry!
I don't care if Tom comes or not.
I don't care if you're wearing a suit.
It doesn't matter whether you are or not.
It's not easy.
It's the end of the day.
That was expensive.
That's what I'm doing.
In summer, we often go to bed.
I'm making a joke.
I told her it was.
I told her I didn't.
I told her not to.
I told him, but he didn't understand.
I told him that, but he didn't understand.
I told him I changed my mind.
I told him what I was doing.
I told him I didn't.
I told him to go to the hospital.
I told Mary I'd go to Boston with her.
I told them not to.
I told them they didn't talk.
I told them it's the same thing.
I told them the bank didn't go.
I told them I was in the shoes.
I told Tom a joke, but he didn't laugh.
I'm telling Tom that we're doing it.
I told Tom everything I knew about it.
I told Tom everything I knew about it.
I told Tom he'd talk to a lawyer.
I told Tom I'd be there.
I told Tom that Mary needed it.
I told Tom I'd be there.
I told Tom that I wouldn't take him.
I told Tom you were going to Australia.
I told Tom he was coming.
I told Tom he took me.
I sent Tom back.
I told Tom he took him to Australia.
I told Tom to take me.
I told Tom what I needed to do.
I told Tom you were going to Australia.
I told Tom that you were here.
I told Tom you were hungry.
I told you everything that was done.
I told you I'd do it.
I told you I changed my mind.
I told you I didn't know Tom.
I told you that I'm the whole thing.
I told you you didn't call me anymore.
I told you it was.
I told you to go to the hospital.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
I told you Tom was busy.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to leave.
I told you to go to the hospital.
I told you we were coming.
I told you to come over.
That was the first time.
It took Tom just a few minutes.
Tom's got it for minutes.
And I get angry too.
I'm worried about them, too.
I took it for a joke and I didn't do it.
I took my shoes off and you put them in the hospital.
I took my umbrella out of fear.
I've made the insurance policy.
I took two aspirin pills from my headache.
I took my keys.
I took my keys.
I took your keys.
I took my keys.
I'm with her.
I knew it was Mary's day.
It's not a solid person.
It's been raining for three days.
It's been a flood all day.
It's been pouring all morning.
I'm talking about it.
It's been raining for three days.
I've been making a fuss about the problem.
I've done it, I've done it to Tom.
I did it, but I didn't succeed.
I got you.
I got Tom.
It's gone under the couch.
It's a sunset under the couch.
It's gone under the couch.
I'm here for you.
I'm trying not to make it later.
I'm trying not to go to school.
I'm trying not to look after them.
I'm trying not to go to school.
I'm trying not to look after them.
I try to put at least one apple a day.
I try to have a healthy image of myself.
I'm trying to keep an image of a person.
It's a stupid thing to do with her.
It's an experience.
Home, one problem is the box.
It's a job.
It's an early drink, isn't it?
We've got to go to the hospital.
I've got to go.
That's a real name.
It's an ugly thing that's not immune to the fire.
That argument is old as peace.
It's a dictatorship.
It's not a bug, it's a fig.
It's a place.
I didn't.
That's a real name.
For poor Tom, it's done.
That's all about it.
It's spring.
That's the best part.
It's been ten hours, my mother is mad.
It's so quiet, it's so quiet.
It's a miracle that Tom's in the office.
It's a miracle that Tom's in the office.
It's real.
It's a truce.
It's a good thing.
It's a book.
It's a good language.
It's a good idea.
It's in the house.
That's my friend.
That's my friend.
It's normal.
Too bad Tom doesn't have a girlfriend.
I'm sorry I got someone.
It's a hare, but he can walk on his paws.
It's a hare, but he's walking on his paws.
It's a risk we can't take.
It's a sad experience.
Yes, sir.
It's a secret, so don't tell me.
It's a secret, so don't tell me.
It's a secret, so don't tell me.
It's a secret, so don't tell me.
It's in the first place.
That's what I'd like.
It's a roller coaster.
It's as warm as it is.
That's a good idea.
It's a terrible thing.
It's a very specific letter.
It's gone.
It's wildly cold.
I came because I was asked to come.
It's because of you, I'm out of here.
It's getting cold.
It's getting hot.
It was a good day.
It was my night.
It was a very busy day.
That's what happened with the memory of the times.
More than that.
Tom's got that year.
It's been ten years since I died.
It's been three years since I drove the car the last time.
It's been three years since I drove twice.
It's been three years since I was the last time.
It's been three years since Tom died.
It's been three days.
Clearly, Tom wasn't there.
It's cold in my cold.
It's cold in the cold.
It's cold in the kitchen.
It's cold outside.
The darkness is imperceptible.
It's a good morning, isn't it?
There's a lake floating in the lake.
It's boring.
A goal with its hands. A rabbit.
It's hard to deal with Tom.
It's easier than you do.
He's in charge.
It's easy for rich people to get richer.
It's easy to get richer.
It's easy to make it.
I'm surprised.
Looks like Tom didn't have a job.
Looks like he was poor when he was young.
Her wife's a lawyer.
I'm glad I know you all over the place.
Looks like Tom wants a teacher.
You've done a lot of work.
You look like you've been doing a lot of work.
You've done a lot of work.
You look like you've been doing a lot of work.
It's empty.
Choose it yourself.
It's expensive.
Let's get on the car.
It's for a friend of yours.
It's growing.
It's bigger.
It's something.
It's good that there's no Tom.
Good thing Tom isn't here.
It's good to see Tom.
That's a lot of stuff, isn't it?
He's pretty good.
Half a third.
It's hard for me to get inside.
It's hard for me to drive.
It's a girl.
It's hard. It's like a man, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman.
He's a fool. He's a fool.
Clothing is hard to find.
It's hard to say.
It's hard to get in.
She's gone.
It's his day at school.
It's hot here.
We've been right there.
You're the one.
I'm not in you.
Your actions are incompatible!
You know what tomorrow is.
Your actions are incompatible!
It's interesting.
It's interesting.
It's in the attic.
It's in the attic.
It's in the attic.
It's a fairy tale.
It's a fairy tale.
It's just a picture that I downloaded in France.
It's just a whirlwind, not a poetic poem.
That's the way it works.
She's so good.
That's how it works.
He's so good at it.
That's the way to go!
It's a lot more fun of birds than it is of an alarm clock.
There are laws.
It's good to be home.
It's not about that.
It's not a bug.
Underneath the parking lot is the car.
It's not like you did.
It's not as hot as I am.
That's the point.
It's not cold.
That's not true.
It's not easy.
It's not easy to be a member.
It's not easy to love someone like Tom.
It's not easy to love someone like Tom.
Tom's love isn't easy.
It's not legal.
It's not expensive.
It's not hopeless.
It's not deadly.
It's not fatal.
You mean, it's not fun.
It won't be as hard as you do.
It's not good, it's good.
I'm sorry.
It's not on the table.
It's not me, I swear!
It's not my fault I take them all.
It's not okay.
So much isn't normal.
All right, just live and be happy.
It's not that expensive.
It's not that expensive.
It's not a god of science.
He's proud.
It's not that expensive.
It's not the one she wears.
Tom couldn't be saved.
You're not coming back.
That's not true.
In the countryside, it's not like you're going to be a wrestler.
There's a wolf's-eye in it.
I'm not.
It's absolutely impossible that you're taking me, that I believe in what you don't believe!
We've lost our lives.
It was snowing all night.
It's been snowing all night.
Something's going to change.
I've already had something to change.
Tom obviously didn't.
I'm sorry.
It's one of the most beautiful places in the world.
It's been three hours.
It'll be too bad now.
That's all I have to say.
We've got to go.
Sounds simple.
Sounds simple.
Tom was young.
They're eating rice and beans.
It's obvious that you love the language.
It rains like a bucket.
He's coming.
We're in Boston.
He's coming.
It's red.
Tell him he won't be invited soon.
It's just obvious.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
That's so cool!
It's so quiet.
It's a commercial.
For now, there's a lot of ads.
It's early, and we're talking about it.
It's a stupid thing to do.
It's summer in Paris.
It's tea.
It's hot this morning.
It's good for you.
It's a journey in the world.
Take them.
It's a ride.
It's a match in the world.
I'm still going.
It's time for a nap.
It's time for you to go to bed.
It's time for something to do with it.
Somehow I've got a problem.
It's time for lunch!
It's time.
It's time to teach.
It's time to teach.
It's time to teach the language.
It's time to go to bed.
I've got it.
It's time to go.
It's time to go.
You should go to the hairdresser's.
It's time.
It's hard.
That's good for me.
We're early in the morning.
It's too early for us.
It's easy.
She's crazy, I can't take her.
He's crazy, I can't take him.
It's hot on the road.
It's hot outside.
She was small to me.
He's not my kid.
It's not enough for me.
He's a little kid.
It's unnatural.
It's not cold in the season.
It's cold.
That's a big deal.
That's my dearest.
Lives are expensive.
It's very rude to insult someone in the office.
You're the one.
I'll try.
It's written in Croatian.
It's written in Croatian.
It's written in Niderlad.
It's written in a non-derladian way.
You did it, not me.
You're the one who blamed it.
You're the one who's making it happen.
Now it's yours.
It's yours now.
It's yours now.
It's yours now.
Now it's coming.
It's yours now.
Now it's yours.
Now it's done.
It's okay.
It's your turn, Bashar!
Now you.
Dad was carrying the load.
I can't break up in the morning.
It took about three years to get home.
Tom didn't.
It took about three years to get home.
It literally took a little more than an hour.
I've had a lot of trouble getting used to it.
I didn't take them.
I've got it, I've got it.
It took me three years to get home.
It took about three years to get home.
It caught us by surprise.
I'm sorry.
I turned right.
I turned on the fan.
I've turned over the books.
He was a good man.
It was a fantastic day.
It was a hard fight.
It was a hero.
That was a good thing.
It was noon.
That's how it happened.
That was a good idea.
It was easy.
That was a good one.
It was a refuge.
It was a place of refuge.
It was a strange story.
It was a typo.
It was a romantic experience.
The case was very difficult.
It was a warm, warm day.
It was a loss.
It was a strange thing.
It was hot.
That's what I wanted to do.
I wanted to take her because I loved her.
It was cold.
I was mad at you in the storm.
He was dark green.
It was dark green.
It was Tom and Mary.
It was for Tom, not for you.
It was for Tom, not for you.
It was fun.
It's good you don't go.
It's good you didn't go.
It's good you're not coming.
It's good you don't go.
It's good you don't go.
It's good you didn't go.
It's good you're not coming.
It's good you don't go.
It was hard.
It was in the hospital.
It was just water.
It's the night before.
It's my book that you've been breaking to pieces.
That was my plan.
It was not my king who was chessed, but none of my men were able to move, so it was what the "devastated king" or the "deathed king" or the "attraction of the Utopian." The match ended in nothing.
That wasn't me.
That wasn't really the case.
It wasn't him.
I didn't translate it.
It's not much fun.
That was the best I could do.
It was our experience.
Tom's gone home, she's gone to bed.
Tom's going home for the night.
It was real.
It was quiet.
It was quiet everywhere.
It was a place of refuge.
She's on her way, but she's on her way.
There was a hospital in Boston.
It was so dark that I could feel it.
I didn't get up early.
It was lasanya, Tom or anything.
It was lasanya, Tom or anything.
That's why I'm in the head.
