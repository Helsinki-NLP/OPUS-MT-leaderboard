Tom wants to join the team.
You're too thin.
Come here.
There's a map on the wall.
You're very handsome.
I came to see you.
What's your favorite pizza stuff?
The latter view has many Japanese adherents.
You don't think you could do that?
I don't know what I can do for you.
Tom's smart.
He's annoying.
If you go, I'll miss you.
Point the wise man to a mistake, and he'll thank you, point the stupid one to a mistake, and he'll hurt you.
That's a great idea.
I don't think there's anything in there.
Make your point clear.
They don't know us.
Tom probably forgot to tell Mary about it.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
I'll invite Tom to dinner.
Maybe I'll do it again.

It's an orange.
He's an atheist.
What's your aunt doing?
I played with the champion.

In truth, I disagree with you.
Mary said she believed it.
When are you leaving?
I have a lot of friends.
I wish I could stay here forever.
She always has time after dinner.
The land covers a smaller part of the earth’s surface.
I have a twin.
We begged Tom not to go there.
I think we may have been too aggressive.
You're big.
I have some free time.
I'll help you tomorrow.
This story entertained me.
Watch your head!
I'll miss you.
Take this.
Tom asked you to do something?
Tom's dog's name is Cookie.
I just changed the password.
I didn't do anything like that.

Anybody here?
Don't call me.
It's better to die standing than to live on your knees.
Tom's waiting.
Everybody likes Tom.
I knew you'd wait for us.
I can't forget her.
They have chosen a new government.
Please wait five minutes.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Bring me a clean plate and take the dirty plate.
Tom told me he was alone.
This is the church we were married to.
I don't think Tom will be gone.
I think that makes sense.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.

It was built forever.
He passed the exam.
Whose friend are you?
Tom's too tired to study.
Tom threw Mary's ball.
Tom's pretty persuasive, isn't he?
I miss talking to them.
He tried not to cry.

Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Who told you I did it?
It's never too late.

You're Italian.
What's she like?
The pocket thief pulled Mark's passport.
I think you like him.
This magazine costs only two pounds, including shipping.
I'll miss you.
I sat on the bench next to Tom.
They love each other.
Come tomorrow.
What insects did you eat?
I saw Tom hit by a car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees it.
I got on the wrong bus.
I gave up that offer.
Mary had already done what she had to do.
I was watching Tom.
Have you reserved a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about going to the picnic.
We could not buy concert tickets until we received money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe another time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.
Tom doesn't play tennis very well.
I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
You're needed by Tom here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People living in a place cannot get the satisfaction of living in a village.
Mary has good eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a cola and a frie potatoes.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly accepted.
I think Tom is wrong.
You all right?
Maybe you're the only one who can do that.
Who doesn't have a radio?
Your singing makes professional singers feel ashamed.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom's down.
It was big.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary.
Esther's a lesbian.
I was bitten by a dog last week.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely that Tom will forget how it's done.
Drinking?
Will Tom do it with you?
Are you awake?
The meeting began at 5:00 p.m.
Mary said she liked doing it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I've only been to Tokyo once.
I got the electricity bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do that.
All members must be present.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning to do this with?
We are happy with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
He'll find out.
A Witness who has seen everything in his own eyes is worth more than ten who have heard it.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
It's over with Tom.
When I entered the room, she played the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom pulled out his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you where the party is?
Mary's tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
It filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll eat it.
I don't want any more.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom will be here today.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, I'd love to!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
It's spring soon.
It speaks in two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning on staying for a while?
When do you plan to go to Japan?
My kids are in school.
I put my suitcase in.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking about you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant bucket.
Saturate the wound with salt.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom is younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom's very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat lunch.
I'm not blaming anyone.
The plane took off at 9:00 sharp.
Tom speaks French quite freely.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom wiped himself with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I have a lot of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait for the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
Next month Tom leaves Boston.
It's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Millions of people starve to death each year.
I was wondering what Tom wanted.
There was a wrong address on the letter.
This is the last train.
Who's going to fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all chocolate.
They went to another religion.
I need to be more careful.
I downloaded them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What is he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever gonna do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I just cut my hair.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
It's our fault.
You're so cute.
It's going to be about fifteen dollars.
I blew the door.
His theory is noteworthy.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis girl.
So Tom became famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You sang.
I did it perfectly.
I like writing.
Kioto is an outstandingly beautiful city.
The next month, I'm sixteen.
Do you think there's a probability that this will happen?
Accept your dreams.
At what hour will your final lesson end?
I came to say goodbye, Tom.
I like that dog.
I tried to contact her.
What's she got?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing this.
We have to help Tom.
It rained all day.
I was upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You need to stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines in the morning and the moon in the night.
I got a kick on her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom can help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I have a problem with the boss.
It's a banana.
Thomas will probably be punished for what he did.
Is Mary your girlfriend?
London was filled with fog.
I'm really glad you're here, Tom.
Tom's weak.
I told him to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you'll win.
She went to the airport to guide him.
Step aside.
He's in the kitchen.
Please don't be angry.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
Brazil’s capital, Brasília
What I really want is to sleep.
I still have to pay the phone bill.
Tom knows how to cook.
But the music makes him nervous.
What languages are spoken in America?
You deserve a rest.
These are fresh.
Tom's eyes are huge.
The rainbow has seven colors.
I think that's why we shouldn't do this.
He's gloomy today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his frank opinion.
Aren't you on your turn tonight?
Tom never had to learn too much.
How's your wife, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has many friends.
That would be unfair.
You have to go there, either you or Jane.
If I were you, I'd ignore it.
Tom will be here right now.
These are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
That's a Greek name.
You think I'm joking?
I was very tired today.
I'm true.
Happiness is not the possession of many things.
News spread throughout Japan.
Tom showed you the side of the mountain.
The taxi's here.
I heard him come down the stairs.
That's mine.
How strange!
Can you read Cyrillic?
I know Tom quite well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom's neat, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such an asshole.
Tom gave you something for me?
I could never have done that without your help.
I always have coffee and cakes for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I haven't had breakfast.
I'm the best.
How was your exam?
Can I pay you later?
Did that just happen?
Mary didn't take the umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
In truth, I lied.
I'm going to bed!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did it.
They're all tourists.
Can you lend me a pint?
It's your life.
Tom said he was thirsty.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't.
Patrick doesn't know how to write.
I was too ashamed.
I'm getting deeper into the details.
Tom said he didn't want to do it.
Let's go to the oceanroom.
Do you know what causes the problem?
Where's Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry, she doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
I have a good appetite today.
We're comfortable in our new house.
There are only two infinite things in the world, the universe and human folly, and I can't be sure about the first.
She said, "I'm very happy."
It's interesting to talk to Tom.
You reap what you sow.
What are you looking at?
Can't we go faster?
We're not just football players.
All the meat's ruined.
I was born that way.
Tom and I were racing.
He came home late in the evening.
The U.K. National Health Service has updated the coronavirus recommendations today.
Grab the rope.
Tom and I drink the same thing.
He could not resist the desire to smoke another cigarette.
There's a secret passage.
I don't want to argue with you.
Let me in.
She's unconscious.
I thought Tom wouldn't do that.
I love you.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom was a little confused.
He signed the check.
Hey, how you doing?
The password is Muiriel.
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads novels.
Take the trash out.
You're my friend.
He's got two cars.
They realized it.
No problem!
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
May I borrow your scissors?
Thank her for her help.
Tom confirmed that no one was hurt.
She slept with 25 men overnight and then killed them.
They went to the zoo.
I was shy.
They're not rich.
Take my hand, we'll build a utopia together.
Tom said Mary was confused.
One of them is lying.
Harvard was founded in 1636.
Do you really want to go to Boston alone?
It's hot tonight.
God gave, God gave, and took.
How far is Boston from here?
I laughed at his joke.
My father may be asleep.
What's the best way to learn French?
I'm a bureaucrat.
I was born on October 10, 1972.
I was able to solve the problem.
I'm sure he can afford it.
Do you drink alcoholic beverages?
My parents fight again.
I like chess.
Mary is a blonde.
It's in my pocket.
She speaks English well.
Tom's just kidding.
We have a great team.
My name was at the top of the list.
I doubt what she said.
Tom has a piano.
What do you do about it?
I meet her demands.
Forget about this sad event.
Please take this away.
Nobody likes to lose.
I think that's why you're gonna love it.
I go to the library at least once a week.
I want some coffee.
How did you learn French?
We already know you did.
The blade is thrown out.
Tom bakes cookies on Sundays.
Did you ask Tom?
Thanks to God, everyone was fine.
We're the perfect couple.
Fadl's talking too much.
That's what you really need to do.

I did it, too.
What will you do tomorrow?
This is my wife, Edith.
This student is an American.
Gray cloud.
No one has seen us.
I'll wait here.
As a youth, she lived in a suburb of Tokyo.
Does any of this matter?
That's my email.
Tom will do it if you pay him for it.

It's Valentine's Day.
It's not clear what I'm supposed to do.
Tom's keeping the diary.
Tell me the truth, please.
We ordered too much food.
I'm not a student.
I'm late for school.
I couldn't solve the problem.
We don't have time.
Just pretend I'm a stranger.
She's much better.
Do you know any other solutions?
In other words, he's lazy.
I took advantage of the opportunity to visit the museum.
Tom and Mary avoid John.
My memory's gone.
Tom loves Mary very much.
Tom's cooking dinner.
The dog himself is smart.
I can't remove the photos from the camera!
I was amazed to know that I had won.
I wonder if Tom told Mary she had to do it.
All dogs are animals, but that doesn't mean that all animals are dogs.
Those who can conceive of only one way to write a word may lack imagination.
I'm sure he's successful.
Tom didn't do it.
Where's the nearest subway station?
Tom ran through the window.
You're not hiding anything?
How are you?
I didn't know it was going to happen.
I have a lot of friends.
You can do it right now.
No speed limit.
Tom's a little red.
That's what you're supposed to do.
I should probably spend some time with Tom.
Do you know how to drive?
How did you know this would happen?
I forgot his name.
What's your favorite number?

I thought it was a good idea.

It's an avalanche.
You said it was important.
Can you help me?
Tom said he hoped Mary could win.
I think they're students.
I'm just saying you did well with your job.
I think you've said enough.
I'm a client.
I'm very greedy.
You're crazy.
Tom won't bother Mary anymore.
Answer me right now.
I thought Tom was missing home.
Tom hasn't done that since last year.
You're done complaining?
Aren't you Mary's husband?
Do they speak English?
No one's seen Tom.
The police continued their investigation.
I think I know what Tom would do.
Tom said he was very busy.
What will you do today?
I love this game.
How's Emily?
We don't care.
We do what we have to do.

Tom suggested that Mary learn harder.
I'm a little hungry.
I'm pregnant.
Everyone's happy.
I've had dinner.
Am I distracting you?
I looked at the menu.
Tom doesn't like public speaking.
Tell me you're eating, and I'll tell you who you are.
I like tennis more than football.
Tom's true.
I love learning languages.
Are you her pimp?
Please stay here.
Why would I do that for Tom?
My sister looks like our mother.
Why don't you worry?
Mars has two months.
It's extremely dangerous.
It's a dry tree.
Would you like to come with me to the beach?
I think I could do it better.
Give me the whiskers.
He imagined himself to be a genius.
Tom's a little late.
I like that shirt.
But suddenly he felt dizzy and sat back in his old chair.
Tom's actually married to Mary?
Do you still have it?
Do you like juice?
I knew they'd suspect her.
He jumped over the puddle.
Don't die, please!
Who won?
What are some of the arguments you can pervert to help us?
Would they do that?
I have to help him, he's my friend.
Are you ready for the exam?
All your friends will be there.
It's Tom's fault.
I would have done it if you hadn't stopped me.
You are the problem.
I know math very well.
Don't worry about it!
I thought Tom had a good plan.
This door won't open.
She speaks Chinese.
Your presence here means a lot to me.
Slowly, please.
Let's make a cake.
We are satisfied with the decision.
Did you and Tom fight?
I saw him last week.
Who did Tom go to the store with?
Go home from behind.
I can't whistle.
That's how I cook the fish.
Where did you get it?
There's a probability that a man was killed.
They're my sisters.
They were attacked.
He just arrived.
I love movies.
We all want something.
Students like it.
I don't know who I should talk to.
She likes animals.
I need to go talk to the boss.
Open your suitcase.
She lived a happy life.
He's from Genoa.
Which bag is yours?
Do you remember how this film ends?
She rebuked him for breaking his promise.
Tom will see you.
I've got plans.
His signature was on the document.
Why does it matter now?
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Don't worry, I'll do it.
I have a few ideas.
But no one could help me.
I'm tired of a long walk.
She was afraid of her own shadow.
You're not like the others.
I'm innocent.
Did you go outside last night?
I was too weak to get out of bed.
What's your favorite food?
Excuse me, who are you?
You'll never be alone.
Why would Tom want to do that if he doesn't have to?
You don't have to call me.
It's time to go home.
Try to understand.
Of course, plasosaurs could swim.
Tom made me come here.
I made spaghetti.
My son is taller than I am.
Did you know Tom used to live in Boston?
Nothing else scares me.
Tom's sick.
They're friends of Tom's.
I'm used to working hard.
This program has an intuitive user interface.

He was too sleepy to read the evening paper.
It's all chocolate.
The earth is covered with forests.
Aren't you going to do it again?
I'm sorry I ruined your wedding.
I need you on my team.
Tom doesn't want to wait in line.
I'm confused.
In popular culture, the phrase "Acbar" has become almost synonymous with terrorism.
I'm very hungry.
I ate your city in my mouth and ass.
Perhaps you will meet him.
It's my fault, not yours.
Tom may have had a broken car.
Don't panic!
It's very loud here.
I hope you're not afraid.
I thought it was true.
Tom may have borrowed the money he needed from someone else.
Can you just do it now?
Why did you do that?
I'm a foreigner.
They saw me.
Tom has a bright future.
I don't know how to thank you.
There's no air on the moon.
We want to have a good time, too.

Very unlikely that Tom would ever do it again.
The plan's working.
I don't need a job.
I'm just a girl.
Tom was extremely angry.
I'd like to live in Boston.
Aren't you mad at Tom?
I think you should ignore Tom's line.
You look preoccupied.
You don't have to tell me how to do this.
We've been together for a long time.
That's what we think.
I didn't forget.
I like your shirt.
What beautiful candy they are!
Keep your promises.
I'm dining at four o'clock in the seventh.
We can't deny that he didn't.
For personal reasons.

No one called us.
It's not time to eat.
The fire caused panic in the theater.
But I don't have any money.

I don't have time to help you with your job.
I sent a text message to Tom.
School starts at 9:00 p.m.
Tom waited for Mary to go to bed.
Tom doesn't want to be in charge.
It's not worth the effort.
Tom still thinks Mary lied?
I don't like the smell of garlic.
The reasoning is simple.
I'm not paid as much as I'd like.
I'm sorry, but I can't have dinner with you.
Unceasing noise choked us.
Am I fired?

Let's check it out.

I'm sorry I can't leave.
I was fast-reading.
He went to the store.
I hit him skillfully and severely.
I'd like to know why you did that.
Where's the toilet?
Let me help you with your luggage.
I have to find Tom.
How can I help you?
I like your hair.
Put the book back in the book closet.
We just got here.
I just got bit by a mosquito.
Do you like that wallet?
Are you still allowing that to happen?
Tom's waiting for an answer.
Will Tom and Mary come to the party?
Call him, please.
It's a small house, but it'll suit us.
You can answer questions.

They're not yours, are they?
Mom's playing tennis now.
Who do you live with?
When I returned, my car was gone.
Tom doesn't think he can do it on his own.

I was lost in the maze.
The girl standing there is Mary.
Don't admit anything.

It's not our only problem.
Ignore them.
Are you going to the match?

Give him an answer.
Do you really think Tom and Mary are safe?
It's a book.
We want to help.

No one came with me.
Go outside.
You have no reason to complain about anything.
Do you think Tom would do it this way?
You're an extrovert.
He's a Georgian.
Mary laid a pencil.
I'm waiting for 2:30.

Tom talking to you about Mary?
You don't have a chance.
She doesn't want to wait for you.
I ate a donut.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
Are you my cousin?
Tell him to be careful.
You're dirty.

I'll go get them.
Happily, no one was hurt.
Some say that I am unpredictable.
What a mess!
He heard a cry for help.
Didn't you hear the scream?
Flying is fun.
Could you call the doctor, please?
Do you know sign language?
Tom's sunglasses are still on the table.
I'll stay here until you get back.

Who kissed you?
I'm not going to marry Susie.
We're better than you are.
You don't have to be nervous about such trivial things.
You're a bastard.
Is that you?
Please call a doctor!
I'm too busy to go.
Find someone else.
Do you have professional experience?
Is that the only solution?
They're not sure what they did wrong.
It's going to be very difficult to do that.
It's ours.
I decided to quit.
Can we turn off the TV?
Don't you remember Tom?
You ever cut a sheep?
You don't like it?
So, what are you offering?
I never went to America.
I don't want to die.
We just found the murder weapon.

He once loved her.
He loves football.
Birthdays are important.
Here's your key.
You don't like bathing?
At what time can you come?

Drop Tom's ball.
Tom's trying to figure out what he's gonna do.
Is that good news?
We're not really hungry yet.
See Tom's boat?
Tom doesn't do everything he can.
I'm sure you'll find a good job.
You're thin.
Tom doesn't trust the police.
Perhaps this world is the hell of another planet.
He picked up the butterfly, clamping it between the thumbs and the pointing fingers.
It's delicious.
Women are so weird!
I've already considered this idea.
Tom hit me in the head.
Am I interrupting something?
I can ski.
Do what they tell you to do.
I'm looking for you.

I think Tom's a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I like to roll cards.
He's a slut.
What's a computer?
I'm not illiterate.
Did you sing yourself?
What do you recommend?
Tom decided to do so.
Your medicine is ready.
I thought you were interested.
Well, everyone's his own, huh?
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was upset.
She was a foreigner, and she was treated as a foreigner.
Karen went there alone.
Am I nervous?
The girl we saw waiting for someone outside Tom’s house was Mary.
Why don't you stop smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He wondered why his wife abandoned him.
I think I've put too much sugar.
Do you know how to skate?
I know how it's done.
Tom ate it?
I don't have to cook dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
A hotel can accommodate 300 people.
I baked Tom pie.
He can ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had allies.
Tom has two girlfriends.
What's Tom doing in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary would want to do that.

I have a lot of time.
One more thing, please.
I'm a member of the team.
I had a stroke last year.
Mom's busy preparing dinner.
Horses are useful animals.
Quickly come back.
He's incompetent.
Thomas was practicing.
He's unbearable.
He's sure he'll take the exam.
Tom voted for the offer.
Tom told you how long it took him to do that?
Let's get started!
Attention!
I'm exhausted.
The perspective is not too bright.
I do not believe in anything supernatural, but I am fascinated by the devil’s literary pessonic.
The problem is that she lacks experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their child John.
I wonder if Tom will actually go to Mary's concert.
Tom said he spent the past weekend with this?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's just not do anything.
Tom wants his father buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm DJ.
I hate Christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It's too expensive.
A child has been lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to hold back.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're losing.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Speak up.
The surface of the balloon is a noneuclidic space, so it does not have euclid geometry.
The negotiations were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I never killed anyone.
Be honest and straightforward.
There is always hope.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice my age.
A journalist was kidnapped by terrorists.
I missed the ball.
I hate this town.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
The programming languages are his hobbies.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many watches do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
So I don't like eating fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is very proud of you.
Your doctor says you'll be fine.
You're a panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need that money.
My tie is orange.
Is Tom still crying?
So I'd like to be taller.
I have to help Mom.
His book inspired me.
Are you brothers?
These aren't my ideas.
You have a plan, right?
He's walking.
Tom's not in town.
My shoes were worn out.
Next year's going to be worse.
Mary in yellow dress.
Love has a bitter flavor.
The meeting is over.
You should have done it last year.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I've got an old car.
We understand why.
I eat every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
Let's take the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockey player.
We went into the woods looking for insects.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.

Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat now.
Mirror fragments were scattered across the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She skipped school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom, I don't think I should do this.
Government debt is increasing.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom will probably never do that.
It's a doll.
Save!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Tom still has a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the Internet.
You're beautiful.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's go meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't digest that.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom leaves in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We can speak.
The computer can count very quickly.
You're not needed.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I am thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for dinner today?
You can't even change the diapers.
Do people still use web cameras?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she quit school.
This word is borrowed from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
My brother is sick.
Don't push.
The car's outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
No rules.
Layla became pregnant very quickly.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make a salad out of raw fish?
Tom knew he knew Mary.
Tom's making breakfast.
No doubt it will rain.
Tom did not mention Australia.
Obviously, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We actually went to Boston.
There are many volcanoes in Iceland.
John is two years older than me.
Better or worse, television has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.
He answered my question easily.
What's the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He must be innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When does she come?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm really glad I did that yesterday.
Tom still lives next to you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I talk.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you see him often?
Tom you'd like.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She has wine.
You'll stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, excuse me.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in the two thousandth year.
Tom's probably gonna take care of it.
It has to be the right color.
Tom has a very strict mom.
After a short peace, war broke out again.
It's better not to trust Tom.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What's the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you give me some sugar?
Where exactly does Tom plan to build his house?
"Where's my laptop?" "On the chair."
I don't think there'll be any problems.
Tom's broken?
You need to have a haircut.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing football.
How does this work?
You're very ugly.
Hurry up, boys.
I'll fix my shirt.
When is his return expected?
I've had a good night's rest.
He's no less good than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I make too many mistakes.
He is not afraid of death.
It would be nice if we had 28 hours in the day, wouldn't it?
Kobe is where I was born.
He would like this catastrophe not to happen.
We don't expect to win.
I don't have any money.
I don't teach here anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Take the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a di-jay.
Tom will soon learn to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They know how to fish.
Tom's out of the room.
I'm still doing it on Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom's teaching French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thinks he can do it.
I don't have books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He's, as it were, a robotic man.
Answer the question!
You're needed in the hospital.
I can't find the lifts.
It's a fake.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do it.
He has green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
Sadly, it's true.
Is it true that Tom has never been to Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, there was a Grand Prie broadcast.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
English is not my language.
I had no friends in Australia.
Do you think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's her name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So we shouldn't do it again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom looked at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the children while she's gone.
I'm cooking now.
Have you seen Tom's passport?
Want to dance?
He's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom shaved his head?
Why would Tom do that?
I know the girl's father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't come with us.
I've got thirty points.
If I don't do that, Tom will be angry.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write that down?
The big tree fell on the road, and while I was driving, it blocked my way.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have many friends.
Do you believe in the existence of a god?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
He didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don't you get bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I'm not working for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
That's what I've been trying to do.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son new sleds.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister, Sakiko, who was born the same year as I was, and now she's preparing for exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Did you finish your homework?
Monday will probably be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help Tom paint the fence.
Why do humans act like apes, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Asshole.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go see a doctor.
I've put my ID on the visa.
It's snowing today.
She continued to work.
The rope broke when we climbed the mountain.
Tom's driving.
If you ate fewer hamburgers, you'd probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go in person.
Please show me how this is done.
Aren't you dating anybody?
All the bench's busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What date is it today?
Where's Daddy?
Lock the door.
I'm not going to speak French to Tom.
The apple does not fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
The uncle is the brother of your father or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She has red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was wearing jeans.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
That's my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined Satan’s Church.
I still want to do this to you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Do you mind?
I haven't seen you in all eternity.
You're obviously right.
Whose books?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks dogs twice a day.
Let me take a look at Tom's book.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honsu, and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't do it.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I can't help you.
It's gonna work out.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare with him in a tennis game.
Who asked you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We've equipped our office with computers.
We have to pay in advance.
Are you sure?
Do you think Tom will die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it immediately.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book became the object of criticism.
It'll be brilliant.
I'm very scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm on the fly.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom will do that?
Tom witnessed in the Mary case.
I thought you'd gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask your name?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You need to quit smoking.
I think Tom is betraying.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Can you play violin?
Will you give me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks well in French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
He himself was popular both among students and among teachers.
Tears can't help.
Tom's playing soccer and running.
You can go wherever you want.
I'll see Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know that Tom can't speak French?
He always sings when he showers.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up the phone.
I'll be right back.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why would you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do it.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell him to do it.
He speaks esperanto with a little French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't care about it.
She's got good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like speaking French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a ladies' man.
I'll deal with it.
Did you find any errors?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a wizard?
Am I good?
Even a teacher may make mistakes.
Fuck off.
Will you let Tom turn you off?
You're a good woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Tom actually moved to Boston?
Tom stretched out Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
Language speakers subconsciously follow the rules of their language without even knowing them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters pointed their rifles at an elephant.
There's no wavering.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Thomas’s wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do this.
I'd like to take the money off.
I shook Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You don't have to worry about tomorrow's exam.
Tom voted?
I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do this.
Tom started to flounder.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You can't escape.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you spend your vacations?
This year you got a Christmas present from Tom?
I still miss home a little, and so many things seem strange to me.
I have some memorization problems.
Where's Mom?
He came to his senses three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know why?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks in three foreign languages.
Tom's a little behind schedule.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a cab here?
Hurry up or you'll be late.
It'll be hard.
Tom always behaves like that?
I like golfing.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It'll work, you'll see.
She left him.
Tom's safe.
I finally got my driver's license.
I'm not a student.
That's why Mary was sorry.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone's late except me.
Stop it!
It's a book.
I'm not planning on rocking the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed in your efficiency.
Didn't you have a car before?
Have you been to work?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Good afternoon.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom's going out tonight.
I told you.
She was on her way to the airport.
She studies Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this would happen?
What's up?
If natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom will be in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We're going on foot.
Tom said what happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you tell me I was joking?
That's why it was so boring.
Tom said I was beautiful.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take the trash out.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston map?
Your sister's always great.
This will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him, you need to consider his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
It's his obsession.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly left the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was wearing a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a son doctor.
I know it's not going to be possible.
Do you have any headaches?
Children imitate friends, not parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with friends outside.
Whatever happens, keep calm.
Tom sent a message to Mary.
He's always happy.
When Mary reached the bus stop, the last bus left.
Tom's wearing a black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We used to speak French.
Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're worthless.
Have you tried talking to them?
It was much harder than it seemed to do.
Her friends ridiculed her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I doubt Tom can win.
Aliens come and take our work away from us, land for the earthlings!
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
Are you going on the train?
Tom said Mary was good.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, right?
Is that why you still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad and never returned.
Get your toys together.
It was much harder than it seemed to do.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I feel better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your job yet?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's easy to do.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but older than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was too heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I still wanted to sell it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would.
You missed something.
I immediately called Tom.
You looked interested.
It'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I love her.
We really don't have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
Ken has two cats.
I knew what was wrong with me.
I love trips.
The phone doesn't work.
That's what we want.
Tom's wearing sunglasses.
Tom's a good painter.
All you have to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can I rent a Halloween suit?
Tom's busy and can't help you now.
We're not a couple.
The student wants to see you.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm starting to have a fever.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Tom really thinks someone's listening?
You don't need a change!
Tom, you might say, is nice.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I should've gone early.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like it?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a grunt.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
You know?
Tom wasn't mean to me.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
Could you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got my ticket for free.
You're such an unbearable man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did my best.
No, sir, she's free.
I'm very interested in studying French.
Be nice to the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't believe anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your job.
Do you work around here?
You admit it, don't you?
I've got business to do tomorrow.
I'm not neat.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but I grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding.
I'm sharing everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom talks about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I don't sleep well.
Wouldn't you buy that?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did?
You did it?
I'm having trouble sleeping.
Tom sometimes annoys me.
I'm a pretty good dancer.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obvious you're going to have to spend the night with us.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
I never said no.
Rio already has a subway.
Are you ready to help us?
Tom is a rare bastard.
His hair was getting thinner and thinner.
Yesterday my sister went to Kobe.
Don't you speak from an experience point of view?
He likes ice cream.
I was hungry.
What Do You Need to Know?
She has twice as many CDs as I do.
The street is empty again.
Tom couldn't catch a rabbit.
All the dogs are right.
I think Tom hates me.
We're so happy.
Tom and Mary are both very upset.
Aren't you staying with us?
It's Communism.
This is where the river suddenly shrinks.
Jesus is a parasite.
I don't do it often.
Tom is a very practical person.
I have a good mother-in-law.
I need political asylum.
There was a calm after the storm.
There is no simple way to succeed.
There's the train.
He loves tigers.
It rains, so we can't do it.
It was extremely surreal.
These students are Koreans.
Get out of here!
What's your name?
Tom and Mary plan to retire when they're sixty-five years old.
Can I use your phone?
Your suffering makes me happy.
When did you do anything for me?
We locked the door.
There he is!
We're different.
Tom and Mary know?
Are you all right?
Don't sleep with the light on.
He's not stupider than you.
The trains in Serbia are very slow.
Tom seems depraved to me.
"Connie" is a set of words.
Where's the ashtray?
Can you explain what you're talking about?

What's the guy's name?
I always get up at half past eight.
Did I invite you?

Are you French or English?
He turned around the horn.
Just keep doing what you do.
You made three mistakes.
There are no rules, but there are some exceptions.

Tom speaks French too.
Aren't you ready to help us?
I doubt that the new offer will be accepted.

Can I try?

Do you want to know how?
Do you like Chinese food?
That's why Tom went to Boston.
He resigned at 65 years of age.
I lost my pen.
I'll keep working.
I was at the meeting last night.
Layla's late.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she did it.
I'll be in Boston in a few days.
I've already done it.
I stayed after school to help clean up the cool room.
Everybody wants something.
Tom has green eyes?
I always forget people's names.
Why are you asking me?

Tom helped me wash my car.
This is our first Christmas here in Australia.
I take care of my grandfather.
I'm going to drive at ten in the morning.
Did you come by train?
You're not as young as Tom.
He is slowly recovering from his illness.
In Rome, do as the Romans do.
He saw an expression of surprise on my face.
Hurry up and you'll make it to the train.
It could be cancer.
I wonder if Tom will actually do it.
I don't like ice cream.
I don't want to sell the car.
I just want to measure it.
Tom's car was confiscated.
Could you open the window?
I wonder if Tom's scared.
How well do you know Tom?
You can go.
I have Tom's keys.
Let us in.
I'd like some more butter.
Apparently, Tom likes it here in Boston.

Here's your change.
Tom was waiting for Mary.
Rio de Janeiro was founded in 1565.
I'm going to Boston with Tom.
I don't think you can do that.
First, you have to understand yourself.
I was there yesterday.
I'll wait here until he comes.
Tom can drive.
I read novels randomly.
I was going to tell Tom, but I forgot.
I'm a hero.
They love us.
I really need your help.
Tom betrayed you.
I got up about six.
I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty smart.
Does it matter?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Tom may not even be on the team.
I ask myself if I can trust him.
What happened to her?
Are you drinking?
I was angry.
When did he arrive?
Where's your teddy bear?
What's up, Tom?
Maybe this year we'll finally win in Europe.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I was able to forget my wallet.
Cats catch mice.
You can go.
Tom said he wouldn't mind doing it for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do it.
Why would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the earth’s magnetic field with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
It's Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in, I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this somehow?
Am I making myself clear?
I'm free today.
Thomas will probably be punished for doing so.
Nevertheless, Tom is happy.
There's no need to hurry.
Are you happy?
I didn't believe him at first.
The phone's not working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Come inside.
Tom can be fined if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really stupid.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary that he saw John in January.
You always get up early, don't you?
She's always contradicting herself.
They live in the same state.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Tom's already in French.
The earth moved from father to son.
There are no roses without spikes.
I hope it's not them.
Don't drink too much, huh?
Wait for a surprise tonight.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He left his family.
Shall we?
You don't need to contact Tom.
I shaved.
I'm the boss.
Tom did a good job.
You have to get home by 9:00.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted he did.
Tom can't drive.
Tom spent the day with his daughter.
Each student has his own desk.
We were ready.
I'm worried that I might be sued.
My family lives here.
Tom's listening.
I got away with it.
Tom speaks well in French.
I know I'm going to learn a lot.
I went fishing on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
The party's over.
The unicycle has one wheel.
"Daddy, look over there, shark!" "It's a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very friendly.
I'm a nerd.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my mistake, not Thomas.
The congregations were quite good.
At this time of the year, the wind blows out of the ocean.
I saw Tom smiling.
Hyde, come on!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned it.
Go and beat that bully.
This is our car.
Hi, I'm Bashir!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I'm sorry I did that.
Should I go to the hospital?
In her spare time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom sings Cantri music better than anyone else I know.
He drinks a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how dressed she is.
Have you seen his new movie?
I'm good at it.
Why did he quit?
Tom said Mary's gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unbiased opinion is that it's a terrible film.
You're very elegant.
Whatever you want.
I could change.
It's significant.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
She's at Tom's.
Tom was barefoot.
I did my best.
If you see an error, please correct it.
We tried again, but we didn't.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do that.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You have to help her.
You don't cry evil.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to climb that mountain.
Tom missed dinner.
You speak English well.
He loved his parents.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love can't be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What is this theater?
Did you see the squirrel?
Mary said Tom told her.
Tom wasn't a very good witness.
I went to visit my grandmother.
I hate the wedding.
I heard the front door ringing.
I can't keep up with you.
Mariana dances wonderfully.
My grandfather is from Osaka.
I want massage, I need to relax.
Tom's so lucky.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you manage to sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did it.
When do you think Tom will be here?
Is there snow coming tonight?
Do you care?
Are you seeing someone here?
I live in Milan.
When did she do anything for me?
I ate an orange.
The square root of the two is an irrational number.
It's small.
Didn't you know this was going to happen?
Bad thoughts produce bad things.
Did you bring a hairdresser?
Tom's not wrong.
Do you have the change from this coupon?
Tom seems a little embarrassed.
We can't do without water.
I can't get my mind together.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in a village.
I would never give up.
I speak French freely.
Tom didn't waste his time.
Give me a hint.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He was very drunk.
Tom says he's happy.
How are you feeling now?
How many guys are there in your class?
These are big apples.
Choose a gift carefully.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something like that?
The richest man in the world could not buy his love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
The lack of news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers will save us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You've been to London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I walk slowly.
After the movie, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We're getting married in June.
I wonder if Tom left Boston.
I threw the bones.
The book lacked several pages.
I picked up a coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks promises.
We have to protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sarah don't get along very well.
Each student has his own desk.
I spent 12 hours in the train.
I'll regret it.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom has no thirst.
I learned to eat the cow.
I'm fat.
I'm sorry I'm not rich.
The news was very sad to her.
I have a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see it yourself.
I've never killed anyone.
How's your name pronounced?
She holds flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man's in his mid-nineties.
This coffee is so hot I can't drink it.
Where did you get this?
Are we done?
Are you from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're good at doing this, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I take your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She has red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.
We were ready to attack.
When Is the Celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?
Tom didn't do anything we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom lied to us.
Tom heard Mary got married.
I've learned a lot.
How much is this umbrella worth?
They were both laughing.
What happened?
It can be done.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class got flu.
Remember when you first heard the Beatles?
Is Tom hurt?
I want you to come to my party.
There's no toilet paper.
The word is silver, silence is gold.
Please sit here and wait.
I love this shirt.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved in last month.
Tom will probably still be angry.
I'm going to the airport.
Don't mind her whims.
I'm glad Tom will help us.
Tom will be here any minute.
I'm glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see each other again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I asked her out.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you get to China?
Do you approve of what Tom does?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
It's a perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I slept.
How is it my fault?
As for Switzerland, have you been there in winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It got better.
I'm learning Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off the loan debt.
Try looking at it from Tom's point of view.
The window's open.
No one thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You will be happy.
Tom looked pretty sick when I last saw him.
Tom's still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from nine to five.
Let me do it with you.
Mary watched a romantic comedy.
Grab him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom's such an asshole.
Would you like some more potatoes?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a mustache.
I have three questions for you.
I met Tom several times.
Are you using a text CPU?
Tom and Mary do a lot together.
Please move.
What are you doing this evening?
Why did you paint the bench red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, right?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not.
Let's go home.
I said hello to Tom.
Tom took off his ring.
I'll give you breakfast.
Tom was listening.
Who broke this window?
Your ideas are a little out of date.
