I didn't tell them.
We will send you.
Up to the tower, the wind of the ladder.
I didn't say anything.
I've got dogs coming to my playground.
Hey, Meg, how are you?
I don't want to be in that room.
We've heard voices.
We love you.
"Tom, there's two masters in front of the mob, they've killed you!" "Tell me you didn't hate me, I'll sneak through the bedroom window."
The buyer's right, he's wrong.
Do you have any?
Now it's clear.
That's what he told me to say.
I have to get to the phone.
Do you know Tom?
Tom had it more than a year ago.
He's been trying to make a big deal out one after the other.
I'd like to know more about television and systems.
I remember seeing them.
I gave him books.
We won't be working until Bob comes.
I'm on duty.
You were absolutely right.
Tom has a French doctor than I do.
Last summer, I and I climbed Mount Fuji.
I didn't want you to.
We're going to hurry.
Why am I poor?
Tom didn't know Mary very well.
I've got to go, my wife's coming.
They're mine.
There's been an experiment.
You didn't go to the police station?
Tom and Maria were on duty.
He's not what he is anymore.
I bought myself a stereo system.
Tom's got a lot of company.
"You can understand what the lie is?" "..." "He has a mouth."
It's dark.
Everything you've done.
Did the dog bark?
I'd rather be a bird than a cook.
A doctor on a tour.
I'm talking to a boy and Italian.
Tom said Mary didn't listen to me.
Don't drink water.
Are you really sure Tom had me?
It'll be scary, turn the lights on!
Do you have something to say?
Do you have any allergies for a job?
I don't know what he said.
I don't want to, you spent your money on me.
We're in Boston.
Who took my purse?
Suddenly, a lion will attack a trainer.
You want to talk to Bill?
Don't put it on my desk!
We'll talk, I'll be back, okay?
Tom went out with a dog this morning.
Your mother?
Do we have any trouble with this?
Don't you tell me what I'm doing?
I just didn't go.
You didn't write or leave.
Our literature is richer.
Tom's telling the truth.
We'll have the weather, we'll go out to the park.
It's my fault.
It was extraordinary.
I'm going to court.
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk
Is he doing something?
It's over the mountain.
Tom already ate.
Tom's a little cramped.
You're speaking straight into what you're talking about.
That's why you're doing this.
I'm eating at home.
Tom eats food?
It's a pen.
We're getting closer to turbulence, and we're going to get our belts closed.
Did I lie to you?
We've worked hard, so we can and go now.
I've seen him squeal.
There's a melody in the house.
Did Gogol burn the volume "Death of the Souls"?
Who did you help?
I don't want you.
They went to the museum on a bus?
It's a tough breeze.
He's doing his best.
They made each other.
I'll take it.
Did I go straight?
The prince was on the horse, riding from the hunt. He was beautiful, and he was in her house, that she was alone, and weeping.
I knew it was coming.
I wasn't one of my friends.
I don't understand you.
It's like a firefight, like a fire extinguisher.
I'm new here.
You're the one I'm looking for.
This time you're not alone.
Is it meat or meat?
I can't hold a cup.
But, by the way, it's a lie.
I'm sorry.
It's the weather!
When I get home, I'll send you.
He's been working for days.
Are you crazy?
Did he need this?
That's the dictionary I've been asking for.
Did you have a job?
There's a lot of books in your house.
I'm going for a walk.
I just want to defend your opinion.
There are no birds in it.
No politeness, but it buys.
We need to know that our team is weaker than our team.
Are you sure you're right?
It's a game.
I didn't say anything.
I'm in love with your daughter.
He's been busy, but at least he's got us.
My mother doesn't smoke or drink.
Is it good to have less work?
I want you out.
Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy.
Tom said he didn't speak very well.
Mom bought me a book.
The death of Stalin King of the Republic of New York, Nikita Khruciev.
The apples are beautiful.
Mary was in the red house.
When I got back home, I started writing.
It's one of ours.
I've had it before, too.
It's the stores.
You tell me to tell me what you're doing.
He's reset the paragraph to the paragraph on the table.
He said it was theirs.
The writers of the castle, the readers of the castle, and the rent.
I've been in his office for more than a few hours.
I'll take care of the food!
It's your husband's day.
Don't you think people don't?
I know you're not going there.
It's a great way to make friends with him, to talk to him about him.
You overestimate people.
I've got a chance.
You're not being polite.
I love the cool ones.
A child, a child, an orphan.
Do you tell Tom?
I'm glad I'm smart.
The poor man is not the one whose name is not, but he who has many works.
He's flying.
Are you in?
Tom will tell you the truth.
Tel-Aviv is the city.
He's coming tomorrow.
Someone's got to stand on the watch.
I told you what I was doing.
Don't just stand there.
You'll have to wash your head all day.
The sugar is sweet.
You could have taken me.
We didn't do what we did to her.
Don't you have a job or something?
I'm a colorist.
I'm not going to the house.
I don't want to be a felon.
Tom's home.
It's a lie.
Tom's been looking for Mary as a kid.
I've taken care of his name.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
I'd come to you if I had anything.
I'm sorry about that.
The rope is strong.
Young man, you have an eye.
He was in a terrible situation.
You're my nose.
We've done a lot of things, and we've done a little.
"I'm afraid I'm afraid."
Tom had a lot of trouble in the office.
I'm crazy.
That's why you didn't do it.
I'm going to have you read and write before you're ready for the product.
That's why it's hard to believe that his father-in-law was murdered.
I took the letter.
Who wrote that?
I know he's allowed to go.
We said good-bye.
Tom would be a good teacher.
Guess who I'm calling Tom!
It's until six o'clock.
Tom at the hospital wasn't in town.
He's right.
I can't take him.
Hebrew was a little more to him than he did.
You like to ride, love, and drive sleigh.
Wake up!
Tom coughs.
Mary gave me a ride.
Tom doesn't like to tell him that he does.
Did they tell her about it?
It's going to be warm soon.
Take everything out of your pockets.
I speak the same language as I speak the same good as the same language.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
There's a lot of water.
I'm worried about you.

The girl's gone to sleep.
She sent me a handkerchief, and it says she hates smell.
Who's older than my sister and sister?
She was wearing glasses.
You've recovered.
He's been working on it.
Give me some pepper.
I couldn't have my subject, she's on it.
I'm going to put myself on my mother's bed.
I'm sorry I made you leave.
I don't have to take my chest with my wife.
She's got her way in the middle of the house.
Tom lived to the age of 90.
You got us?

I could have sent you.
I'd like to talk to Tom about his brother John.

The cat's in the cart?
Could you lend me a pen?
Have you read the book yet?
I don't want to talk to her.
Tell me what you're doing.
Did he kill you?
That's why I've tried Mary all the time.
Don't you talk to me?
It's a snowflake.
I'm not sending you.
He killed him.
I have a wife and three wives.
What's wrong with you?
I don't want to take this letter.
Are you all right?
I didn't want him to.
She's taking you to cat-and-mugs.
Take off the stew, please.
I didn't have to take a job with him.
I just didn't know what to say.

You'll believe it, you'll do it.
We've got an atom, an atom with a cop.
Muriel is six years old.
It's not true, but it's true.

She sent him a letter.
It's a hell of a thing.
I've been thinking about it all of a sudden.
Jane's daughter wasn't here.
You haven't read the book?
Elderly men grow up in strangeness.
At four o'clock, I'm on my way.
I haven't been with her since.
Are you on a bus to Boston?
Tom lied to me.
There's a lot of people in the park.
Sanchez, it's still like a water gun bottle.
Come on, you're gonna hit the bus.

You don't want to go?
You didn't go.
Tom's following us.
Mary is smart and capable.
I'm afraid of dentists.
I don't tell him.
You've got a lot to do.
We're not going in.
What were you doing, did you do that?
The field is a small, isolated, quiet, and sour village.
You know him better than I do.
Tom's gone, Mary.
That keyboard is good.
I don't speak the language so well.
I've had a lot of fun.
He was in contact with them.
Put the car in the garage.
Do you have a car?

Tom doesn't lie a lot.
It's not a problem, but it's hard to deal with.

Are you crazy?
I've been talking about a day of my life.
You're both beautiful and smart.
Don't get your nose off! Don't get your nose off!

Help Tom!
He doesn't want to go to the factory.
It's a big deal, isn't it?
He wants to go to prison.
We've done it.
I'm worried about you.

That's the law.
Did she get her, did she?
I've got a dog.
The computer's gone.
I'll be fine!
Tonight we're going to have a job.
If I were rich, I'd take care of it.
I know she's a good girl.
Are you mute?
A horse without a hand, a child without a rod is not a good thing.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
Mary was in the middle of it all.
The criminal surrendered.
He's like a mother to me.

Tom's translating.
Good night, Dad!
Tom's got six men.

Oh, my God!
You put your knives on.
He took care of it.

We didn't do it.
I don't need to move anymore.
She doesn't wear pants.
She doesn't want to, you knew all about it.
I didn't know who I was.
Maybe I'll tell you what I'm doing.
Would you be famous?
I thought you loved me.
That's why I wouldn't do it!
I don't want to go.
I'll drink a horse.
We've got to go to the hospital.
Get rid of the ground!
The entrance to the museum.
The people want to live their lives, their self-esteem, their image.
It's fantastic.
People have been haunted.
Were you home tonight?
Don't you take a job?
"Who are these cows?" "My cows."
Romans, go home!
That's his weak spot.
Tom was grunting.
There was a well in the country under the lisp.
I've been talking to people with friends.
I love you as I love myself.

It was quiet in the house.
I've turned my back on it.
Do you have a menu?
You're short, you're afraid to fall in love.
Mary's smart.
Don't forget Tom has tomorrow's day.
I did it.
Tom put the alarm on two.
Tom said Mary's in the hospital.
I've taken 268 1968.
Take it easy.
We're going to have an operation.
Let's go, baby, it's time to go.
He's a drunkard.
In the dictionary, there's a lot of words.
We sent your letter.
I've done the work I've done.
No, I don't.
I've killed people, I've killed them.
Tom's gone.
Tom wasn't here.
I didn't get any more of that.
I was happy to meet you.
You didn't know?
That's what I'm talking about and what I'm doing.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I won't.
I've seen you before, you had a beard.
Think about it!
That's a good idea.
Tom's all right, Mary.
How's it going with your sister?
Why are you doing this?
I come here a lot.
I've been doing a lot since then.
You didn't do it?
I can't see him.
Do men and women have the same image?
She's taken to Australia.
Tom went to Ken's letter.
It's a lot of stuff.
Tom made me go.
Say hello to her from me.
My house is on the hill.
She didn't say anything.
One gesture is more than a word.
Tom doesn't have a name.
It's less than that.
He's not taking my job as a non-standard, but he's taking it in a very different way.
I don't want to.
I don't agree with you.
I told you I wasn't leaving.
It's ten o'clock in the morning.
He's flying.
"You're mine," thought the dog and bark at me.
Who told you?
I could have spent the night.
It's seawater because it's soaky.
She didn't know her name any more.
I'm not going to go to the factory, and I'm not going to go to the factory.
It's the kind of evil and the kind of badness that you're looking at.
What was the thirty-something of the women?
The Doctor insisted on a hospital for him.
It's not like you're doing it.
It's raining since the resurrection.
He was in a hospital.
He lived a lot of his life in France.
I've made a kid.
She's bringing me to the hospital.
It's been underwater three hours.
Can't you tell us?
Tom was very popular.
He was really married.
I'll know.
My professor of mathematics is a lot of insomnia.
Tom was lying on the bed.
He doesn't have time, and he doesn't have time.
The fruit is sweet.
It turns out Tom's an omniscient.
I went to Boston.
The old house will be destroyed in two days.
It's easy to do it.
I've done it.
I charge 100 a day.
The phone's ringing!
And my race and my race was all filled with soap.
I don't want to go into it.
Put the book on the table.
He put that word in his dictionary.
I see myself in my eyes.
I'm surprised Tom doesn't speak English.
The Siberian tiger is on the verge of extinction.
You're taking a bus to school?
You're gonna hurt me.
Neither.
Do you have a regular or a regular failure? Should I recreate the charges?
You sure did.
How old have you been?
Bell invented the phone.
I went to the hospital.
I'm glad you're coming.
He's got a life book.
We've got to go to a bowling alley.
Someone said Tom was coming.
I'm going to kill you.
I couldn't do anything.
They clean two times a day.
I've got a book on the cellar.
Did you buy a payload?
You missed your chance.
I'll be careful.
It doesn't work.
Tom gave Mary the keys to the office.
I didn't sleep.
Do you have any complaints?
We can't do that anymore.
Tom's a better man than I am.
That's the word I'd like to find.
He's the one I want to send.
Are you in love with me?
I want to make the house safe.
I'll buy myself a fucking car.
Mary soon told me that he wasn't a democracy.
Wait a minute, don't hang up!
Have you read them?
I live here alone.
Do you think Japo has a lot to do with it?
I thought you shouldn't be on duty.
I'd like to tell you my town.
Tell me you're leaving.
Gandhi was right.
But I do.
Tom threw it away.
I don't have a house. I don't have a house. I don't have a house.
My mother is a teacher.
I've been working on it.
Tom's been writing a table this morning.
She's not here.
Tom's back and forth.
Are you in charge of me? Are you in charge of me?
I went to 1972.
It's a squared squared.
You don't have young people in you.
I used to be a scoundrel.
I don't have my head any more.
How do you live?
Bring me some water, hurry up.
I can't speak my own words.
She's a fish.
They have sugar.
That's the rule.
I didn't kill you.
It's not like that, is it?
I read the book.
It's fruit juice.
He was willing to do so.
Panda's gone.
He's got a plan.
I couldn't do it.
Hokkaido is on the campaign.
We can see.
He's not coming.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Don't talk to the driver, he's driving.
Tom's got a darkened face.
Tom surfer.
It's less than I've ever seen.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Tom, we've got a job.
That's good.
We're eating the same thing now, I can't stand it anymore.
Are you at your place?
Your hands are shaken.
I wrote to her.
Are you doing this?
It's a little peanut orphan.
It's early.
I'm gone without them.
The school was at 3:30.
I told you she wasn't here.
I'm taking Tom as an idiot.
I fell in love with you.
The film was good.
We're alone.
Distinguishing is the value of being equal.
Don't talk about it!
I wonder who sent me roses.
Our lives are ours.
You're the one who stood up.
He's gone. He's gone.
I buy bread.
The castle's castle?
I know you were last night.
I'll ask Tom.
I've done what I'm doing.
Tom's in Boston.
My mom went to the store, didn't she?
Anna's got a lot of books.
I've been talking to her for a while.
He's a cab driver.
Can you drive?
She was wearing a tiger mask.
Blessed are neither the spirit of the spirit.
I'm on my nerves.
The doctor told me I smoked.
Tom fell asleep in the theater.
We went to Imola, and to Peugo-Simple or Simple-Pego in our own way! Fight of the day: Protest-Pego against Yarno Trulli, all of a sudden. Simple-Pego-Pego is all right, but, to the same extent, a minister like the Marshals, the First, and even Jarno Trulli took his car.
Tom, we have a problem here.
We do what we don't have.
It's a problem.
I've got him.
You know what I was able to object to, handcuffed me and took me to the camp.
Did you bring books?
I don't like it.
We're on the move.
Tom couldn't be whining Mary anymore.
This is my brother Tom.
You got on the wrong trip.
What are Tom and Mary talking about?
That's what you're doing.
Do you have someone in you?
We're leaving in an hour.
It's time for the kids to go to bed.
Can it rain?
We're in space.
It's a carnivore.
How are you, have you, mother, mother, mother, son?
You're lying.
It's cold in space.
Do you want some of this?
He's got a lot of books.
I live in the first place.
What would you do if you did?
Thank you very much.
Are you Tom's mother?
It's like a typical bell ring, it's a couple of acquittals.
I can't walk, but I can limp.
It was the European Sabantui of 7ix in 2014, in the Warman Garden of Riga.
I love the beautiful.
It's been a long time.
Be modest, humble, good, good, don't talk too much. Don't talk too much. Don't talk too much about it, don't talk about it.
The bus, the bus, it's not going to work.
You're the one who's in the middle of it and you're the one who's in the middle of it.
It was his fault.
She didn't know what she was doing.
We're an agent.
He won a bronze medal.
Do you have a cripple?
Whose shoes are these?
You've been there.
Don't fall.
I'm sorry about Tom.
No, I'm tired.
I want to buy a camera.
We're walking in the park.
Don't worry about yourself.
I've been waiting for you for five hours.
I'll buy a price.
One led to another.
Do you have a wife with you?
She's a student at the moment.
Coffee was so hot that I couldn't drink.
I've got books to read.
You want to know what this is?
You've done everything.
Don't be silly.
That's "a" on "a".
Are you eating food or are you a vegetarian?
What are you doing?
I live here.
She likes to go out alone.
They all came after me.
God love, love, love. If he hadn't made so much of it.
Tom says he's already done it, just like he did.
I'm not used to this cold.
You can and can do it.
There's no bone.
I've done my job.
Tom speaks English.
I hate myself.
He loves his great-grandfather.
Tom's a golfer.
Do you have a sister?
The transition to the police force is not a simple task.
I don't care about sleeping pills.
His house is three times more than mine.
He's a very good man.
That the Jesuits bear the power of multitude, that they have the will of the peoples. But their intrigues, their intrigues, their actions, and the actions of many men, have failed to bring Catholicism to the triumph of the world.
She's gone.
That's all I know.
I knew it was coming.
Tom bought a sports club.
Who said that?
I have an older brother and a younger sister.
We didn't help them.
I'm telling you the obvious.
I'm sorry about that.
We've made it.
My dog ran away.
What are you doing in the hospital?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We've had a lot of fun.
We can't help you.
Do you want him to take China?
I'll take this coat.
I can't look, I can't look, I can't do it.
The Esperanto's got her own office.
Are you there?
She helped Tom.
Do you want me to do this?
I'll take the rent.
I'm Susan Green.
Tom from Boston?
I haven't been to Micronesia.
Go on, go on.
That's a tough turn in the house.
It's hot.
I told him I was tired.
How many times did you take the subway?
We're in the hospital.
I know what you're doing.
Believe in yourself!
It's not that cold.
They've joined the whole world: the United Nations, the United Nations, the Americas, Africa, and the United Nations.
Mary's gone.
You didn't tell me.
You've got what he's doing.
He was in the crowd.
Tom doesn't look like a teacher.
I don't want to do it either.
They asked for a salary.
Do you want me to talk to her?
Do you want me to come?
I know who I am.
He's two years older than me, but I'm taller.
He came home early at night.
We'll have Tom present.
You're the only one who's ever been a savior.
She's stupid.
I was there that day.
Sit on the bench.
Tom's not sorry, he's sorry.
That's why I got bored in five minutes.
They are men, and they have knowledge of wisdom, but have no idea what it means to be.
Get me in touch with Dr. Bellych.
Do you know the Fly of the shortspeaker?
While Tom was standing in the bar and drinking beer, he was the kind of guy who picked up a beer.
His news was very encouraging.
You'll lose weight!
Tom didn't think Mary had a coat.
You didn't tell me you didn't tell me?
I'm studying at school.
He took the bus.
You've done it.
Mary sits on a bench in the garden.
I sweat this day.
We didn't do it.
I'm sorry I love you.
Courageous.
You need a joystick.
Did you take longer?
She took the car.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It was warm and comfortable.
Why don't you come with us for a swim?
Tom's got a bag.
She told me to go.
He's been in a lot of traffic.
To my parents, I don't want them to, I'm sorry.
I didn't put you in a hospital like this.
She's a good girl.
He's not coming.
She never did.
I was wrong about it.
Your name's a scoundrel.
Tom's a mess?
They thought they were alone.
Say hello to your wife from me.
I have no idea who you're talking about.
We've done our best.
Tom changed the book from book to book.
You gave me the wrong phone number.
Tom asked Mary to make coffee.
It wasn't easy for him to hold back.
Take the book off the shelf.
Promise me more than that.
A year ago, our home was in Dushanbe, the capital of El Salvador.
He's in the trunk.
It's my name.
She didn't want to. He left.
Tom's boots are too tight.
You're not dealing with this plan?
I want a map of Texas at 1 to 250,000.
He's his friend.
We're going to have to do it to others.
I've taken Mary.
Are you ten years old?
She's smart and trusting.
I don't want you.
Be careful with the mixer, don't worry about it.
Don't you take me in?
I'm on my way.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It was founded in 1229, but not in Toulouse, but in the case of heretics.
The old man's hungry.
I'd like something to be in a train.
Is there a pharmacy nearby?
Tea's tough.
What are you doing, Tom?
You're in for it.
It's a sport.
He's mad.
Don't take your initiative.
Who's running?
There was a lot of work on the bus.
Are you all right?
The brakes didn't work.
Weeping, weeping, weeping, weeping.
He wants to come.
I thought I was Japanese.
I can't let you go without a pass.
Masha's not a good man.
They have cold hands.
They're talking about us.
Tom objected.
It's getting dark.
At two o'clock in the morning, the girls landed in Mississippi.
Are you doing this, from the office?
Did you take care of that?
I can recommend a lawyer.
They didn't get sick.
I don't eat bread.
Tom died.
It means you're a monster.
I don't like him anymore.
You've turned my head.
Don't expect much of me.
Tom doesn't want Vikings and Norwegians.
He didn't do it.
Is that so much emphasis?
Did you get French wine?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Is it hard to tell you?
Get lost and don't show up anymore.
Do they love you, and so that they're together?
"You don't know, did you have Tom?" "Yes, I know if he did."
I like riding on horseback.
That's what you're doing.
Tom broke the record.
Is that all of it?
Tom's daughter got pregnant when she was 15.
He lived with her for years.
You need to press the button.
Has it stopped raining?
She's got a white cat.
Emily's very friendly with me.
Tom said, "Put your hands on your necks," and he said, "Put your hands on your mouth."
I've been studying all my studies.
We took him as we asked him.
I'm sorry I didn't.
I'm trying hard not to let you go.
It's all straight!
Patience is a plaster for wounds.
I'm a turk.
Two "n" letters.
Tom's in town.
She got pregnant.
She's got a problem.
I sent Tom.
Enjoy the Mongols!
Tom said it was about you.
I don't want you here.
We don't have any.
He doesn't speak English, but also speak English.
She's wearing jeans.
I'm glad you've been with us.
It's your day in the year.
I'm sure you're good enough.
Mary's in the hospital.
I love him.
She's a good girl.
My brother's in France.
"Where's Tom?" "Where's Tom?" "Where do I know?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've been thinking a lot.
I was talking about what I didn't do.
I don't know what you're doing.
He said he said he'd wet his pants.
My sister was a beautiful girl.
We've given it to him.
Birds do it.
Tomorrow I'll be at the hospital.
Tom was at the nightclub who didn't drink.
Love it.
Give me a cup of coffee!
Tom speaks on the raft.
My grandfather, my grandfather, my grandfather, my great-grandfather, and my great-grandfather were called the same name as me.
I've got a problem with you.
We only have three hours.
They're washing salad.
She took her bike.
Did you do that?
Don't ask me anything!
I've taken myself this way, I've won the lottery.
I've got an Esperanto for me.
You're on your own business, I'll back you up.
I went to see Mary.
Tom was sorry he lied.
I'm so proud of Tom.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Did you steal them?
She wears her heels on her heels.
People would have been dead for a long time if they hadn't been.
I'm gonna shave.
You're a mouse.
Tom wasn't in the hospital.
I'm locking myself in the table.
She's at home.
Don't you think you can't lie more?
You didn't do it, Tom.
Did you do it?
I did it like he was taking the toilet a minute ago.
Tom put a book under his pillow.
Did you do "We are incomplete"?
I don't want to, she'll send me.
We bought five beautiful apples.
Tom is here.
Tom's got dogs.
You're the one who's coming.
You've got to go.
I can admire her.
I don't know Tom anymore.
Get in a circle and hold hands!
For now, I've been working my way!
I don't want to mess with her!
My mother often bakes pie apples for us.
Obviously, he did it.
The dog's gone.
Tadasi has a voice.
Did you buy your briefcase?
Tom wouldn't want to buy a car.
How'd you do that?
What's the entrance to the museum?
We got her.
You're surrounded.
You know, he's got a lot of things he's done to make his claim.
I'd like to see to it.
How often do you clean?
We kept our word.
Do you love her?
My father was a Greek.
Are you so busy?
The German forces with Dad took him to Asia.
I'll pay the cards.
We're not going to run out of anecdotes.
I told you something was wrong.
Not one of the "heaven of Lights" in the soccer arena is clogged by one of them.
I don't want it anymore.
He ate bread and meat.
You didn't go to prison, because you did.
Do you want me to cook you something?
You've got your daddy.
I cried.
I don't know how to do it.
I've got a lot to do.
Do you have a head?
I know I'm imperfect.
Theresa was in 1910.
I'm out of here.
A month to the end.
I've seen someone.
Tom's at the campfire and the party.
I was about to blossom the tulips soon.
Tom told Mary he was hungry.
You've got a bad name.
Tom got in the car and took it.
If I were rich, I'd appreciate it.
This letter is addressed to you.
Did you do that?
Fresh fruit and vegetables for the feast.
I know it was a crime.
It's spring in the Northern Hemisphere. Autumn in the Northern Hemisphere.
It's in the violin.
You don't mean anything.
Does he speak the same language?
You've been misled.
Is that a shame to you?
I'm good.
Have you ever seen a kangaroo?
Tom is a good athlete.
She's in trouble, you've got to be patient!
I was on the bus.
I want to, you're the one who sent me.
Susan left an hour ago.
She's coming tomorrow.
I've had a hard time.
We will not forgive you.
Get Tom out of here!
Are you on your business?
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
Tom didn't say anything.
Tom made a pie.
It's a waste of time.
I've got a bucket.
Have you ever been there?
His book was a great book.
How many people are there in the park?
And my sister didn't make it, and I started.
Who is God?
It's a map of America.
Would you like some tea or coffee?
Is Tom on the way?
Things have gone wrong since the beginning.
We're on the move.
Are you going to sleep?
I wish I had my name.
Will I take your rubber?
We're talking about the day.
Do you like liver?
I've got a bad stomach.
Did you teach me?
I love you, I love you.
He was in prison, it was for me.
It's all started.
I don't want to go with her.
She speaks very well.
He's gone to town.
I'm on your way.
I've got my hands out of the way.
He's got seven men.
You need water.
I'm sorry, Tom, I'm sorry.
One man, but a sick man, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, you've got the wrong guy, you've got no job, you've got no wife, you've got a bitch, you've got it.
I've never seen Tom in a helmet.
Tom drinks red wine.
Do you love your liver?
Move on.
You tell her because you're what you are, what you are.
We've got our own home.
I don't have any.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
What's my plate?
What did you say?
She loves you.
You broke the rule.
I've got a red car.
I've been on a diet since the day.
You don't have to come tomorrow.
Do you have your wife?
You can imagine what it was like.
I don't want you.
Are you going to help Tom?
Look for your work.
Tom's mad?
Don't you?
You're gonna do it.
No, I'm not singing.
That's why I'm not here.
It doesn't tell me anything.
How can I counsel you?
I'd have thought, not three, but three!
I didn't like taxes.
Not all of them returned from their office.
I'm all alone.
Mary misses her husband.
There's three bedrooms in Tom's house.
That's why you want to talk to Mary.
Bach and Hendel are with the officers.
I'm coming from the U.S.
How about summer?
I want to lie down.
He's a little bit more aggressive with him.
I'm glad you're on my behalf.
Are you sailing?
My wife's doing a good job.
You've done a lot.
I've got to go.
Tom wanted to go to the beach.
Be nice.
Tom asked Mary for a job.
Who was it?
I ate.
That you should think about it, to the best of your ability.
It's gold.
There's no other problem, it's very comforting.
I can do without my glasses.
It's been a long time, spent on the police, Barbara against the police and the police against Luciano.
I'm a man.
Tom won't live.
I'm writing with a pen.
The Mile Way is the star of the galaxy galaxy.
Tom waited three hours for Mary.
Stanisławz, he said, "Sometimes you have to shut up, you've got to go."
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've got a lot of books and papers on my hands.
I'll have a day to take care of.
He bought it.
He's on the move.
You didn't.
Did you see what he said?
It's the death penalty.
The bullies were surrounded by the police and the police.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
He's not doing much.
The kitchen's in your house.
That's the guy.
I'm afraid I'll have five minutes.
Are you sure you don't want my allowance?
Did you take my daughter?
Tom's gonna go, like Mary's with John.
I don't think I know it.
You're blind and you're a king.
It was a storm.
No, that's it.
It's important.
It's been a long time.
That's right.
Don't think about it!
At the time of the death, the crew of the army was often treated as a losing party.
I don't want you to.
They got off the bus.
I'd like to talk to you.
I'm glad I sent you.
Tom's got a job.
You didn't let me.
Are you paying your bills?
It's really hot out there.
I'm sure you're good enough.
Have you ever been to a disco?
Get dressed!
She was nodding, she was knocking in her chest.
Cats catch mice.
She's in the hospital.
I wish I had a knife.
I told you how good you are in your language.
Are you crazy?
Your friend is also from the hospital?
I love egg squirrels.
It's hard to find a good job.
He lived his life in France.
We've got a puppy.
You weren't there.
I was in prison.
Do you think it's better to go to Boston or Chicago?
What'd he do with it?
We're dealing with this.
Is he coming?
I'm learning psychology.
I didn't get any tips.
His eyes shined with joy.
I left the house.
Don't worry.
Can I get a drink of wine?
You didn't do that?
Do you have any friends and friends?
You were surprised.
U.N.U.L.S.S.S.S.S.S.
"Your husband's going to work?" "No, he's going to drive in the car."
I'd love to.
I don't know, they're coming.
I speak Mariyan.
I've seen her.
I don't want to, he saw me like that.
I've got your bag.
He's got a talent.
There is no fear in the house, but a woman casteth fear out, because there is torment in fear. Fear is not perfect in the feast.
Tom used to teach me lessons a lot.
I've had a hard time telling her, "I love you."
Tom Mary gave him a chance to give him a chance, but she coldly kicked him off.
He's late for his date.
I don't know what you're doing.
The dog's hungry.
He sent you.
Can you help me with this?
Don't drink it!
The captain was a captain who left the tone of the ship.
He's got a job.

Are you talking about it?
It's more sauna than sauna.
Mary didn't understand what Tom wanted to say with a phrase.
You've done it.
I want to speak the same language.
We do what we do.
Wake up, come on.
Go to school, not to go!

She's gone to bed early.
The beer's on the top of the beer.
Water freezes at 0 °C.

Mary would like to be a banker because she likes to be a banker.
I parked under the tree.
Did you ever bother?
But that's not the case.

I'll send you to the station.
You don't have to deal with the beauty.
There is no God.
We don't have any in here.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Did you know about him?
He's a doctor like he's doing.

I wish I could have done that.
You've got a very good story.
You've got a hard time.
I put them in the hospital.
Did you believe that Judas was the idolater of Christ?
If you don't obey the law, you will be raised up. So the king is the king of the law.

You're going to be a good man, you're going to be a good man, you're going to be a good man.
Tom took my bike.
Do you mean I'm somebody?
We're going to the front room.
The way you do it will be the same.
Is that all right?
What are the letters in the word?
They've taken me as a tyrannical.

Let me send you.
How do I know that?
Tom wanted to, you did.

On my behalf, that's two cases.

He's gone in four hours.
I need to get a haircut.
If you don't, you don't eat.
I didn't think she'd be on the table.
I'm on my way.
Is there a place where you're supposed to be?
Love him as he is.
Call me back in an hour, please.
"Don't cry," she said.
That doesn't mean anything.
Poor Tom has been asleep for three hours.

I couldn't go to that night.
Mary doesn't put her sugar in her coffee.
They had seven.
I'm away from my grandfather.
I cry.
There's chaos in Mary's life.
You didn't take me?
It's fun.
Dad, what are you doing there?
Where are you going?
Looks like Tom's not doing anything.
You didn't let him do it.
He looked like his grandfather.
Father often taught me lessons.
What are you doing here?
Tom went to one of the students.
I command you to take a ride.
I know his brother well.
I can help you.
Didn't you tell me that Tom was going to Boston with us?
Tell me it's not true.
With my feet out.

Russian is the glory of the speech.
My brother is my brother.
It's good home.

He doesn't mean it.
Did he come from Osaka?

Do you have a word with me?
Was that Tom's fault?
Guess!
I don't care!

We had a meeting this morning.
I need to clean the apples.
He apologized to her for being arrested.
He bought Hondu.

You're gonna wear your shoes.
Get your hands out of your pockets!

I got up early this morning.
You have to talk to her.

I love your little sister.
Are you taking the subway for the last time?
I don't mind going to six.
She's not a doctor, she's a doctor's doctor.
Tom's been married for a while.
You speak English, sir.
I told him to tell him that.
He writes a story.
Are you cold?
We're already booked, Prague.
I love you a lot.
They seem to be unfamiliar.
The morning is wiser.
I'm behind the crowd.
My friend is dear to me, but I am a friend, but I am a friend, and a man: having a second power will appreciate my power. He will tell me my name.
I'll change the translation.
He speaks well.
Don't let me go!
You're a poor guy right in my office.
Tom makes himself loved.
It's dangerous with fire.
She was kind to me.
How do you get this insect on the bark?
I'm sorry for your request.
I've told you to tell Tom what he wants me to do.
John's on the move.
I buy myself.
Give me a beer, huh?
His house was small and small.
Tom didn't buy it.
If you were a man, would you?
Do you want anything?

What are you talking about for a new teacher?
How can I know him?
I wanted you.

Tom misses you.
Did you think it was anybody?
Hold the bars for me.

I'm sorry.
Is the sky blue?
I'll be a policeman there.
Tom said you didn't.
They're squirrel glasses.
You didn't take it?
Tom's under the tree.
The fans are thrilled to see you.
Don't forget to write this letter.
Tom's got a collection of mom's.
Tom took our case.
I'd like to deal with Tom.
And drive and smoke for good.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
My subject is a bipolar.
Hold the bars for me!

We've done it.
You can take care of it.
We're not writing pens, but pencils.
I've been meeting people all day.
I'll ask him tomorrow.
That's the scarf.
Are you whispering?
Tom loved Mary.
Mary's a little insensitive to the pain.
You didn't take him?
All the apples are beautiful.
Tom gave Mary a lot of money, she didn't want to do it.
Do you think your books will replace you?
Tom told me how he did it.
Tom was so ugly that Mary was taking a stand against him.
You took the phone.
You're so cold with her.
She's proud.
I can't help you.
Is that what you're doing?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Let's play hide-and-seek!
Do you have any?
I didn't do it.
She's an actress.
Tom hates me.
He's so good.
I've had all the fun of cats.
I'm not studying at all.
Who are you with?
Tom took his glasses off and took off.
Speak louder, Father.
Tom's partner.
Tom's the kind of guy who's telling the truth, and that's a lot of people don't like it.
She's buying food.
Could you please ask me?
Do you have a book?
Welcome to the United States.
Are these yours?
Who are you waiting for?
Don't talk to him while he's driving.
What are you doing?
She did it.
The child's not the only child.
Tom and I are afraid.
They're the ones who you are.
Let your uncle do it.
Have a drink.
Tom likes to talk about golf.
I think he's pretending.
Tomas would've done it.
I'm a better man than I am.
Is that what you're doing?
I cough.
Or is it unelegant or both?
Tom's gone to Washington.
She's ten years old.
She can hardly speak at school.

There's an orange on my head.
He who is in chains is free.

Poverty is the mother of all vices.

Are you awake?
Are you all right?
Will I take a picture of us?

I promise you the gold martial arts.
They're on the way.
What's more important to you?
We're bankrupt.
You're going to the hospital.
We've got to take care of it.
That's all Tom told you?
How did you get Tom?
I'm assuming you've got a favor.
What did you do?
One widow had two widows.
I don't have any money to go for.
It was cold outside.
I want the truth about my husband's death.
"Here's the damned rock!" grunts the witch, like past her broom about the young woman on the pollusesos.
If only I could do that.
Nice to meet you.
You're on your way.
Are you going to be rich?
I read the book.
I wonder where she's going.
Maria sat down for her computer.
Tom's got no letters or letters from him, I'm on it.
I'm wearing a shirt.
There's a lot of C in mandarins.
She's out of brass.
She doesn't speak the same language.
I was married.

Did you get it?
She doesn't smoke to him.
Is it a sea or a lake?
I love you all the time!
The book is on the table.
His affair was good for sale.
Vadouz is the capital of the princely kingdom of Paris.
Are you calling us?
Tom took Mary to the other end of the meeting and went in there to talk to her.
Did you get someone in Boston?
Just act normal.
Do you like your wine?

Oh, by the way, there's something I need to tell you.
We've done a lot of things, but more.
They can't fly. They can't fly.
It's been a long time.

The police shot Tom at the office.
You should want to.
Aunt Vang, it's me.
I don't sleep that much.
Be a guest!
She's gone.
Some of us are wrong.
Come on in.
She didn't want to, he's gonna go.
Did you take him?
Tom told me.
The wind is duet.
It's not like you've got a problem with it.
Did you take a bus to Munich?
I don't think you're up until I'm done.
He's not honest.
You can do everything you want.
Tom said he didn't have a job.
She writes a book.
Get out of here!
It's autumn coming!
What are you talking about?
Two hundred and a half.
I could have told you, but I won't.
Tea's hot.
Tom turned it on.
I know I know that, but I can't do it.
Tom died.
Are they doing the same thing?
It's not someone like Tom!
Tom's got something to do and what he's doing.
You're taking me to goodbye.
He puts the car down.
My husband shut the car down.
It's the land of my country.
We don't fear death.
Mary's gone.

Tom wants to take care of us, but he's got us busy.
Take care of yourself.
It's cold in the wintertime of Moscow, wearing a hat.
Tom fell asleep reading the paper.
The Frenchman, the Frenchman.

"Are you up?" "Are you up?" "Are you up at eight hours."
Tom paid a lot for that old car.
Mary's gone to Tom's office.
What are you doing here?
Good luck, gentlemen and gentlemen!

We've got to go to the hospital.
Tom's got secrets.
Tom's with Mary like she's with a bitch.
Do you still have it?
I'm driving the truck.
She gave you that, didn't she?
I've been looking for you.
I've had my case.
You're Tom's wife, aren't you?
He jumped out of bed.
There's five men on it: the police, the police, the police, the namesless, and the pinky.
It's so bad that he's on that day.
We're sending tea from you.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know, I don't know.
Do you know him?
Have you ever had a good time?
Is that you?
Did Mom buy the eggs?
The news came out instantly.

Mary brought you in.
You want me to go after you at the hospital?
Who would I be without my own warheads?
Hey, you don't transfer me!
Did Tom talk to Mary?
We knew the teacher wouldn't.
Tom told me that it was Mary who lived.
Are you young?
Hello!
It's time to go to bed.
I'll never forget him.
I couldn't get out of the house.
I thought you were a doctor.
You're the one who took the job.
"Do you have you in me?" "Everything."
I can't tell you the truth.
I'm with you.
It was hard.

I've taken you to your office.
He's, so to speak, a member.
You don't go and you don't go.
Tom freeman, not a freeman.
What are you doing, getting sick?
You don't go and you don't go.
Did you get this from Tom?

Take care of yourself!
You don't want any?
I want to be sure.
Let's pause.
He's invested in it.
What did you buy?
I'm sorry.
Do you have any?

That's all I can say for now.
He's got a brown pencil on him, he's got it.
We haven't succeeded in anything we've done.
Clean the apple, whatever it is.
You've done me a favor.
Whose is this?
Tom was torn apart by a bear.
There were a lot of students in the hospital.
I'm looking for lipstick, and I'm looking for a blanket.
More than Tom loves himself.

Much is at stake.
I have more oranges than apples.
We've been here for six years.
I didn't ask you.
I've done it as she pleases.
Tom didn't want to be with me.
I'm here to talk about you.

I didn't know what I was doing!
I've been here before.
Linda's up, so sing.
You've been on your way.
You and your brother, Mary!

I've got a lot to do.
I've seen him before.
I bought her my car.
Tom won't love you.
Mary of the GDR! Tell her to know?
Tom's got very little to do with his brother.
Mr. Smith is here.
Have you been drinking a cup?
We told each other.
The a square root of the second b, the a squared b, in the formal record is a2 = b.
Tom's in the weight of forty-four fifths.
He loves math, and I don't.
My cat killed the mouse.
Don't be like that, Tom!
We can talk about it.
I have a good friend in Boston.
"Who are those letters?" "The writings of Linda."
Reyncarn doesn't. It's only once.
He's got a hard time.
As the peace would have been beautiful, it would have been half as much as the peace of others.
Prepare for your surprise.
He didn't.
I can't hold you alone.
It's a story about friendship and friendship.
Try not to.
He'll write a letter.
I'll build a house.
After he's left alone, he's a reader of books.
It's a traffic accident.
We don't have to go to school.
Tom's friendly.
I've been looking for you.
I'm making rules, it's not my fault.
We won't forget you.
It's a knife.
They don't represent any of them.
The bacteria, the kissing bacteria, your own system.
Who's got the book?
It's for you, Tom.
Tom took Mary's farewell and got on the bus.
My dad was happy with the result.
I've twice done it three years ago.
Tom's gone.
Do you want apples?
Mary doesn't want to go to school.
It's not a seller; it's not in uniform.
Write down your address.
You've been doing better all day.
Tom didn't go.
Tom's gone.
I'll give you a chance to miss it!
Would you please salvage me with salt?
I bought a car with a ten-digit discount.
It's getting dark in winter.
They're leaving for winter to the warm country.
That's where he was supposed to be.
I'm a doctor.
He didn't do it.
Let's do this!
See that?
Tom doesn't have a single official, even white.
I was tired, and I fell asleep.
Ours needs help.
Did I overslept?
Did you go to aliens?
Tom's on the couch and he's on the couch.
I've never been to France.
I've been summoned!
I'll kill you.
Does anything bother you?
I don't have a relationship with her.
I'm so happy to send you.
Detective novelty.
Tom said he was talking about what he was doing.
I don't know, I don't know, I'm nervous.
Would you like to be famous?
You're tired, go to bed.
You've told me what you're not in?
You've got to go.
I'm not in the hospital.
How come you didn't show up?
Pinocchio was exhilarating.
There's a lot of beautiful parks in Boston.
I can't deal with these people!
The promise is made.
My name is the head of the head. I'm the head of the head of the head.
Where's Paul?
That's why I dreamed that he was dreaming.
Is that your daughter?
That's twice as much as it is.
He's taking you to my house.
Don't you know what?
It doesn't look like him.
Did she correct that word?
We didn't have to.
I've come, I've done it.
What did she buy from your shop?
A lot of things happened.
It's a good day, isn't it?
I'd like to talk to you, but I don't have a ticket.
Comrade Tom is at the Lady Mary's.
You're the one who said it, you're the one who did it.
What are you doing?
Tom and Mary have something to tell us.
She went to the bank.
They've been looking for you.
"You live in Tom's house?" "You live in Tom's house?" "He lives in me."
I'm sorry for the pie.
Are you Hungarians?
Your mother is a computer.
I'm late for my flight.
It's a very lively campaign.
It's not like that.
That's not really true, is it?
I'll take the testicles.
Oil from cream.
I have to get back.
I'll call you back.
You'll change your mind.
She was a beautiful woman.
I speak the same language.
We've got a lot of stops.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
I got up at 6: 00 a.m.
Do you have any tickets for the concert?
Tom wanted Mary.
About nine and a half feet across the woods.
I've come here.
I didn't lose weight.
It's a good idea.
I used to speak German.
I've asked myself a few times.
That's why I had a lot of people in my country.
It's from one to ten.
He's been sailing the sea.
Don't forget your pills!
Tom gave Mary John's number.
Who-who could have brought a beistpiel bill to the police?
Faith is like a bird, a poet, and dark.
It's a hell of a place to go.
I took a car to Kyoto.
Tom went to Frankfurt, but we didn't.
I've just started.
He saw the Greek in the river of cancer, his hand in the hand of the Greek, his cancer in the hand of the Greek, his cancer in the hand of the Greek, his claw in the hand of the Greek.
We're on the move.
He wanted to know more about them, and he wanted to know more about them.
Translator, deceiver.
I was at Tom's.
She'll be in New York two times.
You're not doing it.
You want to see Mary tomorrow for the day?
Tom gets on my nerves.
It's more gold than it is.
Don't throw yourself on the floor.
Tom will soon be there.
There's a lot of Financients going on.
Mary wanted to be a writer.
There's chaos in the house.
I'll take care of it.
You're all right.
You're giving me the money, you're giving me the money.
I've seen Tom's name in your name.
How long have you been in Osaka?
What are you doing tomorrow?
I don't want you to take me naked.
Tom's not Mary.
Tom and Mary are gone.
Tell me in your face.
You're on your way.
The trip's late for the time.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
I've never been on a plane.
He pretended to be himself.
You said you did.
Your team is better than ours.
I'm afraid I don't have a license.
Tom doesn't like it. He's the one you're laughing at.
We've got to get started.
I don't eat marmelade, but I don't eat marmelade.
You're a thorn cactus cactus, aren't you?
Next to the sink in the kitchen was half an apple.
If I knew his address, I'd write him a letter.
You can't do it without a gun.
You're allergic.
Loved guests and virgins are glad, but for the best of the flock, you're welcome and you're welcome.
Bring me two or three chairs.
Jim's going to go right and left, but there's no way to cross.
The teacher gave us a message.
You have no right to do that.
You've done it.
I look like I don't mean anything.
What's your bench?
He's a gynaecologist.
He's gonna send her a hook with the kids.
It's a very important thing to do with our peoples.
Tom is a mutant.
Didn't you tell me that?
Tom's not a gangster.
The patient has a painkiller.
It was colder than it was.
“You don't say anything, ‘Why don't you tell me? ’ ” “No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Tom wrote for the occasion.
I'll take you in the car.
Did you make his request for salary?
Tom had a lot of businesses.
Tom doesn't have a name.
The village is away from the rest of the world.
I've played a game.
You're the one who did this?
I've got a lot of work to do.
The square is a rectangle, you've got everything.
You'll finish your job for the year.
They told me they weren't married.
I was so happy.
Even the cow's got milk.
Tom White?
You're on your way.
They treated us like idiots.
How would you do that?
Do you have a job?
Tom's gone until I'm gone.
I don't like non-Punctuality.
I didn't realize that either.
I'm taking my toothbrush.
Father died when I was nine years old.
I don't have it.
He lied to me.
I went to Copenhagen.
Tom's on the move.
I'm sorry I was rude.
Do you like gassed water?
You didn't go to school?
I'm sorry.
Does she have a brother or a sister?
She's a walker.
Tomorrow's gonna be beautiful.
I've asked you all the things I've done. I've asked you all the time.
Tom's a good name.
It's my job to take care of it.
What's the spider's eye?
I've done my best.
I'm going to vote.
The bakers left him behind.
There was no wind in that night.
Artist Tom Thomas.
I'll tell them what I know.
Are you sure you're right?
You're not welcome.
Society won't take root in the U.S., because it's not like a proletarian, it's like a Lutheran.
I'll take care of it.
I didn't take you like that.
You're hungry, you're hungry, you're hungry.
She's bringing food to her house.
Are you your teacher?
I don't care who wins.
I'll be here on May 15th.
Tom pleads guilty.
"What's the power of force and power?" "Most of the rule is that both the power and the power of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the state of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the state?" "" "" "" "" "of the state of the state of the rule of the rule of the rule" "of the rule of the rule of the rule" "
That was the way it was.
There's something I can teach you.
I think Tom's right.
But what?
Tom bought his house.
No, you're not.
He's got a lot of him.
I didn't say anything about it.
Whose son are you?
He's not crying in the house.
I mean, I'm in the middle of nothing.
What's your house?
He's been born at a rate of nine hundred.
Here's my number.
The President's office was in the middle of a campaign.
It's the intelligence of the government, and it's the intelligence of the government. It's the intelligence of the government.
I haven't said a word of what he's saying.
You used to live in the country.
He doesn't care about him.
Tom said he didn't want to leave you.
I did it.
Please, eat!
If you're going to take him, he's going.
I want to take care of it.
I know all about you.
He's been gone for two days.
That's all I've done.
Do you have so many things to do?
It's the distribution of the language in the public language.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Have you ever slept in your office before?
I've been sleeping nine hours.
I didn't know you said that.
Stay away from me!
Tom's talking.
They have the same car as we do.
It's been three years since my little sister got married.
Come on, come on, or you're gonna kill me.
Tom looks like he's doing his best.
You can't do it, you can't do it. You can't do it.
It's gone beyond the horizon, and it's dark.
It's better to fly than to sit down.
Is that your dog?
She didn't have much to do with it.
He gave us baseball.
I love grandma.
You've got it!
I'll be up for three days.
I've lost all sorts of willingness to do it.
He's going to be a prisoner.
This tree is older than I am.
Say hello, please.
Tom died in a dream from a heart attack.
Tom doesn't smoke anymore.
You don't look like you.
On my behalf, you're wrong.
It's noisy.
I'm sorry, Tom.
Is he awake?
We've got a lot of work to do.
We're going to memorize a poem by heart.
This mountain is three meters [3 m] high.
- Nothing for nothing.
We'll write a letter.
You can't take him out of your mind.
Our troops are in a dead end.
The golf ball hit Tom.
Tom didn't want to breakfast.
What did you tell Tom?
Tom says you're going to detain three cases.
Is it sand or sand?
We knew all about it.
Did you get up this morning?
He was alone in the darkness, and more.
He didn't have anything to do with the hospital.
Red isn't your name.
Mars has two moons, Phobos and Damos.
Finish it, please.
I can do it.
Did you love me?
It's true.
Are you a Hungarian?
His bike was good.
Are you bored?
I'm going to get a plate, because I'm going to be staying in the park.
I sent you.
You're a good girl.
I love it very much.
That's a good idea.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Does Tom teach you how to go to school?
I'm glad I sent you.
Is it cold in the cold?
If I would wear a dress, I would take it off before this, but if I don't wear a dress, I'm just putting my head down.
He's had a good time with him.
We cut with an ax.
Did you get it?
I need to know, Tom.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's a protest, on my behalf. It's in my office.
You know, I didn't think I'd do anything.
Hey, hurry up!
If I grow up, I want to be a gold miner.
What do you think you're doing?
They're going after him.
How's it going?
I'm the one who sent you.
That's why it's on you.
She eats salads.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I've done it the way you do it.
It's hot in here, isn't it?
Are you drinking alcohol?
Tom was behind me.
I'm ready to go.
Tom won't take the subway, bus, taxi.
I was sent to leave my homeland.
Sooner or later, this was done.
I think Tom is shy, talking to you.
He's very young for that kind of job.
Tom.
Tom doesn't want a rabbit and a rabbit.
I live, I live.
How old have you been?
I've done a lot of work.
We'll live everything.
Tom died of his death.
Do you have your dog?
Help me, please.
I know where Tom is at the hospital.
Is that your bike?
You'll want to go.
It's time for business, it's time for fun.
You've got a bag!
It's not that simple.
I'm sorry. Did you say that?
Tom's not a good man. He's a good man. He's a good man.
We ate in a hurry, and at the same time we did it.
The sorcerer has done it.
It's a lake with a stupid fame because of it.
It's not my day.
You don't want to be called. You don't want to be.
I didn't want to be here at all.
She bought a chicken house.
I've already had a hard time.
I think I've been thinking a lot.
Tomorrow, we'll be back tomorrow.
I've got a shield.
Tom sent me this.
Don't I know?
Did you catch it?
Tom told me I'd be early.
She poured water into a vase.
Are you pleased?
It's part of the cotton in the United States, the United States, and Pakistan.
I can't do that.
Tom's suicide doesn't change anything.
We just can't take that risk.
They sounded good.
My hands are cold.
I've seen them.
I live in Boston.
Don't you speak your language?
It's the street.
Run!
Tom is older and wiser.
You're not a quartermaster.
That's why you didn't go to Mary.
I'll take the ferry.
Are you going to fuck with me?
Do you like bananas?
I've had a lot of fun.
I can't pretend to be without you.
You don't have any.
You're there, and you're there, and you're there, and you're there, and you're there, and you're there, and you're there, and you're there.
I don't know. Tom didn't come, and I don't want to take him.
Tom's going for a ride.
How can we do that?
Where'd she run away?
You son of a bitch!
Tom speaks Italian.
Tell me it's not true!
What did Tom have in his pocket?
The year is seven and a half miles.
That's why I got away from Boston.
Tom has a dog.
Tom's the same name as yours.
Silver is cheaper than gold.
You're sorry about the weather.
I don't know why you're doing this, I told you that.
Tom, I told Mary to send him.
They're in class.
Don't say anything.
I don't know if that's true.
My wife wants to go to Paris.
I'm going to ask Bob.
I want a good dictionary.
Get on the bus and sit down.
Who of the pianists is the greatest of you?
I'm not in here.
He took Hamlet on the run.
He didn't fall in love.
I'm out of here.
I'm so happy to send you.
He put his coat on the hook.
He's got a pair of socks.
"Where is she?" "Slapping on the couch."
You didn't say it.
- Because it's the fate of the GDR!
I'm all alone.
It's for a friend's girlfriend.
He's a man.
That's why you need a ladder.
Tom asks me to send you this.
What's wrong with you, is that you?
It's against the Black Sea to sell bills for the Ukrainian People's Office.
That's what I did to my wife.
I'm both fine.
The refrigerator's empty.
Google is my teacher.
"How many times?" "How many?" "How many times?" "The Pole of a Man."
Is that your book?
I didn't need his help.
Japan is three times a day.
I'd rather not go shopping in Paris.
We both do.
We've got a salad.
Tom's talking.
He wears blue shirts.
I'm a professor.
He called me to the office.
Tom says he's a little cold.
Here we go.
Do you have a fever?
It exalts as much as he himself, to him who is in the company of men.
You didn't tell me?
Tom didn't like me.
Can you tell me about Tom?
He says he's got you.
I don't want to live in Boston.
I'm going to look at you, look at you, look at you, look at others.
Tom, are you thinking about this?
I teach you.
He's passionate about his lips.
I'll call you back.
Could you please tell me tomorrow?
Are you a photographer?
I want you to go back.
We didn't go anywhere.
He's gonna be okay.
That's how he learned it.
I told Mary I loved her.
You're young, you're young, you're in the middle.
He's done a lot of stamps.
Is that a deer?
I'm waiting for you.
Write your letter with a pencil, please.
Mr. Tanaka is our teacher at the office.
Tom gave Mary a day's stay.
Are you talking about the lamps?
He didn't speak the same way.
You're done.
The same moon: she shines, she shines, she is dark, she shines, she shines, she hears, she hears.
It's sweet pie.
Are you crazy?
It's my past.
Jack didn't do a math test.
They seem like they are.
Maria's got a delicious mice-soup.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm not.
I want something delicious.
President Grant is not illegal.
I've taught lessons.
Did you both do it?
Tom's here.
It's not that simple on this case.
I'd be drunk.
Hey, buddy!
It's the bus. It's the bus. It's the bus.
You're mad at me.
Give me the keys.
You were very kind to me.
Now it's a problem.
That's right!
I didn't write a letter.
It's a lake.
And, of course, they're called the office.
He doesn't have absolutely anything to do with us.
He loved Tom's brother.
Don't you mean you're not doing anything?
Tom sent Mary's handkerchief.
You're going to be famous.
Get your name on the line.
We sent you to the theater.
It wasn't his fault.
I've had a lot more trouble with the police.
Tom and Mary.
I don't know who wrote the painting.
We're going to run away.
Good stuff praises itself.
Are you sure she told the truth?
The house is locked up.
It's not a force!
I'll be back the next time.
You're on your way.
We've got tea.
There's a key on it.
He sent me to save her.
I have a fear of death.
He was a prisoner, and he was a man for a man and a man for a man and a woman.
I'd follow him to the edge of the fire.
You want me to get out of here?
The magazine is on the move.
I went to the bookshop.
About 80 in a ten-second kiss.
You don't say the word.
I don't like salad.
I'm not going anywhere!
He's on his way.
We've got guests on the car, we've got to go.
Cats can't do water.
We need to get dressed warm.
I didn't think anything of it.
We're on duty two hours before we leave.
She went to a restaurant.
Did you stay in the barn?
Tom slept.
I don't know who would describe it.
That wasn't the case.
You've got to go, you got to go.
On my way to the theater, I married Yoko.
I'm going home.
I'm supposed to get my head straight.
You're not doing it, are you?
Have you seen any UFOs?
She's not the same as she was ten years ago.
Did you tell them what-- did you tell them?
It was late afternoon when I woke up.
I'm not a fan of music.
Write it down before you leave.
You're gonna need them.
Take it easy!
You can see the bottom of the water.
How old are you?
Don't ask me for this!
You took a lot of blood.
Don't bother me.
Tom said Mary was drunk.
Ask him if he will.
What do you know about Hermann?
Tom's in the hospital.
He didn't take a golf course.
Tom's sorry for the pain and the pain.
Where are you going?
She told him she didn't love him.
You're on time, aren't you?
He's gonna laugh.
He won't hurt her.
Tom was shy.
You are responsible for your actions.
I thought you'd be more like Tom than you were.
All that honey's going to kill.
He's gone with me.
He spoke to her with a high teaching tone.
I'm up, I'm going to send you.
I thought Tom was married.
Do you have your papers?
I'm going to school.
Don't be so lazy!
She's got two cases.
Did you bring him?
We can't take Tom.
I think you're doing it.
Joe Byden is President President of the United States.
You kept it in the hospital.
I want a girl.
My dog didn't bite.
Tom for three years, Mary.
You're on your own.
Are you going to be rich?
Your house has its own property.
I wouldn't do anything.
It's on the front road of the city.
A cat likes more than anything but mice.
It's already done.
Are those your glasses?
You won't be there, I'll eat alone.
Do you have any friends and friends?
Go away!
I don't want Tom to go to Boston.
They put each other on each other.
Can I get a picture?
I didn't tell Tom.
I don't know what to say.
Even death's death's death, we serve the house.
What's wrong with the car?
Tom didn't leave me.
I sold the car.
She lived a life that she didn't love.
They don't give me any credit.
Not everything is for bouquets.
Did you get it?
My cat wants to be here.
Come back, you'll cry!
Are you crazy?
Tom has a cat and Mary doesn't.
That's not true.
The beds are inconvenient.
Is it wood or wood?
Tom's a student.
There was no traffic.
Tom's got a garden.
He's got a gondola in Vienna.
You're next to me.
She wears earrings.
You didn't.
That's wrong.
I couldn't get away with it.
Yeah, I did.
Destiny's over.
Tom's not in your head.
I'm sure she won't forgive me.
My laptop is mine.
If you don't, you'll die.
Honey's honey.
The head is part of the house.
Tell that to Tom.
I don't believe you.
I'm doing one thing.
Do you have any?
"Here's five hundred." "For the sake of the truth?" "From Tom, he's dead."
Mary said she had a cold.
He's not a gentleman.
I don't have a place in my house.
The boys don't do it.
We'd like a table in a nonsmoker's living room.
I tried to find Tom.
Do you think she's getting in?
You mean you're coming?
Tom was standing there and looking at me.
It's the light, sir.
Tom told me to go.
I was in his room.
He speaks Japanese.
Don't read the book.
How's that word coming from you?
It's about to dry.
It's cold and cold.
I've taken care of you.
Is there a river in the world?
He wrote me love letters.
Bring us some water.
Cristiano Ronald is one of the players in the soccer game.
She became a teacher.
I was with my brother.
Let's take you.
Are you going to talk about it?
Are you sure you didn't take Tom?
Do you have an esperanto dictionary?
I didn't do it.
You're crazy, give up.
The horses stood still.
Tom's already there.

Do you have any?
Tom's been eating and sleeping.
Oh, what a beautiful youth.
Tom's talking about wearing jerseys with a discount.
Two hundred dollars is the weight of the sumo wrestler.
Let's go with me to my napkin.
Are you going to Boston tomorrow?
He was on a bench.
Tom's your son?
Tell me, was Tom your husband?
It's a shame for him.
There's a cat on the chair.
She said it was your job.
I have a double.
It was so big that she did.
It's a museum every day, it's a museum.
Are you buying a house?
That's my problem.
He who doesn't have a place in the house will have a place for him, for him.
Do we have an opponent or a geopolitan opponent?
She won't be punished.
I'm on my way.
I don't want to be your enemy.
She sang a song.
Tom doesn't like winter.
I think he'd do it.
That's not the key.
I was in Boston.
Does he weigh his suitcase?
I was in France.
Did you do that?
They didn't transfer it.
He drinks water.
I'm not allowed to go to the theater.
I've got a problem.
I've got a lot of problems ahead of me.
I've had nine hours of sleep.
I'm looking for you.
I don't go shopping as often as I do.
Mary's not going to do anything that would make her feel better than the rest of her life.

Is this how this town works?
Sceptics are in the middle of it.
I have a fever at 38.9.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
He's gone.
If you'd like to, as he speaks English, you'd like to take him for a Frenchman.
She's not with me.
She didn't dare.
I can't stand such a thing.
I swear I didn't eat any flavor in my life.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
My mother's ready to cook.
I don't know you, but I don't know you.

And I'm a Berliner.
I thought you loved me.
Tom's gone.
Did you talk to her?
I already bought this.
Mary sleeps in her bed.
Tom's gone.
You didn't do it.
Oh, it's the weather!
What did you buy?
I've got Tom in charge, but he's on Mary.
I've been drinking coffee.
You're on a bus to Boston?
He's relying on what he's taught.
I'm glad for you, Tom.
It's all right, you don't.
I just can't believe I'm marrying you.
They won't let us.
This is my brother.
I didn't know what Tom was talking about.
That's Tom's name.
I'm surprised she's doing a very good job.
Tell Tom if he's coming home or should I?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Are you clean?
There's a table for me.

It's not like I've had a good time, but it's like jazz.
I'm sorry.
You have a beautiful name.
I'm sure he's the only one in the world.
You're the only one who's ever seen you.
It wasn't Christmas, it wasn't Christmas.
He was blind for one eye.
We had a lot of company this year.
Tom didn't want to come out.
I wanted to write a book for my husband.

There's nothing here.
I didn't say that.
I know who you are.
Your brother's on you.
No, I'm not.

My brother bought two rolls of orange juice.
He's got one girl in prison, and he's got one in Nara.
He's got his own job.
Are you here?
We didn't do anything.
How old is your uncle?
She has no idea who she's with.
You gave me your hand.
Tom's in his room, sleeping.
You've done something.
That's my problem, not yours.
My cat's wet.
Your lips are gentle, like a cactus.
Tom, he was in the hospital.
It is comforting to her, and to her all things, but to her her will not let her trust in all things.
You're eating a lot of water?
He doesn't eat.
Behemoths take water.
Don't remember evil!

She's a teacher.
The house, where Mozart is, is in Saltzburg.
I'm sorry, is that right?

The Alps are already in the foreground of the Alps.

Give her what she wants.
I can't do that.
We're gonna have to do that.
Monica's studying something.
Are you bored?
Have you ever been with her?

Put a lock on the window.
I'm dreaming at night.
Tom was one of us.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm not doing this for my sake.
Tom's a sight, he was offended.
I'm the one who stays here.
Yeah, and you're not who you are anymore.
I went to Achmet.
You're not sleeping?

That's what you're doing!
Don't wake her up.
Did you bring me here?
My house is a place in a village.
Is Tom good?
You didn't take your parents, did you?

She was looking for him because of the job.
You made it.
Everything was fine until Tom started to pee.
Tell me how to wash my car.
Is Mr. Nacamura home?
She's teaching us how.
Do you love me?
I'm silent in the inescapable darkness.
Mary will be writing soon.
You're going to get into the country, and you're not going to hurt yourself.
It happened as he said.
I want to sing a song.
I've been talking a lot about you.

She did it.
It's not like you're in charge, it's not a matter of fact.
Tom had breakfast alone.
A cup of coffee, two men.
She was his wife.
Little kids, poor kids, poor kids, poor kids.
Is there a garden in the house?
Are you going to go to bed?
The book can be a good book.
She looks good.
We all love Tom.
Tom's in the parking lot at Park Home.
Tom wants an apple.
You don't know what it is.
Did he see Tom?

Do you like sweets?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We're both drunk.
Do you want me to take you?
We go to school for that, we go to school.
John, who's in the dark office.
Tom had a daughter.
I'm a good guy.
We're on our way.
I'm not a man, I'm a judge.
If I hadn't told him, I'd have known.
"Where have you been?" "Where've you been?" "A friend's."
He's flying.
You didn't do it, I wrote you down.
I thought Tom would give Mary John's phone number.

He's in the hospital until he's gone for hours.
Could you speak louder?
I love Mary the way she is.
That's what it is, that it's what it is, that it swears, that it's what it's for.
Take my coat.
I'm not leaving.
Kill them all, the Lord is pleased.
I have a brother.
I'm sorry. I've already had a hard time.
You'll stay.
I've already read that.
Tom is a good person.
Does he have any?
I'm not famous.
Are you okay with that?
There's no house.
Does she have any?
Stay here!
She's gone.
I don't have any secrets from you.
Where the hell did I give you?
Tom is my older brother.
You didn't see a cloud.
I knew you wouldn't have told me.
Tom's got three apples in the garden.
I want you for helping me.
You're rich.
She didn't give him much.
We're in the backyard.
He's not as good as he is.
It's not a big deal.
It's a lie I don't tolerate.
Now that you're here, is she back?
Are you going to be a good man?
She told us everything.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
What did you say?
Why would I do that?
In a bag or a shower?
Did you take the mugs?
Did your dog bite you?
Are they good?
Are you sure you don't want to bathe with us?
What do you think I'm doing?
I love it more than I love it.
Are we wrong?
My uncle's in town.
It's a rainbow!
It'll be about every hour of the week.
She was afraid to wake him up.
He told the truth, he would be punished.
I've got a lot of friends with you.
Your sister and her sister are riding on a bicycle.
I'm tired!
My name?
Tom didn't do anything tonight.
The steps were getting closer.
I'm sorry I didn't do my job.
I don't like him either.
Did you do it?
Leto did it.
How lonely I am without you!
We've already done it.
Do you have a fever?
I don't tell you what Tom does to me.
I saw him, and he was a student.
My mother took him to the hospital and took him to the hospital.
The enemy is a friend.
We're in a football park.
I know you.
Are you in this?
No, it's okay.
Is that French wine?
Would you mind telling me if I cleaned the toilet?
I wouldn't mind if I did.
When do I say no?
My father is German.
I love the fall.
Read as many books as you can.
Tom's in the old place.
He's like you, he's going to take ten bucks.
We're all killed by the killer.
I love Holland, but I can't stand the Finns.
Mary's been looking for someone like Tom.
Do you drink wine?
I've read that the president of Chile is in charge of Dilma.
I'm happy with my salary.
I don't know the merit.
She did not say a word.
We're on the move.
I've been on my way.
I've seen a dog.
There's more to it than there is to it.
Tom's been wearing a suit all day.
How do you do that?
I've done "From the Church" two times.
She doesn't have a computer.
I think she's coming.
I don't see him at all.
You smoke too much.
You took the bus.
You're my friend.
There's no pyramids in here.
One thing, what the hell are you talking about?
Ask Tom what he's doing.
It's hot this morning.
We went to the park for the same reason.
Are you all right?
I have one brother and two men.
It's not a healthy meal.
He's out there, and he's three.
Gradually.
I've seen you in the park.
This morning we're here.
There's a way of doing it.
I'll take it from you.
The school's got to take care of the kids.
I'm living in a house, taking my father.
The food's terrible.
The water's going to be packed in six-packs.
I drink a glass of milk before I go to bed.
Do you know someone who speaks five?
He ran and fell off his bike.
Do you love him?
It's all I've done, it's me myself, but I've done a lot of things.
No chess, no ladies, or locks, so he's on the run.
Did you have a good school?
He didn't do it, he didn't do it. He didn't do it.
Am I wrong?
The people are the ones who wear them.
We can't get past the subject.
Do you want to be a nurse?
It's about a hundred meters in 12 seconds.
Bring me a couple of chairs.
I've got a lot of jobs.
I want you to do it.
I was sent to the hospital in the 474th year.
We'll take the bus.
It's the museum.
Did it happen?
I'm not eating anything.
Tom doesn't deserve it, he's got it with him.
He didn't want to, she left.
Tom Mary told me she was supposed to act like a fighter.
That's what you're doing.
What teacher didn't tell you?
What's your language?
We don't have a chance.
The school will soon rely on a flight ticket.
The knees need surgery.
Tom nailed Mary.
She's wearing clothes.
You're a lot of people.
She doesn't speak English, she speaks English.
We love each other.
He was in a crash.
Tom didn't take the sausage and the sausage.
If anyone sleeps, he doesn't sin.
Do you want a handkerchief?
I've done my best.
You'll get it.
It's the weather for the ride.
Let's go?
He's taking his life away from the job.
Are you going to be shy?
Tom bought a dictionary.
George Gagarin is in the United States, not far from Moscow on the 9th and 13th of 1934.
What are you doing and what's going to happen?
That's a good idea.
That's what the law says.
Are you going to go tomorrow?
It's just a matter of time.
Tom's gone in a few hours.
Tom fell asleep while reading Mary's bedtime fairy tale.
It's a lot of lots.
He didn't write a letter.
I should've had an umbrella with me.
Who's going to kill you, get sick?
I know all the secrets.
The nephew is the son of a brother or a brother.
What's with the cabbage and the salad?
Who are you?
Guests will drink beer and wine.
I'll tell him I'll come.
I think Tom is.
The terrorists killed their brother.
I'm sorry.
I've got to go.
Bob broke into the classroom.
It's an act of deception to tell the truth.
2539 is a prime number.
Don't tell me what I didn't do.
I fell asleep in front of the hospital.
"Wouldn't you join us?" "Sia, but it won't bother you."
He's overcome a lot of difficulties.
I wanted to go to Boston with Tom, but he said he didn't want to go with me.
Tom poured in both glasses of wine.
They'll understand us.
They're pretty bad.
The more money he gets, the more he gets into superstition.
Speak to him in the same language.
I'll take you to the hospital, please.
The old man's been on a barbecue.
I live with my aunt.
I'm going to send my grandparents.
The ghost wanders across the country, the mob of racism.
That's what America is like.
Why would I buy my rent for a day?
It's all the same for me.
Tom's gone to Mary's house.
Tom's got a great problem.
Tom didn't say anything.
My father died when I was born.
I've got to go.
I love Chinese food.
Tom is a drug addict.
My mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother'
He's good for you.
I'd be in the hospital. I'd be in the hospital.
Are you crazy?
"I found that 70% of the Japanese are ninjas. Is that true?" "Where are you at?"
What's going on?
I became the second thing that night.
He who has so little as a brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's brother's letter or letter's brother's brother.
He doesn't like it.
I love the landscape.
We've got a force.
You're taking care of it.
Tom lies on the grass underneath the apples.
I think he's busy.
Don't talk about it!
Tomorrow we'll see you again.
It's an ancient book.
I don't think it's gonna happen.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't do it.
I've been in the hospital all day.
I didn't speak your language.
I don't know, but Mary told me.
Tom took a shower and took a shower.
There's going to be a factory.
Did you say that the subject of this was Tom?
Tom eats a lot of fruit.
Oh, my pants!
He's 25 years old.
Tom said you stole the job.
If she loved him, if she loved him, if he was poor, she'd go into prison, I'd hate him if she was ugly.
I want to learn a lesson.
I'd like to talk to you.
It's an incredible story.
Tomas, Canadians.
We can't pretend to be ourselves.
I gave my friend my job.
I'm gonna hurt a boxer, but I won't make it.
I can't take you.
It was a warm evening.
I'm glad you gave me the invitation.
Tom saw you.
I can't take the lamp.
There's a problem with him.
You've been doing all Mary's work.
Tom told me he was on his way.
A friend who's in his business, like a knife, doesn't mean anything.
I didn't understand what you said.
He's six feet tall.
Don't forget your cats!
Jane's sister was dressed like a man.
You're going the wrong way.
He wants you.
Don't go anywhere.
The book was transferred to 36 offices and 100 countries of peace.
They'll come from the rest of the world.
I'm sure she's right.
It's all-eating.
I bought three booklets.
Not all citizens recognize the vindication of merit.
Did you do that?
Tom wanted to go under the sky.
How do they milk a cow?
I laughed.
Riga is the capital.
The squid has ten tentacles.
She took it to him as before.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's not you. You cheated.
Are you alone?
That's right at the moment.
Are you a doctor?
What are you doing?
Did you get so nervous all of a sudden?
Did you get your password?
I've never seen a giraffe.
He writes a letter.
Tom didn't know I was coming.
You've got to go and go!
It's better than it is.
Two beers, please.
I know them.
It's not a prescription.
We've got rules!
Don't you think you're doing it?
Tom was a good man.
Did you speak your way?
We need a job!
Tom's already gone?
They did it.
You didn't tell me anything.
My brother gave me more presents than I do.
There's plenty of water in the pond.
Do you want some?
She's a lot for being stupid.
Tom asked Mary to buy him something.
I've been on vacation in the United States.
I think Tom did.
He couldn't do anything.
I felt sad.
I don't believe that anymore.
You want to buy eggs?
Tom took the book in his hands, and he became his wife.
I'm glad Tom didn't come.
Is this a restaurant?
Hurry up or you're gonna hurt me.
You're doing math.
I'm back and I turn on the laptop, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm trying to hitch on the wire, it's dark!
Who's your friend?
I'm on my way.
He's got his parents.
That's why he died.
Tom's got nightmares.
I'm assuming she sleeps like an angel.
Mary took Tom into the mouse.
I don't trust you.
I wasn't happy with you.
I can't do it without a fact, but I can't do anything better.
Without Tom, I feel lonely.
I can't believe I don't send you!
I'll talk to him about it.
It's the day of the end.
I didn't know anything about it.
Copenhagen is the capital city.
He's on his horns.
I bought my wife's smartphone.
The one who wants to go to the hospital, stay in the hospital.
I don't know how to do it.
The symbol " &amp;" stands for "you".
Speak quietly!
I was in Boston three times.
Tom fell asleep.
We'll stop on that.
Your friend is my name.
Don't fight, bitch, nose, he's with our mark of the one thing.
How can I help you?
Tom thought she was Mary.
They lied.
Don't drink too much, okay?
I've got a plan.
Let's go for a ride.
We've never been bathing before.
You know what this is.
Are you coming with us?
You want to sing it?
Would your mother have thought?
Tom, I'm glad you're doing this.
Do you have to tell me why you love him?
Tell me what you're doing.
You saved us all.
You're so good.
I've been looking for them.
It's not as simple as you're doing.
Is it Mary's ride?
I wish I had told the truth.
I want you.
She called you.
You're the only one I've ever been to.
You helped me.
He's got something on the road with him.
Are you there?
Is he alive?
The plan failed.
The concept of friendship doesn't fit in.
I don't want to talk about it. I want to finish it.
He's taking the car off the hill.
That's why it's cold.
What would you like to buy?
Did you send me?
It's not a squirrel.
Did you go to town?
What's wrong with you?
I want you to come with us.
If it weren't you, I wouldn't be here.
It's a resurrection.
You don't come alone.
She's a young girl.
Are we able to do this?
Get out of here!
I've already read that.
He pleads guilty.
That's not a good way to say it, Tom.
I knew I needed to take care of you.
She picked up the phone.
He doesn't speak English, but also speak English.
Tom, I want to talk to you.
She's a nurse.
I've done a lot of stupid stuff.
They're on the other side.
You've done it.
It's in the hospital.
What happened to Tegeran?
Who took her?
Yeah, you can, but you're not.
Do you want Tom?
It's been a long time.
Tom's gone to the hospital.
You're not Canadian, are you?
That's his problem!
Did you cook rice or Mary?
Tom was proud, and he was proud.
I've lost my mind all of a sudden.
Tom doesn't swim.
Are you wearing your clothes?
I've been started.
We've got Tom all over us.
I'm sorry for your request.
How did your son get into the hospital?
That's pretty clear.
I'm going to work on Tom.
We speak Hungarian at home.
I'm thin.
I've got Tom because he's a scoundrel.
Did you find it?
I've done it many times.
He had everything ready.
I've got a very good job.
Tom's got a mouse.
I've seen your friends.
- "Telephone." - "I'm going."
Tom's in your office.
I understand the text.
Your house is opposite the bank?
I saw her at the hospital.
He was like a woman, and he was throwing pots of pots on my cheek and putting my head in there.
I'm six years old.
Honey doesn't taste good, but it doesn't taste good.
Speak louder, please.
Tom took the loan.
Tom stopped hoping.
Promise me you'll come back.
He's right behind you.
I can speak German.
I love dogs.
They're not with their brother.
It's German.
You're a fighter.
I bet Uncle Alfred is Alfred's uncle.
My wife, Tom, took a short hand and a painful torment.
They didn't.
Potatoes are fruits.
It's hard, but it's interesting.
Tom's got a lot of fun.
Tom is one good friend of mine.
She sent me to see if I could sew.
Don't lose more than that!
It's out of the question.
I don't have a bike.
What are you talking about?
He's my friend.
You're my fault!
I don't see Mary often.
Bob poured in a pot of water.
Do you have a nonalcoholic drink?
Tom did it.
Because half of my colleagues are evil, I'm going to judge them and I'm going to judge them.
I'm glad I found you creative.
Tom Canadian?
And she misses him.
As you know, you're not doing anything.
She's locked up.
Do you think that's what you're doing?
The baby's on her own.
Tom told me a lot.
Tom's your friend?
My mother is convinced she won't say no.
Didn't you tell me?
He finished the book.
Tom smokes on the balcony.
I don't see Tom's face.
Do you want to take my interview?
He was alone.
I've already taken care of it.
The biker was hit to the right by a truck and a car.
Mary was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one of the other who was the one of the other who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the other who was the other who was the other who was the other who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the other who was the other who was the other who was the one who was the other who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one
I'll put him in the hospital.
I took my dog two times a day.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
It's been a long time.
Yeah, it's, no, it's not.
They didn't do it either.
Are you doing this, from the office?
Interesting, Anna.
Are you going to be a good man?
Thief's gone.
What'd you give me?
How did you teach them?
Get off the tree!
He put his umbrella on the bus.
Tom's a little preoccupied.
He asked the audience to keep quiet.
Her car is Christsler.
He's not coming.
I'm doing my own thing.
It's good for me.
The Rhine is the river of the river of the river of the river.
Bill's supposed to be late for school.
You've done it!
She was nine years old.
Are you talking to me about me?
I bought it, but I'm very young.
What happened to Tom's girlfriend?
I'm not going to say anything anymore.
All of a sudden he's going through a violent storm.
Don't you think I'm doing it?
Tom didn't have a job or a hobby.
There's nothing in the glass.
I'll take the cows.
I don't care at all.
Tom was upset.
Tell me, girl, sugar.
Tom, if all the doors are locked, that's what you're looking for.
We don't have to fight.
It doesn't matter now.
I wonder what's wrong with it.
You fool!
You didn't go away.
The French are ours.
You've never been led to anything.
He's got no money to take his office.
Two beers, man!
I've got a lot of people.
It's a snowflake trip.
Until the reform is done, we can't and can't take him into custody.
Take it there.
I'm so tired that I've stuck on my feet.
She's a rewarder.
My God will love you.
I wish you had one chance.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
I was at the supermarket.
What's the matter with you?
We wouldn't be able to go any further, if we could stop the jokes about the campaign.
Tom bought himself a suit.
Did you do it all?
I made myself a sandwich with bacon and salad and tomatoes.
Tom's sitting on my side.
I know your mother doesn't want you to be with me.
I read the novel.
You can't take me, you can't take me. You can't take me.
It'll hurt her.
Get in the car!
Are you strong?
My husband died three years ago.
I went to Paris this year.
I knew you wouldn't hurt Tom.
My mother is Canadian.
Mike and Tom go to school.
I told her I gave her the key.
I didn't use that word in the dictionary.
Tom has custody of the police.
Do you want carrots?
I'd die before I steal.
You're the one I'm sending you.
What's on your mind?
Did you go to bed and Tom was killed?
You're not here.
He's got me.
He's fighting for you.
What's the matter with you?
I'm afraid you're right.
Tom told Mary she'd be fine.
One friend's friend is a vet.
There's a bone fracture on the x-ray.
Gasoline is a hot house.
Your mother drives a car?
You're lying under the law?
You love him more than you love me.
Tom, like you say, won't do it.
He didn't make it. He didn't make it.
You're not doing anything.
I don't like it, you're doing it.
Am I really doing this?
You've got Tom.
He's a boy.
Take him back.
You too!
It wasn't that bad.
Where are you going?
I'm so glad you did.
You were a good girl.
It doesn't look like you're working.
I know where I'm going.
It's what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we claim, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do, what we do
I've had so much pain in my head that I cry.
Mary admitted she was scared.
Are you dealing with this?
He's got a day from day to day.
How often do you go to the hospital?
Is that him?
The bus was empty.
Are we being followed by the dead?
It's my grave.
I read the books, you read the books, Marcus the books.
That's why I wouldn't let Mary do it.
The student could have figured out what he was talking about.
You're the one I'm sending you.
I don't have any money, I'm sorry.
Tom one, he's not doing anything to himself.
I was on the run.
She was talking to the police, and she was in the police station.
Tom was like a son to me.
Talkin' funny.
She held back.
Three hours and ten minutes.
You're drunk.
All of you, man.
How often do you go to Boston?
When I saw the picture, I was surprised how old she was.
I've been an athlete all along.
It's been a while.
One man said to me, "It's hard to understand my soul."
It's a beautiful place.
I'm one of the dancers.
I'm sure I've seen Tom.
Tom's driving a lot of people.
Can you come?
That's a good idea.
No, it's not!
She says "you" to me.
Did she buy books?
Tom's in the hospital.
I don't need her.
Tom walked five minutes ago.
Everything's for her.
My house was just outside the station.
He's taking the house.
It's hard to please.
I wash my pen.
Get out of here!
That's what you're doing.
That's the way you did it.
It's not the people's fault or the people's fault, as well as innocence, it's not the people's fault, it's not the people's fault, it's the people's fault.
He's gone to the hospital.
The leaves on the shelves of the jelly.
He's in the grave.
I'm sure Tom's telling the truth.
I'll take my coffee in the morning.
He's in the same way.
What are you doing?
They didn't buy cereal.
I know you are.
He's good and he's good.
Don't talk about it, man!
What's the matter with you?
We're lost.
How about a dining room?
How come you weren't here?
Elves have their ears.
Doubts about the method, the method, the method.
Send me a catalog.
Do you know what she said?
They're renting an apartment.
Did you have any of your men before me?
One ounce weighs more than a word.
How's it going, how's it going?
Tom's in a towel.
Admiral is not pleased.
You didn't tell her that?
A bottle of wine is worth three.
You're the one who told us.
She's gonna have to be red.
She took off her coat and was ready for a short shot.
I'm a good teacher.
You're the one who speaks in riddles.
I've had a lot more fun.
It's a ghost.
Why would you do that?
You're the only one.
I'm a teacher.
The city is more beautiful than the other city.
I've taught you a lesson, and I'll share it with you.
It's a house, Tom's home.
We can't save Tom.
I was the one I didn't know.
They're pretty good.
How can you do this?
I've got a lot of jobs.
I'd like to talk to you tomorrow.
I don't know who I am.
It's beef, man.
Did you come back?
I'm not friends with her.
Mary said she wouldn't want to do that.
Do you know that God is dedicated to the temple?
Tom's on his own.
Tom didn't do it, you did.
I'm glad you're there.
I don't know about him.
The mayor of the house is the illusion of space and luxuries.
How can we find it?
They went to the bar.
Did I say that?
Tom wants a ride.
I don't like his humor.
There's a tree growing in front of the house.
She's a sloppy girl.
They spent all day on the beach.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That'll do us a favor.
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I
I want to do it.
I didn't order my car.
Where does she want to go?
That's what it's about.
He sent me.
You don't have to do that anymore.
Give me one chance.
I won't do it.
He wanted to go to the sea.
There was a ghost in the house.
Give me your shirt.
Go out and walk with the dog.
You weren't in the hospital.
Did she die?
He died when he died.
Two hours at home.
Did you translate from your brother?
I've been on the phone with FDA.
They got him.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The coin is a freedrichsdore in 1774.
Are you doing this?
Tom doesn't sing very well.
I don't want to go to Boston with Tom.
I told him that.
Have you seen anyone?
Hans is a German name.
I'm sorry, but I don't marry them.
I'm from Tennessee.
Tom was home all day.
Bring the table to the bar, please.
Tom said he saw Mary.
How old is your uncle?
Tom, did you eat?
I'm sorry for your beautiful little handkerchief.
"You're for him?" "No."
Did I give you the key?
Have you ever been in love with someone?
Tom shut the car down.
I need to talk to you.
Tom didn't go to the hospital.
I'm going.
Tom ran away from home.
It's my turn.
Get up, I'm coming with you.
It's a hundred miles away from Hebron.
Ice is on the run.
We didn't do it.
I'm under the Earth.
Is that the way to the hospital?
Tell me where she's going.
I want you to have one job.
Tom didn't know what was going to happen to him.
Let me send Tom.
Is that a stone in my garden?
She'll write a letter.
Tom took the mouse.
Napoléon is the one who's been forced to take care of them.
Do you think that's what you're doing?
The washing machine is a wonderful invention.
I'd like some hot chocolate.
The demand for telephone phones with portrait portraits and the words of the government -- the fact that they're talking about tens of times of telephone calls by the government -- is simple: for the Communistgogossums, there's a pony for them.
It's our secret.
You don't have your secrets.
You're the one who did what you said.
Tom's got a camera, you want it.
We've got you.
I think it would have been better if you hadn't.
No, I'm not suffering from asthma, I'm groaning about it!
She didn't have a pencil.
I said it on the bus.
I'll have breakfast.
He's fine.
You've already left.
We're on our way.
Tom didn't send me.
I don't have a book.
He's out of home in France.
I want something from you, but I don't.
I'm going through something I'm talking about.
Remove it, please.
I wish I hadn't thought to say anything.
Does Tom have an older brother?
Of course you're not coming.
He hasn't written to me in a long time.
How can I make you feel?
What would you do without us?
There's a positive way to do it.
There's something you could have done with Tom.
It's clear night, and it's clearly visible.
You're a friend of yours?
Tom and Mary don't come.
He didn't sell the house.
Let me buy you some.
I told him.
Tango is a dance dance in the country.
You didn't do it, Tom.
She was three times in prison.
He's got it. He's got it.
You're just as good as an American.
He's pretty good at it.
Is that Tom's dog?
You put your hand in it.
We'll have a tour tomorrow, and the tour will be canceled.
Does he have a dog?
We did it.
Are you from Africa?
I'm going to put my dream into the world, and I'm going to put my heart on it, and I'm going to put my heart on it, and I'm going to put my heart on it.
But the point is, at the end of the battle, the ruler will prevail, and the entrance into the law will be.
We're at home.
I got a plate of peanut soup.
You want to go to New Year's Eve?
She showed us a girl.
Who's on the wire?
My cat's got a lot of nausea.
We'll be sent to the hospital.
I don't like it, it's hot.
Is it temperature?
I don't know what your problem is.
And his father and mother died.
I'm on my way.
I've done it.
Are all the cats sick?
Tom put his wallet on the table.
It's in the foretold scenario.
That's the one I told you about.
Don't go to school.
I'm going to stay.
He's on his way.
Don't eat too much.
Tom doesn't like it.
I thought I knew everything.
Jane took the ice cream rod.
I'm going to the hospital.
I've got a call for you.
I'm not leaving because of you.
I've been married to over six years of age.
I want an apartment with a sea view.
I don't wear glasses.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I read it from the books.
I'm glad I sent you.
She never took his writing.
Be careful.
He'll let you throw away the cats.
They're bringing soldiers to their teeth to control the capital.
If it were the country, it wasn't the country, Tom was telling the truth.
I've seen you do it.
I've been there a lot.
I want a lot of money.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

That book was a year old book.
Are you here?
You've done it.

I'm going to talk to you.
I'm sorry about the towels.
Shh!
I know Tom's secret.
I'm waiting for you. Are you ready?
It's not a secret.

That's what you're doing.
I wish I could give you something.
It's not my fault!
Did I say that?

Tom really did.
"I don't understand," said Tom.
It's the same thing.
I've been talking to her through one of the papers.
Mary told Tom that he was, that John was.
Someone was at my office.
It doesn't mean anything to her.
Mary is the kind of girl I know.
Tom's been waiting for you.
I was about to leave the hospital under the cover of the night.
Society or barbarity.
You've done it!
Nurse's got the wound bandaged.
Don't look, don't look, don't look what I'm talking about!
You're not welcome.

It's a bullet in my leg.
Do you want to have a breakfast this day?
We've got to go.
Do you have any names?

He's a big swimmer.
She got up early.
You want Moscow?
I don't have any.
I want to do my job.
Our house is in the village.
I sat down.
Tom's neck's got a neck.
There's no such thing as to be worth anything.
I'll take care of it.
She stayed standing.
Did you do it?
You've got to go straight!
She's a good girl.
What are you doing around here?
She visited her aunt.
If I could afford it, I could buy it.
The sea is gray.
His loud voice attracted me.
Tom couldn't find a job.
I can't let her do it.

Tom is Canadian.
I want to swim.
He's got a white cat.
Let's sit in the back.
My brother's one year old, and he's married.
I'm going to ask you for it.
That's what I'm doing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
But I was a fool, that I should do this.
Have a nice day.
I know what she's doing.
It's snow.
Tomorrow is my day.
There are two foreign women.
I loved it.
She's got a job and she's got a job.
Does Tom have anything against tomorrow night sitting with our people?
Or they can't, or they can't.
I don't want you to go to Boston.
He's got it and he's got it.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom's a student.
Smoking in bed.
There's only one chance.
Maria was at the very moment.
I don't swear at any office.
It's on the outskirts of the ancient city.

It wasn't that hard.
You've come from Boston.
You'll understand that I can't comment on it.
That's Julius.
They went to Paris.
Can you track the geography of the GDR?
You've done more than that.
My husband's been in prison for three years.
I'm coming.
You didn't tell him.
The police fired pepper gas and clubs.
We need to make our plan.
She told her husband to take her husband to the hospital.
You don't have to hope, you don't have to do anything.
Dad, do I have a hand?
You don't know where I was?
He was five o'clock.
What's the matter with you?
Is it my fault?
I can't stay in my own office.
I'm talking to you.
I'm sorry for my hard work, sir.
Mary massaging my shoulders.
What's the matter with you?
They're all so bad.
You're the one with the hair.
I'm sorry, do you know what time it is?
He made a good word for me.
I see what it says, or do you think I'm not?
Tom was home.
Tom bought his car.
Don't you drive?
It's not a big deal.
I've got a book for you.
You're the one who's good.
Everyone shouted.
I often look for words in a dictionary.
We can't do much more for him.
I'm a swimmer than he is.
It's the same thing.
It wasn't!
I've all been married.
Soldiers have taken over.
I can help you.
What's he holding in?
All you have to do is get the floor cleaned up.
Just a second...
You'll have to listen to him.
Are you writing?
Hey, you're a singer.
The bus to the museum?
But there's not much about it.
I'll be right back.

I'm going to put my house in England until it warms up.
Let me through.
Do you want to go to Volleyball?
He stood there, and laid his trust on me, saying that I would be free.
We can't go to the Esperanto, but we can't do it in German or German. We can't do it.
They sent Robert Bob.
I told him to do it.
I'm proud of you!
Tom's not Mary's mystery.
He's looking for her spelling.
They're both blonde.
I think I'm good for it.
She's talking, she's saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't have any.
We like to talk.
I wish we were friends.
Come here.
I'm out of here.
We're fighting in the city.
It's hard to teach people who don't.
She's going home.
She translated her office.
Tom did it.
I wish I hadn't missed it!
I'm going to Boston.
I think we can do that.
I already paid for it.
Give Tom a hug.
I'm a member of your staff.
He was drunk.
Did you get up?
Mary threw Tom away.
We were asked.
I've been studying so much from you.
Don't you tell him?
Mary said that she was the only one we could both have.
I've got to go.
Take the umbrella with you on the guard, and you'll get it.
Payments and fees.
He's got me. He's got me.
Learn the same day!
Don't you think it's my fault?
She's on her way.
I want to stay.
You want milk?
Tom's repairing his house.
He looks like he doesn't hurt me.
Tom's in?
Are you going to tell Tom?
I'll be on the train in ten minutes.
Tom put his finger on Masha.
I'm going to become a carpenter.
He spoke to the police.
Did you send a bus expresspress to your office?
He's taken over his office.
You need a man.
Have you read the book yet?
I'd love to be in the hospital.
I know your apartment.
I wish you'd done it.
Mary is no longer a good man.
Tom and Mary were at the meeting.
- "Thom Young." - "Yung is this?" - "Yung is this?" - "Yumu."
She was angry and silent.
Don't you tell him?
I can't find my girlfriend.
On the back of the chair, there's a man hanging on the back of the chair.
You want to go to New Year's Eve?
I'm pretty good.
Thursday night we go to the hospital.
That's what I'd say.
We can talk about it.
Tom grew a mustache.
It's a little short.
The map was productive until the 6th of 2006.
"Where are we going?" "Where are we going?" "Where are we going?" "Where are we going?" "Where are we going?" "Where are we going?"
We're going to buy a girl's hand.
Tom was home all night.
Get on the road, Tom!
The apple fell to the ground.
Can you give me a prescription?
Don't cry.
Are you so distrustful?
He gave me his phone number.
Do you think we're going out tonight?
That's what I'm talking about.
I got to the hospital. I'm on my way.
I'd kill you if I could.
I think you'll be fine without me.
He doesn't come to us?
Did you talk to me at the hospital?
What's with the boots?
She took him for a favor.
It's the weather that's on the road.
What are you doing with me?
You're in prison.
It's about ten.
We've got a soccer game in May.
Tom has toothache.
He's telling the truth.
We're going to have to do it this way, it's going to be as safe as possible, and it's not going to be a problem.
What's the number of this letter?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't like cold coffee.
Are you waiting for someone?
