I'm not in you.
He's got dogs.
There were nine girls on the table.
I didn't know you had any.
How did you get into Tom?
Why does he hate me?
You're teasing him.
He's been with her.
Tom's a species, he didn't.
I think I'm going to quit smoking.
Stay with them.
The accident almost cost him his life.
He's out of the way.
We're home.
You didn't return those books?
I saw him at the club.
I'm not.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
You won't understand me.
Are you a mystery?
You're just running away from your problems.
Outside.
Did you meet her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed.
Eat while you're hot.
That's why they'll wait three hours.
What are you doing to me?
Tom, Mary's an idiot.
I told Tom to take me.
I couldn't take everything.
I didn't know you were coming either.
I'm gonna run into Tom in Boston.
Tom's a painter.
Tom didn't know that Mary loved a job.
I told Tom that you were here.
Tom's staying in Boston with Mary.
What's the joke?
I wanted more.
Tom is our husband.
Are you sure that Tom needs to be treated?
I can't just use it.
She's taking a bicycle to school.
I'll pay you!
Did you drive?
I've been working all day.
They're peers.
A coin fell under the table.
It's empty.
My place.
Don't think I'm not coming.
You got it. You got it.
Tom risked saving Mary.
The camel caravan was moving slowly.
You're in the midst of ignorance.
I've got Tom's room.
Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I'm not going to take you.
I knew Tom wouldn't lose.
Tom told Mary he wanted to go.
Why are you grinning?
Tom didn't tell you how he got to it.
Did I tell you I was allergic to peanuts?
I know you're old.
I won't show him any more.
Tom won't run his house.
I didn't want to hurt Tom.
I'll teach you.
I've got some.
He's sticking to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom will suffocate Mary.
I've done it.
Tom won't let you do more than that.
Cosmonauts wear suits.
Algeria is buying an artillery at the hospital.
Should I tell Tom what happened?
I've got you.
Is Tom in trouble?
It was shocking.
She's empty.
Tom's Mary's telegraph.
Are you in this?
We slept under the sky.
Don't lock it.
Are you free?
Tom wasn't the one who did that?
I went to work.
Who are you?
I want to talk to you about it.
What's he doing?
Smell is one of the five.
What have you got?
They got him.
Tom on duty.
Tom's got something from us.
He didn't touch him at all.
Have you come up with a name for the newborn?
I want you to help me with this.
I didn't.
I had a cold on him right now.
I'm not going to Ukraine, but I'm not going to Ukraine.
I made you a breakfast.
I didn't think you'd tell me that.
I've seen Tom all day.
A hump tomb will kill.
The soup is so hot that it's got it.
Is she so popular?
They've reported it.
Did you hurt yourself so badly?
I don't understand them.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I took good care of them.
Destyll's water is tasteless.
Father's in the garden.
Harry has a day at the supermarket.
There's not much I can do.
I told them I was in the shoes.
Tom said he was exhausted.
I'm a firefighter.
I just wanted to tell you that I did.
Tom's with him.
You'll be out tonight?
Tom went to his bedroom.
I knew Tom the most.
You're hopeless!
Tom was good at the violin.
You're not welcome.
The year is Rabbit's year.
Tom took a bath in front of the meeting.
I can take you home.
What are you doing?
Please write what I'm gonna say.
That's what I'm doing.
I can't take Tom.
I don't have books.
Tennis is the first kind of government, Tom's good.
Go to the fire.
Thank you.
I was tired, and I fell asleep.
Tom is my singer.
I love you.
He's the guy.
Mary didn't want to go to Halloween costume, and she's gonna dress like an amish.
Tom's got a hooker.
Tom's been here for three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to go.
You knew Tom better than I did.
They're people like us. They're not people like us.
I won't do that anymore, I promise.
I go shopping this morning.
The baby's coming.
Tom took the document.
Tom didn't slow down.
I don't want Tom anywhere without me.
I'm looking for how you do it.
He's got you guys in math.
There's a hole in the road.
He's new.
It's been a long time.
The doorkeeper of the bank is in trouble.
When you're done, you're going to have a good time.
I'm the one who's got you.
I'll be in winter.
How do you know what Tom's gonna tell you about it?
We're close.
Are you sure we're doing this?
All of us are wasting our lives.
He poured himself one cup.
I'm going to take you to the hospital and make sure you've been punished by the police, you'll be on your way tomorrow.
Jenny, salt.
She spent all her time.
Tom slept in the barn.
You're gonna fuck yourself up.
Tom was the only one.
Have you ever seen Mary's handkerchiefs?
You're going to school.
You're a priest?
So I'm not asking you to ask me.
You should go to Boston.
I'm so happy.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your life?
I see you and Tom.
I'm good.
From this point on, there's a lot of evidence in his plan.
This is the house I live in.
I go to school with him.
I can see you're not.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I went to Harvard.
You're like a record.
I can't take him alone.
It's Tom's office.
Jesus, taken by demons into a herd of pigs, was under the law of uncleanness.
I'm the captain.
I think we're gonna be fine.
We had to come.
I was wrong.
It's my day.
We need to tell people that they're doing it.
It's inexpensive, I'll buy it.
I told Tom what I needed to do.
She almost drowned.
Good job.
Are you wet?
I won't let you do that.
Tom took me with you.
Who are you taking her to?
I don't want to go.
I went to France.
Tom let go of me.
The missing boy was on his way.
I've got some reflexes.
Tell me what it looked like.
She'll probably refuse him because he won't.
Did you pee?
I know you're on them.
I'm sure I can help you.
Have you heard about it?
She put a white tablecloth on her desk.
That day I was at home because I was at home.
Is there a pharmacy here?
I read it.
Tell me if I can find it.
Is that what Tom's been doing to me?
I went to the police station and told them my car was stolen.
We can do that.
It's been a while.
The cats in the Ancient Church are a priest.
Can I speak?
I'm on my way.
Why don't you find someone else who needs your help?
Tom put a wet towel on Mary's forehead.
He's got his left hand.
Is she Italian?
We've done it.
It's the city with the city.
Dan didn't want to be trapped.
Could you give me something about yourself?
Did you do it?
She didn't see the books in her office.
You're a little depressed.
Don't forget to tell me.
Cats have a hairdress.
I wouldn't do that.
Fix it, please.
A bag of ice on your butt, you know.
I could have given you the city.
I know that Tom is here.
You're not doing the job.
Let's go for one cookie.
I'm sleeping!
You're an idiot.
Tom's in the park.
I didn't think you'd be there.
"Who are you in?" "Argents."
Are you crazy?
I can do this more than you can.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
The zone's gone.
Tom's got his room in order.
Did you complain?
I don't like Tom.
That's why I did it.
Someone bit him.
Did you do something?
Tom said he wanted to see us in front of the hospital.
But I don't have a job.
How do you like Mary?
There was fear on his face.
You're not gonna tell her, I'll tell her.
Can you keep a secret?
My mother died in prison.
London is the capital of the country.
Her mother was a singer.
Did we get her?
I'm asking Tom.
You did it yourself.
Tom told me he was taken.
Tom, he won't tell you.
Something happened.
That's not the key.
Ask Alex.
That's all I have to say.
Bring her down.
I was just there, I told you that.
We've got to go.
Smell it.
Tom awakened from sleep.
You are.
What are you doing with him?
I don't know, you're the one who told me that.
I'm sure I'll take him to Paris.
Are you sure you're okay with this?
There's no way.
They got you.
I did it, I did it.
We're going to send them a handkerchief.
You didn't do it, you didn't do it.
Go left and right before crossing the road.
Tom was a friend.
I didn't know her.
We've done it and we've done it.
What are you and Tom doing?
I'm not happy.
As often as that happens, Mike's late for the reception.
Tom told me Mary had a girlfriend.
We won't let that happen.
You fools are breaking the law, you're breaking the law.
That's not true.
John spoke so loud that I took him to the hospital.
Tom's gone.
I didn't give it to Tom.
There's a lot of rumors going on.
I know you're rich.
Bill put a hundred on the table.
He served in the navy.
Who sent you?
Tom wrinkled his nose.
You wouldn't have done that.
I'm not lying.
You knew them better than I did.
We don't want it, we don't want it.
Is it your fault?
I'm not gonna do this.
He got in the car and left.
That's what I'm doing.
I'm looking for my phone.
He's been sharing soup with me.
All things are wrong, but all things are wrong.
I don't have any.
That's the way it is.
Pray for me, Tom.
We haven't met anyone.
Tom's been in pain for three days.
You seem to know everything.
Hope is great.
It's a girl, she's coming.
I'll give you some.
You said it was coming.
What did he buy?
Don't let me do that.
What are you doing?
Tom's on the bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've already met Tom.
Tom and I are in the company.
Get him in the car!
I've never seen her before.
Am I the only one who thinks so?
All of you, Tom's, have a hooker.
She gives him everything he asks.
Is that what you're talking about?
I'm getting angry.
Do you have that kind of thing?
It's legal.
Do you have your name?
We can't afford to buy a job.
It's a problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary last night.
Tom made the sound of a washing tank in the toilet.
I went to prison.
Tell him I'm pregnant.
They've already gone.
Did you get your car?
You haven't been around all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're pretty good.
You're a moth.
There's a little sugar in the bag.
That's what I'm doing.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What are you talking about?
Don't get involved in other people's business.
Who's in the blue shirt?
Tom has an accent.
I don't have to buy a dictionary.
Are you so surprised?
Carrots are for you.
I want you to give me all of this.
She's good for you.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She kept herself for her daughter.
We're gonna talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom shaved.
Half a third.
The lion is strong.
I thought he'd come here.
She said she didn't make the rules.
That's one of the guys.
The kid's got his hat fixed.
Shall we go for a walk?
He's a math guy.
I'm glad you told me about her.
He's got cats.
I know you're good at banjos.
Have you read them?
I told Tom that I wouldn't take him.
Tom's sorry he left Boston.
I don't like the store.
Tom speaks English.
I don't think I paid for it anymore.
Aren't you going to sing with us?
Tom's in with the kids.
I took the train.
I don't like it.
Do you like a fantastic girl?
I got her.
Just tell him I'll call.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house is behind the hill.
I didn't get up early.
Hands!
Mary, are you looking good?
I've killed my life.
Did you think I'd tell them?
Tom 20 is pressed.
I'm sure you're dealing with this.
The way that Mary gave Tom a glass of wine and then a restaurant, there was a dead silence.
You're two years old for Tom.
We got them.
Tom's gonna do the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary.
You're not, are you?
I think you're getting a loan.
Tom's father, staying in the hospital, doesn't write to Tom.
It's expensive.
I haven't heard from him for a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom didn't swim.
I thought it was time for us to leave.
It's all right.
Tom's so easy to get out of his way.
Jenny, just as much as I do.
There you go.
I'm not with him.
That's lucky.
It was so dark that I could feel it.
The U.S. Army's transporters?
Is she your teacher?
Sing it once, Tom.
What are you talking about from me?
Tom said he didn't do it anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young people go to pots in winter.
I own a French leadership.
That sounds good, that's not true.
Take it there, take it.
Tom had to tell Mary.
Are you all right with me?
Tom Mary.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of you.
I told you it was.
It's all so personal.
Tom's gone.
You've done a lot to me.
Are you in the middle of it?
Take the truck out.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary that I have her keys.
You guys bought it, didn't you?
Canada is a family of ice hockey.
It's the brain that's got the organ.
They'd be fine.
Your boy's good.
The thief broke through the window.
Spiders are the best.
I want to know what this is.
No mustache like soup without salt.
Are you going to talk to him?
Who's in charge?
It's been a long time.
I saw the car hit me.
We took them.
Tom and Mary.
I'm tired to death.
Are you crazy?
Is she okay?
He misses her.
Tell me I'm right.
We've got a castle in front of us.
Tom's tickling her.
Six before you go.
I was on Grandpa's tomb.
Tom couldn't believe someone wanted to kill him.
Tom didn't talk to Mary.
I've seen people eating out of a tank.
I think Tom got me.
She took me in.
Tom and Mary stopped crying.
I've been talking to Tom.
Tom's finger.
Did you get the contract?
I told Tom he'd talk to a lawyer.
Did they get on the wrong bus?
Tom's going home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of girlfriends.
It's a neighborhood.
Tom's an anti-Semitic.
What's your side?
Tom doesn't like it, they're taking him.
Interestingly, when Anszika Agurbash said Neclav, could she say that he was going to be president?
There's yogurt in the fridge.
Can you tell us what it is?
Tom's on the move.
Thomas's in there.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he's really incapacitated.
Tom wasn't in his hospital?
You didn't take him?
They're the ones who've been murdered.
I wouldn't want to.
Tom wants popcorn.
My restaurant's with me.
John's an unborn, he's been doing a lot of work.
Tom took Mary's money.
Tom is my wife.
Who's that guy?
Keep you away from the pond.
We'll talk about the night before.
I'll fix it.
They're not doing it.
Shut up!
I knew the Jacksons.
You don't have to lie in front of me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three granddaughters.
He wants peanut butter.
You're so lucky.
Tom's gonna die a little bit.
I got him.
He's got the bait out of him.
I'm staying in my house and I don't know how to be comfortable.
I'm waiting for Tom to tell me what to do.
I'm staying with him tonight.
One plus one is two.
It's red.
Everything is endless.
I'm not ready for this.
Thank you for that.
What did you mean by that?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Did you tell me about Tom?
Can I have a word with Tom?
Don't make that noise.
Thomas's?
We eat at six.
The deer became a lion.
Tom didn't come.
Tom's gone a long way.
I've done all I could for Tom's sake.
Try to persuade us to do so.
Are you with us?
Think about it.
Tom's alive.
It's been lying in the water for ten years, but it's not going to be a crocodile.
Tom's a kind that doesn't know what Mary says to him.
I've seen it happen.
I don't think I'm the one.
I'm good.
My apartment's on the front.
How do you know you're so good?
I'll take care of it.
It's ego!
So you bought it?
He's a man, he's a man, he's a man, he's a man, and she's a man.
Wisdom comes with a child.
What did you tell me?
There was a lot of stuff in this year.
He's overreacting.
Everything seems like it.
Tom told Mary she was telling the truth.
You didn't take your daughter?
I'm gonna go for a walk.
You've been with me.
It's a dictionary for us.
"How far is it?" "Five minutes."
Take it to her.
Mary's been doing all the work for her.
Tom got on his bike and picked him up.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I do it now?
I don't want to go to school.
I want to keep going.
I live in Mexico.
I took him to ten.
Tom tells him what's in his head.
Did you find out?
How do you say "before"?
It's not that expensive.
What's with your computer?
We both did.
I'm doing fine.
We're not going to let you down.
Are you sure Tom's swimming?
How do you spend your job?
Mary likes to hang out with the ladies.
It's often that you're in the middle of a church.
She's got it.
I thought we'd talked about that before.
If I were to kill myself, I'd have to kill myself.
I feed the cat the first day and night.
Hold your mouth, don't you?
You've done everything you can to put anything in the code.
I can't bite, I don't have teeth.
I think you've done some business.
We used to have a fight.
What brings Tom?
That's what I'm asking.
Tom told me he was here.
That's what I'm doing.
I'll tell you more about him.
Did I have any?
You're upstairs.
We're going home, Bill.
She was sitting on a chair and reading the magazine.
I've been here since the moment.
If I knew it, I'd tell you.
This is the house where he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to you.
Eat my chocolate?
It's painted in the house, it's bigger.
I've got a quote.
I don't know that you know her.
Did you get that?
Is your dog yours?
You gave Tom more money.
You didn't tell me what Tom said.
Tom's on his way to Boston.
You're not helping me?
I'm on the phone with the sixth subtitles.
I'm leaving.
Tom's good.
He blames others, he blames himself.
Are you on a banjo?
Tom went to Mary and hugged her.
"Are you coming back?" "Everything's out of the way."
Did you get turtles?
Is that what you're doing?
Yours.
It took me three years to get home.
I was very proud.
Don't talk to me like that.
We've found out if we're doing this.
Tom didn't want to, we're on his behalf.
I suddenly realized what I was doing.
She said she was going to die.
Did you go to the hospital?
I need her.
Tom, of course, will win.
What would you want, Santa?
Tom doesn't want me?
What's your adventurer spirit?
Why were you mad at me?
You can go, you can go.
I see you've already arrived.
I'm sorry you're right.
It's not my cat.
Captain's got people killed.
Sit there.
He didn't do it.
Tom's gone.
Tom's with her.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard. It's like a man, it's like a man, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman, it's like a woman.
Let me talk to her.
I did it, but I didn't succeed.
I thought you were Canadian.
Are you sitting on a chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy this.
I didn't see you in the hospital.
Put him on the shelf.
I thought you took someone.
On the way, we're going to have to take care of the police.
You fooled us all.
I don't think Tom has a gun or a stew.
He loves you.
It's absolutely impossible that you're taking me, that I believe in what you don't believe!
I think that would have been the case.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I'm sorry.
I've taken your initiative.
What do you mean?
He's going to trust me.
Tom's closed?
She's right, she's got me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom, I don't think you've been seen.
I'm worried about Tom.
What did I do with her?
Take it.
Are you doing something?
I'll have you read it to me in the boiler.
Why would a gentleman like to be on his own?
What did you say to Tom?
Are you talking about it?
Is this about you?
Tom's got you in the conference room.
In Dad's house, you don't say you're a gangster.
He paid him twice.
Because of the strike, I'm going to take my stand.
I don't know who you are.
You're going to Boston?
What's the lyrics of a song?
Mary likes to tease her brother.
The law is on the table.
That's why I had to find him. He's gone.
Tom was with Mary this morning.
The publication was on the day of the professor's day.
You've got a phone ringing you six times while you were in the shower.
She did it for him.
It's not a bird.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't have them.
It's just superstition.
Tom's gone.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Your shoes are on.
You've got a day to go.
Count it.
I don't like that.
Tom was married to Mary.
It's just a picture that I downloaded in France.
I think that's why they're less than that.
Did you take care of him?
He's all for the office.
You give me a job.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom didn't just go.
I'm a lover.
It doesn't look like you guys are.
Deadline's talking about it.
You're very interested in me.
You got those men over there?
Tom didn't say a word.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Have you had lunch yet?
Tom and Mary are for a few hours.
I want you to come with us.
He saved her.
You're going to press that button, you're going to hit it.
Did you get your clothes?
I've given you my name.
Tell me more about them.
Did you hear rumors?
I'd show you how it is.
I'm going to get Tom to come.
You've got a label.
Mom didn't lose me.
We could go for a walk.
She was in the middle of the day.
I can't hurt our daughter in Mexico.
He set up a tent for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I shouted at you.
Are you doing your job?
I know what's important to you.
They all knew it.
We've got to go.
I'm not doing it anymore.
I'm hungry.
I live close to you.
Tom's in charge.
Is Tom not with you?
I'm going back to Australia.
People kill them.
They took Tom away from life's cooking.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
I'm in charge of it.
What am I doing here?
Tom and Mary have a lot of things.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We're all about each other.
I'm not happy.
Tom took you.
Tom's in the back.
I'm in charge of a lawyer.
It's warm, it's warm, it's safe.
He's got me.
Did you tell Tom?
Your wife is a lady.
He wouldn't do that.
I'm tired of the time.
The baby's in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss?
She didn't see us do it.
He's been gone for two days.
Tom had breakfast.
We'll be home soon.
Did you go to Boston?
I know Tom's with Mary.
Food!
Did you help Tom wash up?
That's a lot of stuff.
It was real.
I love myself.
What does your son want to be, and he'll grow up?
I'm good.
Don't do that to the one who's in the middle of the business.
I'm not just giving you this.
What have you done?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Come down here.
Did I get her?
I've told you all about it.
Tom didn't realize it was.
I blew it.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read a book.
Where's Tom?
Tom gave me both counsel.
What are you doing with me?
That's right.
Tom said he didn't want to go.
She's been fighting for him in the last seven years.
I can't write a dictionary.
Give me that box.
His son died in a foreign home.
It's mine.
I know that Tom Mary.
I didn't have it, I didn't have it.
Mary told him to give it to him.
Many numbers from “person ” are “people, ” not“ persons. ”
It's in the first place.
You've done it!
I think Tom had to stay in Boston.
Did you take him?
Tom told me how she felt.
Tom, I'm in Boston.
Tom didn't want to drive a car.
We're a teacher.
Tom's got you.
Everyone has weaknesses.
You're well paid.
Tom didn't eat a meal.
This book seemed interesting to me.
Hundreds of people are in and out.
I guess I'm gonna kill you.
Did you do that?
Tom screamed and you ran away.
It's soup.
There's a lot of stuff in this place.
He talks a lot about her.
She put a lot of sugar in her coffee.
You didn't know I was in Boston?
Tom was so surprised.
They tried hard.
I've already done this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living as humans, living on the full, from the point of view of the Galilean dialect of the Aramaic Republic of Hebrew, showed the indisposition of any sacred entity, the prayer especially draws closer to God.
Tom changed his mind.
It's my fault.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So they paid 300 for it.
You're not the only one.
I know Tom did.
The forecast didn't take place.
Tom obviously didn't.
I'll have Tom prepare you something.
Let's get Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read the book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my job!
I saw him drinking in the shower.
You remind me of the young me.
Tom's on duty.
I've been busy.
I've been on the piano for a while.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom's on the move.
I'll tell you what I'm doing.
Tom told me to stay with him.
It's private.
Have you checked in yet?
She's got her head in her head at the moment.
I've got a lot of money in it.
You're not in the hospital?
A pound is a pound.
I wouldn't be with him anymore.
It's a lot of stuff.
It's hard.
You killed me.
Tell her I'm pregnant.
Tom seems busy.
And I'm happy to be with you.
I'm sorry I broke up with you.
I can't do it to Tom.
Is that my book?
Washing is routine.
Who's in your hospital?
Don't give Tom my phone.
I've already checked who I'm talking to.
I wish I knew what to tell them.
Tom's gonna miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He took a job at Oxford.
He's got a fact from me.
Did you save me?
He snores in his sleep.
Your browser?
Tom's on Mary's voice.
You're not even on me.
Tom's lazy, I'll tell you that.
Come on, stop falling.
Grandfather said it was days like days.
That's not what I told her.
I want to live in Mexico.
They couldn't do it.
What did you do to her?
The day is near, and the people who have sent you to your homes have not killed themselves, in the Theatre, the Masks are rehearsing a whole pantomimum.
I've got tents on the road.
Tell your men to do it.
There's a secret in this place.
Mike's got a job in Florida.
We've both been laughing.
We've got three chairs.
I'm sorry.
I've got a friend who's going to the hospital.
Tom's got a lot of energy.
You're not coming tomorrow?
We've been able to meet each other.
Someone said something, but I don't.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I don't care about them.
Tom managed to get to the hospital.
I sat next to Tom.
You've got a loud voice.
Have you ever been such a man?
I think that's what I'm offering you.
Tom, you were in the middle of it.
It's not a god of science.
Tom told me Mary was taking drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
You don't have to tell her.
I'm afraid it will.
You want a beer?
Have you seen him?
The poor cat was starving to death.
I'm going to take care of it, I think I'm going to do it!
My name is blue.
I'm in.
You're not what you're talking about.
A football player hit a ball.
It's a good book.
Tom didn't say anything.
I didn't know Tom didn't.
Putting an atomic nucleus on the attraction of the nucleus.
You're so wrong!
Tom's got his bag.
Everybody's on my feet.
Tom was an alien.
Don't help me, I want it myself.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
The hotel gave me 8,000 yen per room.
I stopped chasing fashion.
Tom's allergic.
I know you.
I don't know exactly what I'm doing.
Did she do that?
Tom's got it?
I'm going to work.
Tom's in the kitchen, the dishes.
Temperature is about three degrees.
Tom took Mary to the office.
Tom won't ask me to do that.
I want to get on him.
I won't tell you.
The bus was on the way.
Where are you going?
Is that wonderful?
I've got a hangover.
Tom wasn't with Mary.
Get out of here.
It's a good idea.
It's my fault.
You can't do this to us.
His words made me sad.
I know what I'm doing.
What can we do?
I know what Tom needed to do.
Say hello to her from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom was shocked.
Tom was good.
Did you take Tom in?
I've got to go.
Who was your son?
I've seen it in the store.
Peace.
I'm dreaming.
That's why there's no action, no self.
I'm from Sidzuoki.
Tom saw everything in his backyard.
Saturday is the day it is.
I wonder what happened to her.
The bus leaves in minutes.
He told me he was doing it.
He gave him a book.
I'm sorry I'm with you.
She didn't give it to me.
Yes, sir.
He wrote it to his parents.
I'm happy with what's there.
What are you doing?
The postman is sweet.
I want to see if Tom and Mary have a job.
Tom wouldn't have my advice.
Did you say something to Tom?
You didn't do it?
How can I with weight?
I think we're going to send the guy we're going to take.
What's our business?
We're not here.
They've got it.
There's an organ in this cathedral.
I don't think you're right.
Did you get it?
Did you see me come in?
Get me off the street from the traffic light.
Tom killed the tiger.
I haven't seen anyone with me.
Is it rusty flour?
It's cold.
Do you like it?
You have your character.
You're not healthy.
Did I miss something interesting?
I have to tell him myself.
The audience took a ride.
You don't mean me.
I've got an ankle.
You like a photographer, don't you?
He's a knight without fear, and he's a coward.
They hate women.
I don't have any change.
Tom's gone.
What's up with you?
Go away!
You overestimate him.
Did you get that back?
Tom slept at the hospital.
Are you sure you're doing this?
I'll take care of myself.
Tom's been alive.
Hawaii is my mother.
Tom was a great fan of hockey.
Who was this guy?
Are you in the choir?
You were home tonight?
I was homeless three times.
She said she wanted to go.
The prices will go down.
I'm glad Tom didn't.
I didn't do it.
That wasn't me.
Don't blame yourself.
What are you talking about?
Tom's yelling at Mary.
That's my friend.
Don't leave it in the hospital.
I don't know what's in there.
Tom said Mary was in the hospital.
Did she take you?
Tom was in '13.
You're perceptive.
I'll take care of them, I'll take care of them, I'll take care of them, I'll take care of them.
I'm sorry they took him on the rack.
You won't have any.
I'm going to spend time with her.
Come on in.
I'll take a dog, bark in the kitchen.
He told me he wanted to get out of here.
Do you want to go?
You and I both agree that it won't happen.
I thought you had them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back.
It's not a word we're talking about.
Tom's been accused of being a steward.
You're just running away from problems.
The courtyard is like a garden without a garden.
I'm the only one.
She's got it, she's got it.
I'm with this guy.
I put bait on the hook.
Don't leave your points on the table!
We sold our souls for it.
You're out tonight, aren't you?
The wind's coming.
I got her.
I know it's important.
I'm eating an apple.
Tom learns as carefully as they do.
I'm not hungry.
It's food for soldiers.
What happens when they catch us?
I can put a box in the box.
I'm going to clean up my bedroom.
He's got a lot of money.
Tom had a hard time.
I'm dead.
Did you know that Tom was there?
I'm glad you're telling me your name.
Tom didn't tell me anything.
There's no such thing as Bill.
Do we have it?
I knew I could trust you!
Tom put wood in the fire.
"Love didn't kill you."
What did the boy say?
I bought all the stuff I had.
It looks like a guy.
Let me give you my phone number.
It was my fault.
Tom died a year ago.
I knew you were coming back.
Books of books.
Are we in yet?
Neither Tom nor Mary went to Boston.
Did you suck?
If I had one, I'd buy a computer.
Tom's gone?
She went to Paris.
Tom's in the hospital?
Let us know.
Tom nodded and headed for the door.
That was the best I could do.
Try to prove that I'm wrong.
I told you to go to the hospital.
You've got a problem?
He couldn't do it because of the company.
Let me do it like that.
Or we'll take her!
Tom thought Mary wouldn't sell out.
I think Tom can do it.
There's a lot of riddles in her.
Wouldn't you like some salt?
Tom and Mary are healthy.
It's an apple that's rotten.
Tom said he didn't have a license.
Boston is Tom’s city.
I'm sorry I got someone.
Have you heard of it?
What do you think we're doing?
I'll talk about you for the first day until I'm gone.
That was the rate of the bet.
The thought that she's the only one, come on.
The river's not too bad.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I followed them.
Do you really love her?
He's given me no one.
He was dark green.
He's coming.
Who's that?
I'm sorry, Tom.
We've had it.
I gave it to him, but I was busy.
Tom puts everything on the table.
I'll get the glasses.
I'm going to surrender.
The poor man took their company.
It's all right that there's something in the capital of the capital.
I'm careful.
I'm taking a ride.
Did you get a towel?
I've got his keys.
I don't think Tom has Mary's phone number.
Do we have a chance?
I knew I had to stay home.
He spoke English.
Tom got on a bus going to Boston.
When she fell, she bruised her elbow.
I'm sick.
Tom and I are.
Are you rich?
They're calling you.
I'm proud of you.
She doesn't like my manner of speaking.
Mary wants one thing.
I don't care if you're with me.
I'd like a boss.
Tom didn't drive to Boston.
It's a prediction.
She's very young.
Did you find yourself in Tom's shoes?
Tom said he was a colorist.
How's your father?
Did they say yes?
That car looks angry.
You're a doctor, aren't you?
Are you my friend?
She asked him for a job.
Did Luna light up?
I couldn't understand what Tom said.
You can't do that anymore.
Tom, that's what I'm talking about.
Let's think about it.
I know what Tom wants, you guys.
Tom said it wasn't about the invasion.
Are you with me?
Tom wasn't here until he was nine years old.
I'm a quailer.
She's going to Muhosransk.
Those people who don't take me, they don't take me.
Is this your arrival in Australia?
The owls are wise.
Tom asked for some water.
The loser won with a break in the middle of the nets.
I can't talk to her because I'm busy.
It's two-and-a-half pounds.
How many animals are there in the zoo?
She's my wife.
The temperature is at least a factor.
Dad, you don't have a name, you don't have a name!
What's he talking about?
I haven't seen Tom in a while.
Tom said he didn't want to go.
Is Tom on the road?
There are no direct flights to Bologna.
I live outside the city.
Give me four hours.
Don't pretend to be alive, you won't be.
I've got Tom's help.
"Anyone didn't know."
What are you doing here?
When I came to the hospital, I told my friend.
I like to buy a ticket to Moscow.
We're on our way.
Don't believe what he's saying.
Tom's getting rid of his accent.
We all knew it was early or early.
There was no disunity.
She's gone.
It's someone.
If I were an Icelandic teacher, I think he would be.
You know what I'm talking about?
I'd like to, you know.
I want to resign from the office.
It's a lot of stuff.
The mats sound.
Tom told me it was.
That's the place Tom's going to go.
Tom's a foreigner.
The phone was invented by Bell in 1876.
I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you do a lot.
I love Ural.
Come on, you're on your way.
You're the one who's telling the truth.
Tom's a persuasive.
I have an appointment for you.
Hello?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning to get married for 20 years.
You're the only one, I'll go.
He's got a lot of talent.
He's in the hospital.
How would you like me to take you?
He's got a Japanese man.
Who would have killed him?
I'm running.
He says he's not illegal.
Tom said he was tired.
He's sitting up late in the night.
Tom's gone.
Do you speak Italian?
I've had a hard time.
She's on her way.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we're up to.
I'm proud of him.
I got home.
Tom's going to put a tree in the oven, and he's going to put it in the oven.
I'm hurting.
I love the stuff.
We're pretty good.
Did you say what he said?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom Mary's keys.
I've always been with him.
I can't help but overlook her.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God was the forerunner of the king of power and priesthood in Jesus.
Did you think I was talking to Tom?
We're going home.
It's thin, but it's tough, and it's not slammed.
It's all stupid.
At this point, I don't know what I want.
It's real.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six or five on TV!
I think she's a dancer.
Tom's a payload.
She killed him.
Was he really there?
Tell me, you'll be dead.
That's all I care about.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He's coming.
Tom, you're welcome, you're gonna ask him.
I'm sorry I didn't see you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we bring Tom?
Tom said I wasn't pretty.
Do you cry a lot?
We didn't do that.
I've read this before.
The car's broken, go.
Will you touch me?
Did you find anything interesting?
It's all done.
I often go to a house.
He's going to be out of the club.
You're grounded for what you're doing.
They're on their way.
She's drinking water.
It's one of the ugly things I've ever seen.
The burglar invaded the city in broad daylight.
I'm gone.
Did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come too.
I'm sorry.
I don't like coffee.
My desk's old.
We both did.
The darkness is imperceptible.
I'll do whatever I want.
Are you with me?
I'll pick you up.
Tom will drown in the bathtub.
Tom and I are the same.
I said before.
Tom is Mary’s brother.
You act like a fool.
Tom likes to stay at school.
The book of the Book.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I'm very clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
You're the one.
Times can change, but nature is the same.
Tom's doing something decent.
I brought the liver.
In this year, Tom's going to be in charge.
I'm going to get her.
That's why I'm here.
Does that make you angry?
The worst part is gone.
We won't hurt you.
Don't be so shy!
I said the phrase on the phone about an hour ago.
He puts her in the shoulder.
Don't you speak English?
How dare you!
The knife was very useful to me.
What have you done to me?
It'll take you a minute.
That's what I'd like.
We both took care of it.
I've been a good boy.
They didn't.
You're not one of them.
I'm like a squirrel in a wheel.
He never survived.
Didn't you come with us?
Tom's a swimmer?
Just tell them you're welcome.
We've worked as hard as we can.
He's riding Hokkaido.
"Shut your mouth and read the book."
You knew her better than I did.
I've already done it with Tom.
I gave you the favor you asked for.
There's no need for her.
I'm sorry to do this without you.
You've got blood from your nose.
Mary got you, didn't she?
I mean, Tom's in the hospital.
You're the one who paid for it.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just do it.
What about you and Tom?
What about the supermarket?
You're my fault.
Tom didn't take Mary.
I don't think I do.
Even if you're lying, you're gonna have to lie.
Tom wanted to ask Mary once.
Tom was thinking.
You're young, you're going in there.
In addition to my brother, I can't swim.
He wasn't there.
I'd really like to be with her, but I can't.
That's not what happened.
I didn't do it.
I can't hurt you.
I bought some bread.
Come on, you're going to school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary have been swapped.
How do you get out of here?
Where are you staying?
But it's hard to know what I'm doing, what I'm going to do, what I'm going to do, what I'm going to do.
Mary made it.
It was hard.
I thought you guys were coming.
I did what you asked me to do.
He said I did it.
That's why I didn't have to leave.
Mary recovered.
I didn't know who you were.
Did Tom take this?
Poetry hurts the children and the children.
Did you tell me you weren't talking about it?
Do you have anything, Tom?
Tom didn't do anything about it.
I want you to say a word for me.
She doesn't like it.
I wish I knew Tom's phone.
"Tom's in." "Yes, you've been to him?" "No, he did it himself."
Yours was a lot of fun.
I overslept the day.
I'm in the same way.
I'm just sure you were thinking about something dirty.
The Sahara is the only place in the world.
What's more important to you in Boston?
I'll take one.
They're about to start.
I told them they didn't talk.
We have a lot to buy.
I read the book.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know who you are.
My favorite tree is a weeping owl.
I don't have a book.
I don't see any of them.
What are you doing?
You're hopeless.
It's in the Sunshine Department.
Are you a policewoman?
Tom has both me and Mary.
You can't say what you said.
He's going through a lot of times.
I'll take a razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just an application.
The river watered the garden.
The wind is quiet.
Ants and giraffes are far away.
Tom, that's because I told him that.
I'm not leaving.
Who gave you that?
You've got it.
Tom was carrying two bags.
Tom didn't seem to recognize me.
Someone's not coming.
I'll tell her myself.
Are you leaving?
Don't tell me.
It's a mountain.
I've got a lot of things.
I've had a meeting with a teacher.
I got used to bed early.
Wouldn't I help you?
Tom's in.
All Tom has is a recorder.
Tom's in the hospital.
It's a delicious pear from all over, I ate.
I've got the parking lot.
I'd like you to talk to your husband.
You can't do it.
It's not mine.
What are you doing?
Ottawa is the capital of Italy.
Tom didn't go to school.
You're such a jerk?
You're in the hospital.
Have you ever done it?
The teacher wrote a note on the third letter.
It's hard to get in.
The tribes have settled.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
Did it start?
There's no matter what she's doing.
I don't know who I am.
"Where'd you get my phone?" "Tom gave it."
Are you going to take the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does anyone do that?
Are you locking up?
Tom said three times it's done.
He says I'm in love with her.
He leaves at four o'clock in the morning.
We can do it.
Give it to her.
I want to stay in Mexico.
You didn't do it.
Change the subject.
I love the place.
Tom's gone.
Tom's not tall, but he's not tall.
It's a good morning, isn't it?
It was a romantic experience.
She prepared a meal.
Find it, Tom.
He'll give it to you.
It's not clear.
What would you do?
He was in the crowd.
Don't you think?
I'm glad I got you.
Tom's the man.
Do you think you're doing it?
Tom once joined Mary in the year.
Where'd you take the cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
The box weighs a ton.
He's got it because he's a jackass.
I'm sorry, I didn't tell you.
He says she won't.
It seemed like he was taking me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
I don't think so.
I'll order it.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
I've been there all day, and I've been there.
Take your coat. It's cold.
I've got a phone.
Don't lose it.
Is Tom mad?
You've got it!
Carton's a mess.
Don't be mad at him.
You've taken care of yourself.
The curse was cursed.
Tom's great grandfather is blind.
Tom have you?
She's got her back putting it in her head.
Tom's easy.
Table two.
It was a strange thing.
I've been talking about all these problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer I went to a mountain resort.
Can you tell me if I'm in the middle of it?
Stay away.
Tom and Mary didn't.
Can you do that?
She's shy.
What are you asking Tom to do?
She seemed like a man.
Press the button.
Tom took Mary to the museum.
Tom was intrigued.
Mary wore boots before her home.
It's a lie.
I'll keep an eye on them.
She said she had a cold.
The dear inspector was grossly rude.
Tom wants to follow his steps.
I don't see anything.
I've got it tomorrow.
He's got his points.
It's gone.
Did Tom tell you where he was?
I can take you to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Tom was the first one.
It's all right.
I got you.
I took your phone.
Plant the tree over there.
Do you wear a bicycle?
Tom will fix it.
Tom said goodbye to his wife.
She was busy cooking.
I don't know what you're saying.
Little pots have pens.
Tom was wearing sandals.
There's a bench under the tree.
Give me what I want from you.
Did you find me?
How do you like my experience?
Tom's got an alarm and he's gone to sleep.
Tom and Mary are tired.
I heard you sing.
Tom and I are.
Did you know him well?
Tom often went to school.
I got Tom.
There was a train.
Tom wears a dresser.
You bought a lot of bread.
He says he didn't.
I have two dogs, three cats, six cats.
Tom has a cable?
No matter what you say, I won't change my name.
Tom's talking.
Get him on the line.
Tom could have told me.
It'll bring you some money.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I had to go.
I've done it.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary took care of her home.
You don't have to sleep.
My mother loved me.
Tom's got a snake on his back.
You bought a store in a supermarket?
He hit me in the middle.
How's your dog?
Walk on the sidewalk.
I don't think Tom is Mary's son.
It rains like a bucket.
It's all about it.
I can't wait to find him.
You can't buy happiness.
Tom's in the house.
I don't want to do that.
The poorest part of the EU is the poorest state in the U.S.?
Tell Tom I said hello.
I want to thank you for what you're doing for Tom.
I ran into my friend.
Are you with Tom?
They did.
You're not the one who has the key to the door?
What are you doing with her?
I'm taking Tom.
We're just in the hospital.
I'm Polish.
Don't suck my salt on me!
We're not afraid.
You guys, we're gonna kill you?
Your shoelaces are broken.
What do Tom and Mary do?
Why are you parked here?
I eat and drink.
Tom was a street man.
Tom didn't attack you.
Do you have your aunt?
I'd like Tom to know that he's going to be here.
Tom took the gun out of his holster and put it on the table.
It's a long way from the state of affairs.
Do you want to repeat what you said?

I can do it.
We've got them.

They're very cheerful people.
You and I have nothing to talk about.

Thomas Mary.
Did you know what Tom had in Mexico?

Go ahead!

This tree is young, bearing fruit.
I don't want to talk to her.
Tom says Mary's teasing.
Tom told Mary to go to the hospital.
It's unclear.
I wish we were.
Tom told me to tell you he was okay.
I'll take you home and tie you up.
Is that what Tom needs?
I made a friend.
I'd love anything, but I'm not a liar.
Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom does.
It's a book.
We've got our passports.
He's on the bed.
Tom's got his glasses.
Neighbor didn't see anything.
I've been talking about you.
Tom's good.

To me, to me, to me.
Have you ever been there?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I don't want to.
She's tired.
I fell asleep.

Water, please.
You're the one I've ever done.
You speak English than I do.
It was cold.
I'm busy!
There's a lot of stuff in this place.
Did Mary say where she was going?
I really don't think you'd think so.
All right, Tom, blow it up.
I'm holding back.
I see yours, and I see yours?
What are you doing taking you to your office?
Put your hands on it.
Tom, it's locked and the key is broken.
He did more than I did.
I have a head.
I'll back you up once or twice.
They're pants.
I bought a magazine in the store.
I've got you.
Tom says he's gone all the way to Mexico.

It's good to be home.
Tom said he got it.
Tom's coming to you later.
Who likes books?

Give us a minute.
She used to cry.
It's the power of foolishness.
Even if I knew, I couldn't tell you.
Tom got here.
I'm going to walk under the roof.
Are you with them?
Tom didn't know who Mary was with in Boston.
That's what I'm talking about.

The train's been delayed for a while.
Are you young?
It's not the case.
Give it to whoever's in it.
Tom didn't take any of the bills.
I'm the only one I've ever had.

Choose it yourself.
I've asked you before.
I'm very upset.
I love it, I love it.
Someone took my umbrella.
I saw Tom in Boston.

I'm just trying to make it.
It's something.
She's got a beautiful coat.
You get up early in the morning?
I want Tom.
He's one of my friends.
He's still in my house, you.
Is that so important?
Let's go to dinner.
I'm yours, and you're mine.
If Tom hadn't taken me, I wouldn't have.
She recovered from the shock of death.
Tom's not doing so well.
Do you know who they are?
I had to tell the truth.
I don't like people who don't grow old.
It'll be too bad now.
I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I
Express yourself as clearly as you can.
She's over there.
Tom didn't take Mary.
You took her in a bicycle theft.
She was at the call center.
I thought you were on your way.
Have you ever done it?
That's a good idea.
We're able to get a delivery to the hospital.
Thomas didn't want to die.
I'm afraid something's wrong with Tom.

We need to talk to them.
People are going to talk.
I don't think Tom would be happy if it were.
That's a good idea.
She's not staying in town.
Do you have any spots?
I don't have anything to do with it.
Just sign up.
I didn't want you to miss your bus.
Go talk to Tom.
Are you going to Boston?
We could be followed.
There's no reason to.

That would be all right.

Get out of here!
I'm wondering if that's true.
That's how you did it.
She showed me a letter on the phone.

Who's your credit card?
He's got it.

I'll talk to you about it.
I wouldn't take them.
I think we've got those.
Tom, you're home.
Wasn't it evening?
I can't forgive him.
Just a little bit.
Mary's nice.
Tom, you're going to be afraid of Mary's dog.
What will you be in?
Tom wouldn't come with us.
They're in the same way.
You've got yourself.
I don't want to go, and the other thing is, it's already gone.
Go ahead.
You're a stranger.
You're looking for me, you're here.

It's one little thing for a woman and a handkerchief for a woman.
Did you think I helped him?
Tom said he was going to Boston.
Do you think you're going to be the one to do it?
How much pay is there?
My daughter's on the phone tomorrow.
We don't know how to do it.

Did you have any wine for red meat?
I'll bring you some berries.

Come on, come on, come on.
It's not fair.
I saw Tom pick up his keys.

Do you respect him?
We've got more than that.
It's more fun for us.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
I don't expect you to be in this.
We're a lot of people in a botanical garden.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Do you prefer blondes or brunettes?
I didn't get on the bus.
That's why you don't do it.
Did you think we could help you?
Be realistic.
Tom took care of it.
I'll get someone to help.
You didn't tell us about it?
Is it Chinese or Chinese?
Burn it.
I've done it.
You're pale like a ghost.
I'll be home by six.

Tom drinks apple juice.
Are you on a trip?
That's how we do it.
How could you?
You're actresses.
Tom was mentally ill.
I've seen it.
My hands and legs will freeze.
How do you translate the words, you don't have to be in the hospital, do you?
Could you rewind that?
I'm going home.
She's holding her room.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom if he'd let us go.
We're stuck in traffic.
Tom's mad at me.
I've washed my head all the time.
It's a prime number.
I won't kill you.
Coffee for me.
We're husband and wife.
The Jacksons took us to the meeting last night.
Tom was presumptuous.
There are leaves in there.
Joanie said she could swim.
What upset you?
I'm busy with her.
Captain is a ship and a team.
Tom says he wants a funeral.
Where'd you go with the pencil?
The third one is gone.
Praise be to God!
Are you sure Tom is okay with you?
I cry every time.
Tom was acting like a girl.
Stop it.
There's only six.
What did you do?
I didn't know you were a romantic.
I've seen you beat up Tom.
I'm glad you did that.
The thief's in the house through the office.
I know how to do it.
Mary's part of it.
Mary's boy is named Tom.
I'm afraid I've got something to tell you.
Tom was supposed to be there.
Tom was a good man.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget the race.
You're in the hospital.
I'm in.
"Are you in your way?" "No, it's my lesson!"
What did you give him?
Tom bought something for Mary?
You went to Boston?
I didn't go to school.
Give me that.
We've got them.
How did you get it?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to go to the hospital.
We'll do our best.
Would you buy something?
Tom's taking a ride.
She's getting up early.
Did she help you?
Do you eat rice this afternoon?
We've been in the hospital.
You'll survive.
What did she buy at that store?
Will we be president?
He's got you.
I'm glad Tom did.
I would have bought it.
Have you ever seen a girl?
I know you're the one.
The bus stop is near the office.
That's the liver I've tried for you.
England is in a lot of places.
Tom wouldn't do that.
I'll give you more than that.
The shit doesn't hurt a dog either.
Don't worry.
Tom's got the keys.
I like talking about peanuts, and I'm going to make myself happy.
What would you do if you were such a good person?
We both went to bed.
Tom just doesn't care what he does.
Tom doesn't tell us a lot of jokes.
Onions can be found in many dishes.
It's not like that.
I'll ask Tom for us.
There was moles in the tree.
Do you speak the sixth language?
My brother is taking me.
I've taken the pencil.
Tom stayed with me.
Is it difficult to teach a language?
Tom's gonna go with you?
What's the remote?
I can't find it either.
You'll speak Swedish.
Who are you?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't hang up.
Tell Tom he didn't get caught.
We looked out, but we didn't.
Did you go with them?
That was a good one.
I don't have the strength, I'm going from morning to morning.
Are we in?
It's a fake.
Tom's a big guy.
Are you making me crazy?
What's going to happen to Tom?
Kevin, you're not going to catch a cold.
He pointed at the bird.
Tom's going to be released.
Fuck you!
I have to move on.
She's nailed her nose to the glass.
There are no words of ser and estar.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
He's pretty good.
You've got a lot of money.
Do you have a name for me?
Tom didn't want to.
Do you have a problem?
SMS, car driver, all right.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to the house.
Do you have a pen?
The pot was a villa.
Wouldn't you have killed yourself?
Tom spoke to me.
Did you ask Thomas?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want to, Tom thought he was making me crazy.
I was very relaxed.
That's what it is.
We'll have ten guests tonight.
Your voice will ring in my ears.
Tom wanted to give you something.
It's a cure.
Are you taking his side?
We weren't cold.
I'm on a cat.
All men.
Are you hot?
His son is a man.
Don't miss it.
Why don't we go to the restaurant tonight?
They didn't fly.
What are you doing with me?
What's Tom talking about?
I told Tom you were going to Australia.
Did you ask for this?
You didn't tell me you had a brother?
Did I get you?
I've been looking for you.
What did you do?
Can you do that to me?
We're trapped in a snowstorm.
The book's on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What happened to us?
You should ask him.
He was opposed.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you he bought his pipe?
She never sent him a letter.
I hired someone to work.
Stop fucking with me!
Tom would've liked it, we'd have done it.
I'm going.
It's your car in the world.
Tom didn't do anything.
I'm going back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do it that way.
Tom Mary's got everything he has with him.
What are you buying?
I've already done that.
Is the weather there?
I took her.
You gave me three hundred.
I wanted him.
I loved him so much.
You're not in front of me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I'm going to love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told Tom that Mary needed it.
You're both idiots.
Are you out of town?
Did you have to do that?
We've got everything we can do.
I wasn't busy at school.
I'm taking Tom.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was screaming.
What's up?
We're grateful for you.
Go to your room!
It wasn't me who told Tom he was leaving.
What are you doing at the school?
The trip took three months.
I know you're something.
They're from the beasts.
He's got cats.
You look like a man.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Someone's coming.
I ran.
You're not ready?
I can't like your car.
You weren't.
You got Tom.
You took it from him.
I congratulate him on his husband.
Mary says she's worth more than that.
Thomas got off the door.
My dad's a teacher.
Tom and Mary had their grandson's grandson's bicycle.
Hold on to the railing.
Is that you?
I'd like you to translate it.
How many glasses?
The lawyer says she's innocent.
I'm sorry.
I don't love Tom anymore.
Who's Tom with?
Taro's got a lot of power.
We both did.
We've done it.
Tom just got out of here.
Did you take Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I'm taking what you're doing.
That's what your uncle said.
I took her.
We know how Tom is.
I've got a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom's doing this.
I don't want to kill you.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
You can put a circle in a row in a row and you can take care of it.
I can't stand myself.
I went to Paris to see them, and they were staring at me, and I couldn't get them to take their own speech.
Did I get it?
I was so stupid that I was into it.
She did it.
It's very expensive.
I'll get it.
It's been ten hours, my mother is mad.
White berries, girl.
The owls are lovely.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom's out of touch.
We're perfect for each other.
French, isn't it?
He didn't take it.
It's gone.
We've got more wood.
Tom said Mary's here.
Let me know, I'll give you some help.
We got him.
He misses her.
He says he's not pregnant.
Is Paris far?
Are you in?
He said he sent you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
She didn't know who she was.
Jim Michael's not coming.
You'll get it, you'll get it.
I'm taking you and Tom.
What did you take off your booth?
We went to the beach.
How do you know you're gonna be at a school this year?
How's Tom doing?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of the units.
I'll be on you when you pay me as well.
I'd like some coffee.
He didn't get it.
I haven't seen anyone in her.
You're the one Tom took.
I know what Tom would have been.
You won't have that chance.
Tom paid to pay.
It's all about me.
She claps.
Tom said he sent you.
We're not like Tom.
Tom's dragging Mary around.
Tom didn't seem like me.
When I grow up, I want a fireman.
Tom regularly eats sushi with her.
We've got it!
Tom said he was here.
No, I'm not tired.
She's lazy as I know.
Mary's already cleaned her room?
For once, I'll forgive him.
I like Chinese food.
It's easier than you do.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a soberer.
Alvaro is a Venezuelan.
Here we go.
He insulted me publicly.
Tom won't win anymore.
Wouldn't I be able to stay with you?
In the Industry, the plates for the Chinese pot and pan are made.
I cried.
Tom wants to go to the trombone.
Come on out.
Do you think I'm right?
I'll take 1,000 pesetas from you for a mole on those jeans.
Are you good with them?
What did you ask Tom to do?
You're young, you're young.
He's gone.
Tom's still in the hospital.
I didn't know exactly what I was talking about.
That's it!
It's hard to break your temper.
I've got two people to go to the concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom tasted like shit.
He dictated the letters of the secretary's secretary.
Did you talk to me?
Are you wearing your pajamas?
Did you do that?
I've never seen him like that.
He likes gardening.
A cup of rice weighs 100 grams.
I should have sent Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You took Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom and Eve.
It's been so hard for him.
Tom knew that Mary was a girl.
Tom and Mary, that's what we're talking about.
Anyone care about that?
It's not on the table.
In a way, Tom.
She took the sonate.
You can go to Tatoeba, you can go to Tatoeba.
The infection got into the blood.
Tom didn't want Mary's girlfriend.
Did he take me?
I've got this place.
You're the one who told me.
Tom's gone.
I'm ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I've been thinking about everything.
Run, you bastards!
I've seen a terrible dream.
I'm sorry.
You got me!
By the way, we've got more than that.
I know what you told her.
I fell asleep at four o'clock in the night.
Mary was not thirsty.
So it wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like that.
I wanted to wake Tom.
I'm sure he's a good guy.
With that thing, man.
As you know, we're late because of a lot of pressure.
She seems to be healthy.
Tom was wearing straw.
Take care of the brothers.
Tom said he didn't.
It's time to go.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like hot pepper.
You're getting up in Mexico?
I put milk in the coffee.
How can I do that?
You're in 1992.
I didn't betray you.
We've done it.
My house's not far from here.
You didn't do it.
The invincible won't win.
Tom's running.
I'm not what you're saying.
I know that Tom's got a little bit of rice.
They're dirty.
I didn't know it was going to happen.
Are you having fun?
He was killed.
Was it a accident?
You took her.
You don't want Tom.
Did you see it?
Tom?
He was, he was.
Put it down.
Tom and Mary are the same.
I was.
I encourage you not to walk.
We're not doing that.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom didn't understand that he didn't want to be a beast.
It was real.
Tom went to Mary's in the hospital.
Why Be Faithful?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find?
We'll make the weather, so tomorrow we'll go to the top of the road.
She and I both did.
How's your wife?
I'm doing my job.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians, which is the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see it?
The more I went over it, the more it seemed to me.
His fascination and fascination, and his pale skins were made alive and blossomed.
What kind of animal do you love more than anything else?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Come on.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were blue from the cold.
Are you famous?
That's a good idea.
It's hard for me to deal with the problem.
Typhoon's got a lot of houses.
He was sentenced to death.
Tell me how you deal with him.
Do you know who speaks English?
I think Tom's still in Boston.
I've got your luggage.
Besides, I'm not.
I love you so much, I can't wait to get you.
Are you wearing my shoes?
The power is in Tom's hands.
I'm going to act and act like my own.
What are you doing on me?
You can't hurt me.
I'm not busy.
Children are more fortunate than children are.
He was taken for his brother.
The fact that we're not here is that we're not here.
I love what I look like.
Guess what I'm talking about.
Tom, Mary's in Mexico.
My husband is a doctor.
Why do you want to go?
I don't like people. I don't like people.
Is that red or yellow?
We're not afraid of fighting.
Because of Tom's work.
Tom is in Australia.
Come on!
It's before it gets dark.
I didn't take you away.
Tom didn't get used to it.
I'll bring your wife in.
What, are you in fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to waste his money on it.
You've taken care of it.
The day before yesterday, we had our granddaughter.
Tom's wearing a suit.
That's the truth!
Get behind the chick.
What are these people?
I've done my best.
Tom couldn't exactly say what Mary said.
It's my job.
You didn't ask me?
Tom's gone 15 minutes.
Tom, that Mary didn't get what John gave her.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll help you out.
We're proud of ours.
That's why I had to take Mary.
Tom had to go to the meeting.
Are you ambitious?
Tom bought all the stuff I bought.
She's his sister, not his sister.
I'm not sure I've got you.
I'll take care of it and I'll take care of it.
I'm sweating for a day.
She's become a million.
Don't leave me alone.
I know everything.
Get us a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What did you say?
I didn't attack them.
Are you all right?
Do we believe that he is the one you claim to be?
King Harald Hormsson, like Harald Sinaiticus, into the state.
We can't do anything for you.
You were a good guy.
Don't you like him?
I'm in Mexico.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
It's been a long time.
You've been up early.
It didn't happen.
It's been hot for days.
He's wearing a coat.
I've been watering.
I ask Tom to tell me what he wants.
Tom didn't see Mary.
You're in your room.
Do you have a problem?
Who's got you?
Can we get him?
Tom's a gift and a gift.
I'd like to talk to her once.
Mary said she'd given it to her.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom loves Hermann Gesse.
In fact, I didn't speak Portuguese.
We've got to get to the bar, we've got to get to the bar, we've got to get to the bar.
What's Tom doing at the U.K. ambassador?
Tom and I have become active.
The boys march four in a row.
Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was coming.
It's fruit. It's so hot.
Tom Mary.
Tom found something wrong.
We have no idea that Tom is doing this.
That's one day.
You're right.
I've got an X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was too heavy.
He's hurt, he's falling.
We are.
I have mosquito bites.
Tom, come on, we'll kill you!
I'm sure Tom didn't do that.
I don't want to know who you are.
Are you pursuing this?
Tom's on the trombone.
Are you out of here?
I want to, she wasn't in the house.
You're not doing that.
I'm sorry to bother you.
McDonald's is a big hamburger.
Tom Mary's girlfriend.
Do you have one?
Do you like the spirits?
The castle's gone.
The diamond is the first thing.
Have a cookie, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-named dictionaries.
Stand down, Sergeant.
You don't think so.
Tom will take us to Boston.
He's on a pretty beautiful actress, by the way.
How did you sleep?
I've got minutes.
Tom wanted Mary.
They've been doing a lot of work.
Tom's a man.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll kill us.
Are there so many people who are underestimated?
Was it easy?
What I was with was a loud fight, it was a loud noise, it was a sharp, it was a drum of her flanks, and it was loud, it was the sky.
I took him in the crowd.
We talked about Jim, he's in the hospital.
We can't just do it and we can't do it.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom's done his job.
That's why you go in.
Tom helped Mary get in the car.
You're the only one I've ever seen.
I know that what I do is wrong.
There's a lot of books going on.
Tom hurriedly gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why are you doing this?
My washing machine stopped.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We need to hire him.
I've been making a fuss about the problem.
You were at home.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
It was so bad that I couldn't take it.
Is Tom awake?
Both audience and audience.
We rented a canoe.
Are you a banana pie pie?
Your sister is my sister.
Well, Tom's not crazy, is he?
Is he your teacher?
Rich people are tall.
I know what Tom's doing.
I don't know, Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we do that?
I didn't know anything.
The ape climbed a tree.
That's what I'm teaching, that's what I'm doing.
Your mother's been walking.
That's all Tom said?
If I hadn't been on it.
You're the one who thinks we're a lot of him.
You know I'm married.
You really live alone?
I told you I'd do it.
Tom, I've got him.
Good luck in this world!
We'd like to send you some money.
I believe in his innocence.
The president rules for six years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
He's a runner!
Do you have one with you?
Couldn't you?
Both Tom and Mary.
Why would Tom do that?
There's a place to go.
You're not doing it, I'm not doing it either.
You're not in the hospital, Tom?
I don't have Tom.
Can you take a while?
Are you giving Tom something at school?
She won't fire him.
I know you're with Tom.
They didn't think I was Canadian.
I'm going to be busy.
Tom Mary.
Hey, you're a singer.
If he had, he would have been a rich man.
I took it myself.
Do you want to say it again?
I'm asking Tom for us.
It's the wind.
Tom didn't have a parachute.
Are you doing this?
He's as good as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
Are you at home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you okay?
He's like a donkey.
I think we can trust you.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had an idea that Mary was on the run for a new job.
I'm going home, he's coming home.
Tom had a dream.
Tom's ready to roll.
You don't mean it.
Don't say it again!
I got him, but I picked up something.
Did you take them?
Mary told me what was going on.
We've got a plan.
I'll tell Tom what you call.
Tom is very strict.
How's it going?
He's getting ready for the skin.
That was very interesting.
I thought Tom was into it.
I'm taking mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're sorry.
Tom's got a moustache.
Did you understand what she said?
You're a little bit of a jerk.
Don't be mad at her.
I've been there.
That's why I'm in the head.
She's taking care of me.
I'm looking for Boston.
Tom said it wasn't going to be me.
Do you know about Boston?
Is that a superstition?
I didn't know who Tom was.
He's in the office.
Who were you talking to?
I want to know that everything's fine.
She keeps her room clean and orderly.
I'm saying Tom needs to go to Boston.
Don't walk in other people's land.
Tom's scared.
Tom's body's red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
What about you and Tom?
You're not Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We've already done it.
How's your class?
Be afraid of yourself.
Tom was very happy.
The famine for him was abstract; he had a lot of food.
The hall needs a curtain.
Did you stay with them?
Tom's early.
I didn't know it was the first time.
He's left-handed.
Someone's coming.
Kzeli, he was on the run.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you're doing that?
Are you afraid?
Are you in?
Her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't take.
I want something for us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What's the root of that?
Tom's gone and Mary's gone.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you're jealous.
I didn't tell him to be an idiot.
Tom doesn't often say that.
We're not doing it any more.
Did you ever tell Tom to do this?
If you were your friend, I would be.
I believe you.
It's expensive.
I don't know how you do that.
I've seen Tom with Mary.
By the way, as soon as I get there, there's gonna be a chance.
I'm not sure she's in.
He was kind to him.
Tom and I ate.
You really didn't?
Tom's got the cricket in the hospital and in the hospital.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll see how it stops.
Thomas from the door.
We've done it.
She couldn't help but think about Tom.
Tom said Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
He and I were crying.
You haven't done it once?
Just a little bit.
What are you doing dressed like that?
Milk can be oiled with butter, oil, and milk.
You don't have to do that.
I've got a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you a girl?
You drink water, not those who have dug a well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her.
Tom Mary, she's going to buy a couple for the family.
Be nice.
You like jazz, right?
You're drunk.
I smoked a lot.
Did you not know that Tom and Mary are John's?
I wanted you to win.
I find myself an unnamed guest.
Are you popular?
They were just like everyone else.
He winked at me.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you're taking them out.
We're on the right foot.
You've got it, you've got it.
Have you ever thought about asking Tom for a favor?
I'll try.
Tom says I eat like a family.
Could you tell the police?
I'm not hungry.
Tom's on the move.
No snowflakes in the snowy avalanche seem to feel like it.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want to, Tom was the one.
Do you have a German dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak English like him?
I'll solve the problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to leave.
Did you have a store?
I'll do it.
He's a big mouth.
It's a splash.
I love the book.
You've done it.
Ice melts, it goes into the water.
Jane Mary, if she'd like to stay overnight.
Tom didn't tell his name.
I went to school there.
The fish's too bad.
Try to be positive.
I had a lot of pain.
She suffocated his pod.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
There was a red girl on the girl's face.
I don't think I can do it.
Tom was deceived.
I've taken you here, I've sent you.
Who's Tom?
I like my coat.
I've done it.
It's a cat.
Tell me this isn't true.
You're not going to get married?
I've got him fixed.
That's a good idea.
Tom loves you.
Tom got a job without a job.
Is that book in your house?
Jenny, could you speak up?
I'll tell Tom he's coming with Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please come to me, not like Jacob Matveyevich.
She's not alone anymore.
Tom doesn't admit that he's wrong because he says it's when he's weak.
I've been to America before.
It cost me more than I did.
Mary stayed with her.
I thought I could do it to her.
Do you have Stevie Wonder's album?
They took me from the house, and I don't pay the rent.
Tell me where you're going.
He's got his hands on it and he's got his hands on it.
This is Park Street.
It's better than Roberto.
The moon is the family.
I don't know, go to bed!
There's no one in the house.
No, she wasn't in love.
You did it on purpose!
You didn't get it.
Tom goes to school.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're going.
I look like a girl, you want to go?
I did it, but I didn't lock it.
So I'd like to keep Mary out of the public.
Are we going to eat?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
They're pretty good.
Don't be so hard on me.
I'm commanding the parade now!
People who have given us years.
I didn't like you.
I know Tom won't give up.
She didn't mean it to me.
He's gone.
You're so smart.
Tom and I are planning to get married for 20 years.
She thought I'd let her down.
I live in Boston.
Tom's taking his secret to the grave.
Are you really taking me to that bank?
I don't think anyone wants it.
We're a teacher.
I love you.
What do you think you're doing about her?
I'm not doing it anymore.
An alien?
Emily wants to be a kid.
Books of those.
Don't worry about it, it's okay.
He's been teaching for eight years.
I thought it was you.
I think you are.
I can't believe I'm really doing this.
Candle to hell.
Why don't you bring me something?
We're wearing blankets for homeless people.
Tom paid Mary a decent salary.
What are you talking about?
Let's eat breakfast.
Tom didn't do it, I didn't do it.
Get in the house!
Tom asked you to come?
The chair will fix.
I thought you were.
Are you all right with us?
You got Tom's keys?
Did I get my name right?
She didn't see her leave her room.
Wa-Bank.
Tom didn't take it.
All right.
He's walking around in the garden.
I don't have a crystal ball.
Your name is false.
She's good.
Did you get that?
Did you think I was putting a box?
The boys are the boys, and the girls are the boys.
You've got to go to bed.
His addiction to alcohol is not new.
It's not risky.
That's why you don't have to do it.
Do you have any idea who could have done it?
The teacher is teaching us that we're going to be in charge, that we're going to be in charge.
I'm married.
He bought a camera.
Shut up and eat.
I've done it for you.
I dedicate it to you.
She's more important to me.
You're a little kid, you know what a logarithm is.
I've been doing it all day.
I was shocked.
Around the world, there are people who are vulnerable to hunger and hunger.
I'm glad your job was in the SM.
I'm convinced I'm right.
I didn't know you'd learn it.
Let's go home.
You've got it.
I'm not coming.
Tom doesn't spend a lot of time talking about it.
So we have to go with Mary.
I wonder what Tom's up to.
You didn't.
I don't think I can do that.
Tom's got a problem.
Who are you talking about?
Tom's hand was bitten by a muren.
That's why I didn't.
He'll be leaving home soon.
I don't think he's coming.
I want to go to England.
Have you seen anyone in the park?
I didn't bring you in. You didn't go in there?
Tom got here three years ago.
She left Boston.
We've done everything.
Tom could have killed me.
Grandpa Ali was a drummer.
Who didn't tell us?
He's wearing his pajamas.
I'm taking Tom to the lobby.
You were old, you went to Boston?
He's doing his best.
Tom saw the UFO.
I know who you were with.
Does Tom have a bicycle?
What are you doing with them?
And the repairs are good.
I'm having breakfast this morning.
It's not a bug, it's a fig.
You got a car?
The tourist map of the city was very impressive.
I'm sorry, but I can't.
Tom took care of everything.
Come as far as you can.
We're not hungry.
Learn it, not for the sake of taking the boss, but for the sake of what she says.
You can't translate it yourself, you can't translate it yourself.
Is Mary home?
Just don't bet on Tom.
I don't think I'm biased.
I'm sorry, I didn't do it.
I'm doing it.
I knew Tom was buffing.
I'm doing my best.
It's a sign.
I'm sure they're their guardian angel.
Tom destroyed his bank force.
She's in the hospital.
What's going to happen to me?
He was so interested that he took care of himself.
I told him I didn't.
Tom wants help.
I thought you didn't.
We're both the same.
It's strong, it's strong.
I took him naked.
There's a lot of books in her.
I didn't let her go home.
Did you talk to her?
Did you get it?
I didn't want you to.
We all got together.
Tom was three days before he got here in 2013
The young man was silent.
Tom's in love with his favorite, and he couldn't help but sing.
Is that what you're doing?
Tom Mary apologized.
The stain is actually on the table.
Tom with someone?
Tom didn't tell me anything.
I'm driving.
They're fake.
You're back, I'm already gone.
Did you talk to him?
I thought you stopped with him.
Tom took Mary.
She's in love with you.
My wife will often send me, and she will take care of me.
You're in bed.
I'd like to denote my own.
Tom's on the banjo.
Tom didn't say he did.
He doesn't like coffee.
Jenny, turn it on.
Don't make Tom cry.
The police didn't take Tom.
How did you get into my room?
What did you tell Tom?
We went to Australia.
I have a lot of wages.
Tom's got his honey.
Tom's gone to Mary's.
You took them.
Tell her she'll be gone.
I don't know anything about it.
We've already done three.
I'm glad you were there.
They gave me a job.
It's a mountain for a year.
Tom went to Mary's shop to buy sugar.
I love it.
Stay away.
What's the worst place you've ever been in?
I thought you hated us.
Think about it.
Tom says Mary's more than that.
I took it for a joke and I didn't do it.
His name wasn't Tom Jackson.
Is that sarcasm?
It's not something you'll regret.
Are you jealous of her?
I'll be able to take care of it.
It's going to be paid away from the government and the government.
I think Tom's right.
You don't like sports.
Tom told me you were married.
I knew I wasn't coming.
We're waiting for you and your family.
Did you take her?
I told you I changed my mind.
That's what you said?
You've done it, you've done it.
The Esperanto doesn't go.
You need help, tell me.
Did I get home?
You wouldn't do anything.
Tom didn't think Mary would be upset.
There's a shopping area nearby.
Mary thinks she's smart.
Put your fist down.
Tom didn't know exactly where Mary was.
I'm here to see you.
It's a good idea.
Tom's a tough guy.
We don't even know her.
Tom invented them and put them on Mary, like he did on Daddy's.
I know you're hiding your bills.
It's school.
It's a pencil.
Did your mother care about that?
Do you like that?
Tom's in the hospital.
I told them not to.
That's how Tom died.
Coffee's empty.
Write with a pencil, please.
We can't do it.
He confessed to him.
It's the most beautiful painting I've ever seen.
What did you do?
He's got something to do with it.
At times, Claudius thought about psychoanalysis.
Tom wouldn't do that.
You need to find a job.
He's the same guy.
She's proud of herself.
I've taken care of it.
Don't leave your car on the road.
I already knew that.
I've done it.
I knew you would take them.
Hey, I know you.
"Help!
Do I use the curtain?
You're not right to that.
I'm yours.
He vomited out. He threw up.
You're going to die, man!
Are you all alone?
I want to, because we've become friends.
Who do you think you're doing?
Do you like it?
It's a rough road.
Tom made breakfast.
Come in.
I saved them for grandchildren's grandchildren.
I'm glad Carol and Will Will are here.
How do you like Tom?
Tom says you didn't.
Tom, come on, man.
Help me find her.
Tom didn't bring it to me.
I've got to get under the fence.
The fireman couldn't hold back.
It's been a long time.
It's a girl.
That's what you're doing.
America has slavery.
Don't you recognize him?
Kzeli, he didn't die in prison.
He often sits down at times reading books.
I didn't know you said that.
Tom unloaded the car.
Tom knew something about Mary that John didn't know.
There's no one.
We need to take him.
Are you busy?
I've been wrestling.
Tom, you're on the phone.
You're the one who didn't.
You ready for tomorrow?
We've got it.
Come on, Tom's in the garage.
I don't think that's true.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me I was coming.
Are you coming to your place tomorrow?
A box of foods.
Did you talk about it with Tom?
Is that a bat?
She's taking you to prison.
Tell me what I know.
You can't force me on you.
That's pretty good.
The leaves are chewed.
I did, and she didn't.
We've got a lot of kids.
He's got me, he's got my point.
Mount Kilimanjaro is a sleeping volcano.
Why don't you go with her?
You just didn't tell them?
I can't do it.
Tom got me, I didn't get the law.
I have to go back to Boston.
Have a seat, girl.
Wake Tom up.
Here's a map.
You should have stayed with us.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
Tom said he's not hungry.
I have to tell you.
I'd prefer you didn't talk about Tom.
I didn't want to do anything.
I'm not sorry.
They kept their place in the hideout.
She rushed to the station afterward, taking the train.
Don't say that to your bride.
Tom's tired of taking Mary to the hospital.
I recommend it to you.
It's not your fault.
The police killed Tom's car.
I did not know what it was.
Are you okay?
I'm going to prison.
Can't you make me the way I am?
Honey.
Tom never knew Mary was here.
I don't know who's gonna be at the hospital.
It's hard to get to the president.
You're hungry, you're hungry.
I've always been.
He's no longer a member of the club.
I'll take care of it.
I don't trust her.
Six three times.
Scala is an anagram called lasca.
I haven't seen anything Tom's done to anyone.
Dan's in a meeting against me.
You've done it.
I'm gonna give you two ways to go.
He's on her side.
I'm not in charge.
I think you did it.
She spoke so gracefully that she had us all.
That's where she's secretary.
They're not that bad.
I thought I had the whole thing.
It's gonna be okay.
I've met Tom.
I'm good.
He says his son's going to be up to a hundred.
Something's wrong.
Tom hates it.
There's a garden in front of the house.
Didn't you go?
I did, you paid someone, he did it.
It's for a friend of yours.
Tom said Mary was innocent.
Tulip is the symbol of the prefecture.
I knew we'd be here.
I didn't want to take it.
She's in the hospital.
I'll give you a little karate.
Don't talk about a dog.
Tom's being cremated tomorrow.
That's not true.
You're done.
On the flight trips to Karuidsava, tourists sank.
I've seen Tom's garden roll in.
He didn't do it.
She's wearing her glasses.
I love the ads.
It was just water.
I bought it for my wife.
I won't forget how she and I went to Hawaii.
You didn't.
How did this get here?
Tom and Mary said they didn't.
I'd love to come with you, but I can't.
Shock 11.9 percent, the whole world has been condemned for their worthy defamatory.
Call me Taro.
I know them.
You didn't talk to him?
Tom Ben.
You said it was real.
Tom's a good man.
I didn't want to, she and I had the same thing.
I don't know all the students.
You're the one who killed me!
Facial casualties.
Tom told me to go to the people with the kids.
He's what you asked him for.
Excuse me, are you there?
Peace be to you.
I'm sick of it.
Tom's a bad guy.
I can't go to hell.
We're marrying in Mexico.
Tom and Mary don't talk to you.
We'll see you soon.
Let's go.
He didn't get his keys.
I'm nervous about manners.
Eat your food.
And then what happened?
He likes me, doesn't he?
Tom Mary, that's what I'm talking about.
He doesn't talk about it.
I gave them till noon.
I wanted to go back to my room.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I've already told you that you should know.
You're free, you're not free until you're free.
Does it matter?
I know Tom's secret.
Tom is yours.
It's a hell of a thing.
You couldn't get into it.
Tell her I'm fixing the refrigerator.
It's a girl.
The rabbit's got that blood out of his ear.
Postmodernism has been replaced by modernism.
I've already read the book.
Damn it!
He's got it.
You've got it, you've got it.
Did you talk about being in the hospital?
Are you sure Tom is real?
I'm not afraid of you.
I don't have as many jobs as you do.
I'm selling food at the hospital.
I could have been younger.
I didn't.
John, who's in the hospital, wears the nickname "Mr. Altitude."
Tom's at the hospital tomorrow morning.
I didn't kill them.
Do you recognize him?
I didn't really care.
Tom's got one.
I don't have to come here.
Don't make that sour face!
Is it crazy?
Tom's gone.
There were rumors about them.
It's real.
The sky is full of clouds.
It's a bird that's dying.
You made her happy.
How's it going?
Tom didn't look like he was having fun.
I'm fed up.
You said it was important.
He said it was straight.
They're very helpful.
Everyone in the village was named Zeal cap.
I don't want to.
It's time to go to bed.
You've got to get out of here.
I made it.
Tom won't.
No, it's not.
I'm afraid you don't have a job.
Did you take care of it?
That's what people have led to the corruption of government officials.
Did he wrap up his pants?
I can't keep him from his brother.
We can hit him.
I'll go with her.
Did the phone call you?
I really need to beat someone up.
I don't think Tom has anything.
Come here.
I went to Canada in the winter to ride.
That's good.
Tom says I'm sorry Mary didn't.
I was in the 266th of 1968.
I want you to stay away from Tom.
That's what I'm talking about.
The entrance to the hospital is disabled.
Tom's full.
He speaks English, he speaks English, he speaks English.
Move it in, man.
"Tom's wife."
I've been thinking about you all day.
It's a lot of stuff.
I can't pay you.
That's what I said in the hospital.
I think I'm going to go after him.
The train's gonna take a minute.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with her.
How would you do that?
I'm familiar with you.
I heard you shouting.
He's that boy, the painting.
Call up on the phone.
Who would do that?
Medicines are in charge.
Do you have any?
They went into the woods.
I've been talking a lot.
You're on the road for now.
It's bright.
The coral reefs are infested.
Tom said it was Mary's fault.
You didn't want to talk about it.
We're on our way.
I didn't realize that Tom and Mary would do it.
The temperature dropped at zero.
"You don't wear it." "You don't?" "You don't?"
Tom's done business.
I knew Tom wasn't in Mexico.
I'm the ocean, and I'm dreaming.
In the city, like the city, I'm walking, not driving.
As it is, it's about to happen.
Now Tom's in the hospital.
I didn't see her.
A lot of voices in the factory.
You got us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom told you.
He'll be here soon.
He didn't think it was a disperiential policy.
I know that.
Come on, Tom.
Can you tell Tom of his brother-in-law?
I don't get paid for it.
Tom ripped the board off with a claw.
Stay down.
How did you get there, Tom?
She's saying it's in Lebanon.
Tom's eating.
The popularity of the phone has led to fewer people writing letters in our days.
I think we do.
Zhenya went to our town three years ago.
You won't be ours, will you?
My puppy's dead, and I'm dead.
She's pretty good.
I've got a rose.
It's so quiet.
She's a beautiful woman.
You've got it.
Tom, I'm sorry.
It's just not going to happen.
They can't take care of themselves.
Did you get it?
She says she's tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a bad time.
I mean, I'm from Boston.
Did Tom get away?
Tom didn't think so.
That's why they didn't tell me.
Two days ago, I took a cold.
I got him.
You're not welcome.
Let's go to that coffee shop or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom. He'll tell you the same thing.
He's the one who's back and he's waving his hands.
I'm with you.
Did you see him like that?
I was thinking about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
You went to the theater tonight?
You've taken care of yourself.
There's no air conditioner in this house.
Tom and Mary are studying.
My boss is a good boy.
They're blocking him.
I'm very brave.
Tom, Mary's in Boston at the hospital.
Don't let me do that.
It's your turn, Bashar!
You're talentless.
It's a stupid thing I've ever done.
I'm in Boston.
Excuse me, could you repeat the statement?
How do you know you're dealing with Tom?
Check with Tom, Mary.
That's not true.
Tom's gonna be at the hospital.
Tell her I'll call.
We couldn't have been here.
I knew I'd kill you with Tom.
Under the President's leadership, strict control was once and for all, banned by the private lobby.
I've got it, we've got it.
You're taking Tom.
Not Tom's brother-in-law.
I'll take it to the hospital.
Give it to me, girl.
We need to talk to her.
You've got it.
We're careful.
You need to go to bed.
I'm proud that my father is a good cook.
Did you tell me anything?
Thomas Masha.
I told her it was.
He did it.
Tom didn't have it.
You didn't mean me.
That's why it was there.
I'll take the bus to Boston.
Tom wants some shampoo.
Tom's in his room.
You're going to pay.
Did you make coffee?
You could have told the truth.
She's all about herself and herself.
You usually say the same thing.
We both speak the same language.
Find yourself a suit.
Who told you to find me?
Who's Tom taking?
It's not what I wanted.
How are you holding your shoulder?
Tom had the fact that he was in prison.
We're going for Spartak!
That's how he performed the celebration.
Why was he doing this to Tom?
It's in the house.
The truth is bitter.
You didn't do it.
Did I say something funny?
What's the matter with you?
Meg never bothered me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's been a long time.
I sent him.
There's a lot to be done here.
You used to be a fighter.
Relay.
I used to live on the Park House.
Try to get in there.
I've already read this.
It's good for you.
Until you're done.
She's not like everybody else.
We'll find a lot of information about him before we talk to him.
What's in this case at the hospital in Boston?
Did you get there?
Peaches aren't sweet.
I don't think there's any black spots.
I told you everything that was done.
No, I'm not.
Let me pay.
I can't forgive his laziness.
Tell me what you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I'm sorry, Tom was arrested from the hospital.
Tom said he was alone.
I didn't tell the people I was going to Australia.
Who's six years older than I am.
You're not in?
Tom just wanted to know that you meant it.
Tom's gone without a girlfriend.
I'm going with you.
They cleaned the shit out of the house.
Tom and Mary, that's all right.
They've given us their best.
Tom had to go to Masha.
Are you hungry?
What will happen to him?
Tom and I are in trouble.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You don't want to win.
Tom's a famous celebrity.
It's all about living quarters.
I've seen them all.
Like everybody else, he's the guy.
The painting hangs on the wall.
Mary said it hurts.
I want my dog.
Is Tom with you?
It's dark.
I've got Tom ready.
It's in the state of the state.
I'm worried about them, too.
He's taking a job, taking a letter.
Eat the powder in the cup of beef.
Will you go with her?
Let's get one of those tickets at the station.
Tom took them.
She says she's here.
Are you following me?
Don't hurt me.
Let's take him to the hospital.
How come you know each other?
Who wrote this letter?
Drop the guns.
What happened to the hospital?
The rent for the apartment is in Manhattan.
You don't get them.
Tom's the guy.
You're going to buy them?
You sounded like my girlfriend.
I don't have a family.
Let's do something.
You're a translation, aren't you?
I know that Tom Mary.
We're good.
That's why I did it.
Don't do anything for us.
Stop it!
You helped me.
Don't knock at the hospital.
You got him.
I told her to tell her something.
We know you don't like the house.
Tom started to say something was wrong.
What's he doing?
You're tired, you're asleep!
I'm afraid I won't have any.
Did you not know that Mary was Tom's wife?
I'm going further.
Tom and Mary stopped.
We're going to fight.
What's your dad's name?
Don't you tell me?
I'm not sure what Tom said.
Tom's a mustache.
I wasn't ready.
I'm going to take that girl.
Tom's alive.
He's got a neck.
What are you doing?
You left the bar right at the moment, and I'm going to put my brother-in-law on my behalf.
Tom told me it was real.
I want to go to the hospital.
I'm 100% up to you.
I haven't seen you for three years.
You'll tell her you're going to.
I've got a sudden headache.
I've been talking about what I've been doing.
We've got a lot of guns.
Don't make a box.
I'm sorry.
I see him at the club.
Tom Mary, she's crying.
It was fun.
Did Tom take you?
It's panicking.
Hey, what's up?
I spent three days in Boston.
I'm sure he's taking something away from us.
Tom knocked him down.
Tom, I'm sorry.
I didn't do it.
You've been doing more than that.
You did it.
How's it going with each other?
I managed to get this from Tom.
Don't feed trolls.
Did Tom sleep?
I won't tell you.
Did you do that?
The equator divides the land by two.
He's a lander.
I haven't seen anyone.
The trees are on their way.
It was taken from the police.
Tom didn't say that.
Tom didn't say Mary did.
I'm with Tom.
I have to tell you.
That's a yes.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
Give me your address.
Can you see me?
He told me.
Are you doing this with Tom?
Tom lit the cigar.
It was snowing all night.
The book was worth five hours.
That's how many of them are.
Money is the root of all anger.
Tom's at his desk.
Tom asked Mary to make coffee.
There's a gun on the sparrows.
They went to the mosque to pray.
He said he had everything; yet he didn't.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Tom's already done it.
Tom couldn't.
I love this place.
Tom doesn't have a car.
I didn't know what I was doing.
They can't do it.
Obviously, you changed your mind.
He's reading the paper this morning.
There's no calories in the water.
I think we've got them on the job.
He didn't.
Did you go to the store?
Help me translate the document.
Tom's a little bit of a mystery.
We'll be on the road.
I know Tom's name.
It's been a big help.
I'll give you a ride.
Tom and Mary have a hard time?
I don't know if he's coming here.
Because Tom's in Boston tomorrow, our chance is to give him that.
Tom and Mary didn't.
It didn't happen to us.
Tom was holding a knife in his pocket, and the police came in.
He's got a number.
I thought Tom was incredible.
What's your husband doing for you?
I mean, she's a good girl the other day.
Tom doesn't have a cat or a dog.
Sohi was in favor of that.
Your shirt was small to me, and I walk in it.
All right, I won't do that anymore.
That's why they loved them, not for them.
Tom was brutally killed.
I didn't want to, I felt sorry for you.
Right!
Tom didn't want to take any more credit.

Is that yours?
It's me.
Who took you?

I don't care if you tell me.
Before we go.
What are you talking about?

That's what you can do!
I have a white dog.
I didn't know you guys were here.
I'm not going to take any action.

Tom didn't tell you.
Tom bought a lot of milk.
You've led us to tears.
Tom said he wouldn't be in the middle of the night.
Are we in the hospital?

No, it's more beautiful than that.
I've got books, Tom's.
How's it going?
You have to go home.
A present for me?
How are you, who are we?
Tom's a little tough.
You're the one.
Are you crazy?
You were old enough to be in Boston?

That helped me.
Did you help them?
That's why I've got my points.
Is there something in her?
I'm going home.
What's your name?

You don't want me?
Let's talk about it.
Stop it, you've made him cry!
Are you so sure about him?
Tom asked Mary.
I didn't say anything because I didn't know what to say.

I'm glad you're happy.
I won't let you be alone.
I'd like you to do that.

I'm good.
The nurse burned his temperature with a degree.
She understood what I was saying, and she got excited.
Tom and Mary are both in the hospital.

I'm sure I'm not coming with us.
I'll stay until he gets away.
Let's hope this year will be over.
That's why I came.
I'm going to keep it down, okay?
I think you love Tom all the time.
Did you say you were leaving?
You're so rude!
I guess we're gonna have a job.
She's in a language.
I'm strong.
I think he's worthy of dignity.
He couldn't say that.
He's gonna hug her.
I'll take my cup, but I won't take it.
Mary's a bad girl.
What's the matter with you?
Tom, you're the one.

Is it from her?
What about Namibia?
Tom couldn't do much more of himself.

She was riding a bicycle.
You can rely on it.
Tom used to use a hammer to save his penny.
They're not fat.
It's a matter of fact.
I need to talk to Tom.

You're the one who's got your points in it.
I went with her.
Tom said he definitely didn't. He's gonna go to the hospital.
We'd like to send you some money.
Tom didn't get cream from the family.
How many times do I tell you that I'm not married?
I'm sorry.
What were you doing?
Your daughter doesn't like lunch?
I don't think so.
Tom's angry?
Can I go behind the alleys?
I'm sorry for showing you the favor.
Say good night, Tom.
The boys were over him.
You're talking the same thing you're talking about?
Tom Collegiate with Batman and Superman.
You're going to talk to them.
Have you cut your hair once?
Boy's good at saying things.
I respect the elders.
It wasn't in that room.
It's a good job.
We're overwhelmed.
Tom told Mary to take her.
I wish we had one!
I'm on my way.
I'm glad she's fine.
Should we tell Tom?
Tom's telling people.
I'm glad you liked me.
I've taken care of it.
The bus goes to school and to the state.
Tom took his glasses off and wiped his forehead.
How do you feel about your wife, Tom?
I'm just going to be alone.
The nurse came to see the hospital.
I don't think it was Tom's fault.
That's, you can say, the language.
I'm taking the lead.
He's unstable.
Do you love each other?
We're being manipulated.
She's my girlfriend, and I'm not her.
I love Mom.
I can't take you.
Stop the car!
Roses are kind of a species, and pigeons are a species of birds.
Tom's got a job.
That's three things.
We were feeding on things that we could find in the living room.
Let's take a moment.
He went to New York for a ride.
Tom wants to be famous.
He's good.
Without books, I'll introduce myself.
Tom's gone.
It would take a couple of hours.
Let's sing about it.
I'm good.
I don't even know.
The kidnappers took him.
I really appreciated you.
Tom is a man.
Tom told me he was staying.
How are you doing?
I'll tell you, Tom won't know.
I know Tom.
This is our land.
Will you stay in Boston?
I've done it.
It makes sense on the press board.
It's about two miles away.
I like to talk.
Is that why you're doing this?
I'm in for him.
I'm on it.
Did you work?
The red umbrella is looking for her grandmother.
Are you gonna tell me I'm wrong?
Who's your friend?
Learn as hard as you can.
Are you Tom's brother?
I'll talk to you, Tom.
He's all right.
I felt the earth shaking under my feet.
Tom doesn't want to sleep.
Looks like he was poor when he was young.
Tom was killed.
He goes to a school for the deaf.
I don't think I'm here.
Are you standing there?
Tom's on a banana leather.
That's what I'm worried about.
He's pretty good at it.
It's a big deal.
I've taken care of it.
You're not in the car.
I just don't know what you're talking about.
Wake me up at 6: 00 p.m.
I'll talk to her about it.
Do you think we're gonna tell her?
I know you're in there.
Do you want to translate the manuscript from the manuscript to the manuscript?
I'll write you tomorrow.
I said I'd be there.
I'd like to stay with you.
More than that.
I'm on it.
That's a good idea.
She got into me.
I'm sure I've got it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Do you know how to fix this?
Are you in the hospital?
We're pretty good.
Tom is a fugitive.
Tom's busy.
It's a beautiful house.
Be brief.
That's why Mary got married.
Tom forced Mary to work.
I won't do it.
Give me that.
I won't be doing it any more.
He said he wasn't offended.
Don't worry about it.
Tom's got an accent.
That's what I told them.
He was a simple man.
Tom took a little money out of the box.
She stopped publishing the paper.
I'll get the passersby.
Tom's hiding behind the curtain.
A drink?
Give it to him, help me.
I used to be like them.
I should've done it.
What have you been up to now?
There is one.
Is that what you're doing?
How do you know who you're looking at?
What are you talking about?
She told me she was doing it.
You didn't tell me about it?
My aunt's in New York.
He's got wine.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
I thought he was crazy, but he wasn't connected.
This is Tom's.
How's it going?
Now you.
Get rid of the gun.
I've already got the wrestles in my liver.
I'm not really good at it.
It's time for you to go to bed.
"Are you?" is a little rabbit.
What are you doing?
Hey, buddy!
Tell me you're not doing it!
I went to see her at the hospital.
I don't know anything about it.
Are you moving to Boston?
Tom is invincible.
Tom was in the hospital with me.
We can talk.
I think we're doing it.
I don't want it.
Buckle up.
I bought a camera like yours.
Have you been drinking wine?
She bought books from the books.
Mary said she didn't do it.
Two wands, two wands, one of them.
She's just a girl.
How can I buy a self-embodied shirt?
Tom and Mary, that's what we're doing.
It's not my fault I take them all.
I'm sorry.
It's time.
Write me, you'll need help.
I didn't ask you for help.
Tell him everything's fine.
What can I find?
She helped us.
What are you doing in ten years?
Who bought you this?
Tom's out of the house.
Let's go.
It's like there's a bunch of gods hanging out there, isn't it?
It's getting warmer.
The baby was crying, thirsting for milk.
Tom is wise, you don't have to do that.
Who's that?
I'll take it back to the hospital.
If you give him anything, you can take it for the wind.
It's been a long time.
The boxer beats me.
What's the secret?
You don't wear a shirt.
What, he wasn't a girl?
I'm begging you.
It's resourceful.
Tom bit a bite.
I just want you to do it.
Are you sure she's all right?
I'm talking to Tom.
Are you kidding or are you kidding?
That's why Mary doesn't say that.
Get out of here.
Tom took it.
Tom sleeps on his belly.
Tom is older than I am.
Tom will be pleased with you.
I've got him for you.
Two of them competed in France.
Why don't you come in?
Tom said Mary's joking.
Tom knew Mary was a problem.
I made a noise.
I need a job.
Do you want to go?
It's red.
What would you do if you did?
Does your mother smoke?
Take Tom away.
We can deal with the problem with the sides.
She didn't have her brother any more.
Tom couldn't stand it and wept.
You're not Catholic?
I wanted you.
Are you sure Tom is okay with you?
You're not talking.
Tom and I often give each other a gift.
I've got two and two.
I know you're doing this.
They've got their umbrellas.
He's in charge.
Tom doesn't like Boston?
The CD is ten.
Yeah, that's good.
See the sky on the horizon?
Tom cleaned up and washed his face.
Foreigners are hard to get used to.
I'm British.
She's her wife.
I knew you had one!
We're not like Tom.
Tom wants to go?
Tom cut the fire.
I can touch the palms of the floor without bending.
We're inviting you to the office of counselor and counselor.
You didn't tell me.
I sucked on my ass.
Tom said he didn't have a lawyer.
Don't you mind if I open the opening?
They got it?
As I get into the classroom, the students get into the classroom.
Tom walks around all day.
Don't go, girl, don't go, don't go.
We're going to Australia for honey.
The girl didn't say anything.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I want you to be the husband.
I've put my name in the office.
I don't have a job.
I'm glad you told me.
You can't blame you for being scared.
They don't want it.
Tell Tom what he's doing.
Mary ate what she wanted.
I'll be in charge.
Did you tell me anything?
I'm going to go to the one you said that.
What happened to her?
Jenny, order him.
Tom's looking for breakfast.
Doctors were talking about both.
That's why I did it.
Are you paid for this?
Are you eating fruit?
Tom, did you pay for this?
It's hot in here.
You're talking in your sleep.
It's Tom Mary driving.
I'm sorry and I'm sorry.
What are you lying to them?
Why don't you take your coat off?
I've got it.
To tell you, I was lonely.
It looks like he's got it.
Tom took care of it.
I've done it.
How can I buy it?
Did you take a taxi to the zoo?
I've seen Tom swim.
We need to find him.
Are you mad at Tom?
I should have stayed with her.
The accident is right on our behalf.
I'm not sending Tom and Mary to Boston with whom.
They sing a fire.
You won't be missed.
I thought Tom was Mary.
We have a test tomorrow.
She didn't take any action.
I've got my rules.
Tom and Mary said they didn't have a hospital.
I'm afraid he's got a lot of money.
You didn't have to go too far.
In the season, our team won all the matches.
He won't be anything to me than a friend.
I think I'm doing it.
Mary's left wrist.
Is that what I said?
Do you really believe that Tom is here?
Are you talking about it?
I didn't.
Tom, it's Mary.
She stabbed herself.
Coco's got more than 500 words on it, deaf people.
Tom's got a girlfriend.
And Tom's father and mother is a teacher.
It's better than ours.
Tom was on duty.
It was in our box.
I want you to behave yourself while I'm gone.
You need to go.
I don't know about you.
We do what we deserve.
How can this be accomplished?
He's taking the bus.
Ukko is a god of heaven, a god of crops, and a thunderstorm in the ficco.
Does it exist?
I thought there was someone in there.
My neck's gone.
John and I are friends.
How do you think Tom got us?
Is that so hard to deal with?
Tom started with a clerk in the hospital.
Do you like it?
Tom is my husband.
What would you do if you had one?
It's been a flood all day.
Wish me a wish!
You killed her.
It was part of the plan.
I've got a name for you.
Tom will be proud of you.
Can't you lend me $20?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean that.
That's not the case.
Northmen fighting the Battle of Bull Ran.
"Where's the book?" "Onlookers."
You are.
She took her book.
Should I bring Tom with me?
You're welcome.
King of the book of blasphemies and destroy them.
That's a real name.
I had a teacher.
Tom, at least once, cleans the string.
They didn't fit in.
Are you swimming this day?
Did you give him your phone number?
Let's get this for Tom.
What's a bullfight?
He's a swimmer.
I'm more than that.
How are we going to get her?
You're not.
I don't have business.
Let's go now, girl.
I've given them to me.
What are you planning on?
You didn't tell me?
He's a little kid.
I've been looking for you.
What do you mean?
Tom took care of it while everything went down.
You and you are good.
He's in the hospital tomorrow.
I saw your sister the other day.
Tom and Mary are here.
How did I get you?
It'll be fine.
Tom misses Mary's wife.
Tom loves you.
This isn't about you.
It's not a solid person.
You should go to the hairdresser's.
It's easy.
Kind of.
I didn't think I'd do that.
We had a good time.
Tom’s mother told him he needed more vegetables.
Tom won't forget that.
The car's jammed.
I'm taking the document.
It rained for three days.
I took Tom.
He's been forced by the time he was one year old.
Tom said he wasn't alone.
Sarah.
Thunderstorms frighten and capture the spirit.
It's not as hot as I am.
All the rules.
He took Mary.
We got on the bus.
It's simple.
I'm sure I'm in his room.
So there's something to say.
Come on, Tom and I haven't done anything.
There's no need.
It's hard.
They have a blue-golden flag.
Can you take this to Tom?
That's right, Tom.
I'm in love.
Tom is introverted.
It started.
Tom and I haven't done it.
We're in Boston.
It wouldn't help me.
"Do you have a hand?" "A little."
What are you doing?
I'm pretty sure it's not.
He's a little peanut.
I thought about it.
I'm waiting for you across the door.
He's pretty busy in the morning.
Sooner or later she's gone.
He was good for me.
Is this where you live?
I don't think I can do it.
I need a helmet.
I don't want to be with her anymore.
It was inevitable.
I did it for you and Tom.
I don't think Tom wants what Mary wants, he bought her.
It's my book that you've been breaking to pieces.
Tom's in town.
Tom says he didn't cry.
Get out of the shower!
Did you sing?
It's a restaurant, I know.
Tom stopped.
It's a real shot in front of Bottas, and he's got a nervous nerve, and he's going to kill you, and he's not going to.
We've got a check-in.
Did you tell Tom that?
We're gonna talk to them.
I'm talking about Tom.
You're home till four o'clock.
You could have said "with" to the best of your ability, someone who helped you.
I knew Tom wasn't strong in his shoes.
Tom's a brand collector.
Don't give me a laser in my face!
Boston's got a lot of people out there.
What's this?
She's busy.
You've never given us a hard time.
I didn't touch you.
My father did.
Who cares about Tom?
The car's stuck in the shelter.
That's why Tom did it.
Tom's pretty good at it.
I have no idea.
I've got some work to do.
Tom's got a lot of football and stuff.
Tom's in Italy at a restaurant.
Tom didn't get away.
I didn't know you'd come too.
Tom was in the middle of the erasing process.
Did you take the job?
That's why they teach kids.
I'm going to get a ride.
Do you want me to do it or not?
I'm not interested in him.
We need one of them.
He won't take her.
Tom and Mary, that's a lot of times.
In an hour, I'm hanging out with Tom.
Did you know what Tom had in Mexico?
I'd like to.
Can I borrow your ball handle?
Tom told me he knew Mary.
The lawyer was fascinated by the company.
I wonder who sent me the roses.
She's a wise mother.
Tom doesn't want to talk to her.
Tell her I'm coming.
He's gone home, I've sent him.
He's walking.
Tom told me he loved me.
You're the one, am I?
Tom doesn't have a girlfriend?
Let's call for help.
You're sitting on a chair.
What's the matter?
Tom says Mary's a lot of company.
I'm glad for Tom.
I put the stripes in the bookmarks.
Tom's the boss.
I'm glad I'll be back soon.
Do you have the panel below?
Don't argue with me.
Dima slept with 25 for one night and then killed them.
That's why you have oranges.
Tom told Mary he was busy.
You're not yelling at me like that.
I love books in English.
I'm not with you anymore!
Tom thought Mary was having fun.
I don't have any idea about these little things.
You're Tom's mother?
They didn't tell me where we were going.
Tom's a bad guy, isn't he?
What have you done?
Do you have any?
It's one thing in the world, and it's ignorance.
I want you to be in the hospital tomorrow.
You need to save the girl.
You know them very well.
Don't keep the bike in the barn.
I don't know if I can give you your Aunt Mary or not.
The pine trees can be about three feet [2 m].
Come on, tell me.
We didn't justify it.
Let him have his hands.
I'm allergic to your dog.
Julia is the capital city.
You're obviously tired.
You didn't take secrets.
A lot of things happened.
I'd like to.
Avella's gone.
I'm old, you too.
They're the only ones.
He's been looking for me, man.
Have you done this before?
I don't think you're the one who's done it.
He's doing his best.
Tom was a extortioner.
Tom had power.
Do you want me to drive you on the couch?
He wants her.
I'm sorry.
Tom and Mary embraced.
Tom's eyes are full of tears.
Tom's gone.
She's with him.
In this I want to be born a deadly family.
I'll have a wig.
Let's get her.
It's good advertising.
Tomorrow I'll take care of you.
Jenny, could you repeat what you said?
Who told you?
I thought you were.
I helped him.
Did you apologize to her?
I got him.
I know exactly where to find Tom.
Do you have a word?
He'll take you like he did.
Did you realize that my method was wrong?
School's nine and nine.
I was naked.
Friday, Friday.
It's not fashionable.
I don't want to take care of it.
Two hundred species.
I asked Tom if he wanted to go to Boston.
I clean before I go to bed.
Tom has to tell the truth.
Don't walk in the park!
Tom didn't take Facebook.
I can't talk about it.
You're gonna make it up.
It's pretty good.
You know, it's not like you clean people up a couple of times a day.
That's all I've ever done.
You can go after Tom.
I sent Tom.
I'm worried about it.
I'm on my way.
You want me to pay your bills?
It's gonna be okay, don't worry!
How could you be such a fool?
Are you all crazy?
You should have been there.
Father's gone.
Mary says she's allergic to girls.
That's not what I said.
You're a candidate for a job.
Tom couldn't stand it.
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary.
Ask Tom if he'll come back.
I know that, Tom's at the office.
What people don't get upside down?
Tom and Mary are all at home.
I don't want to kill you.
Tom's already got French.
I've been under a lot of pressure.
Take your gun off.
Mary took the purse.
He was so poor that he had nothing to buy.
That made us happy.
She's already done it.
"Bless you God." "I'm an atheist."
It's going to be from Tom.
I took it from the first man.
Tell me what you ate for lunch.
Lock him down.
He prayed to God, and he blessed me.
I'm on my way.
It's hard to understand.
He caught me off guard, I didn't know what I was talking about.
We need to go.
Tom will give Mary everything she needs.
Good luck.
Who started it all?
We're not planning on it.
He's called "The Frequent-K-Time."
It's real.
What are you doing?
I'm glad the sky is beautiful.
Did you get my letters?
Tom's an anecdote.
Hi, Mimi, how's it going?
I don't have enough.
I loved you.
They're idiots.
Heather's the only one.
Mary said she was alone.
Tom took control.
I was mad at myself.
The boys didn't take him.
You're calling me from her house.
I took him out of the house.
You're not the same in the world.
Turn to the right.
The students.
I was worried about the whole thing.
My wife is Spanish.
I've known him for years.
Tom asked Mary to turn the light out.
We're going to talk to Tom of our own.
He's what I'm telling him.
Thomas, they're gonna kill him.
I took a ride and pressed the button.
It was a lot of fun.
I'm glad you did.
How was your night?
My carpenter.
She's taken off herself.
I'm blind.
I want to go to Hawaii in summer.
That's it!
You don't have that much money.
Mary was in my house.
Tom realized that he had spoken a lot.
I didn't do that.
Betty killed her mother.
They got up, got him.
What did you think I didn't do?
The capital is Paris.
Let me talk to her.
They're dead.
The sugar's in the water.
I read it on Facebook.
Tom didn't tell me.
I believe him.
It's a good thing to do it.
Tom's in charge of the hospital.
Don't make me crazy.
Tom's got one.
I'm ready for you.
How's your wife, Tom?
We're planning on it.
Cut Tom's name off the list.
Tom's gone.
So I have to get a haircut.
It was dark green.
Tom wasn't dumb enough to tell Mary.
She told me she didn't eat pork.
Now you're out of town.
Tom learned the word.
She spoke English.
I'm glad you're here, Tom.
Did she read the book?
Are you in the hospital for news from the office?
You need breakfast.
So what do you know?
Tom didn't come, and I didn't.
Choose.
He's the one who did it.
It was fun laughing.
You've got it.
I'm tired.
Tom and Mary, like everyone else, were losing their lives.
Tell them it's okay.
You'd be a great match for the office.
How's Tom doing?
We gave her a lot of apples.
I'm not naive.
I didn't tell her you were here.
Can you take Tom for a moment?
I should've told Tom he'd been on the table.
Jenny, wish me a favor.
I'm glad I'm alive.
Tom took me to the parking lot.
I didn't mean to make him cry.
I took Mary before she took me.
I'm sorry I told him that.
Tom told me he really wanted to eat.
I'm not going to walk anymore.
You got Rubik's cube?
My weight is fifty-fifty.
I'm on my feet.
Would you like us to meet Tom?
I don't want her.
I'm not going to take Tom to the hospital.
I'm a Viterin.
You're not fooling me.
Do you like it?
She did.
Tom is not, I'm afraid of him.
Drive straight along the road.
Winter's coming.
My husband was a soldier at the depot.
I was there when Tom died.
Tom's gone yet?
You can buy a ticket.
I'm very proud of you.
I was joking.
I don't know if Tom has a bicycle or not.
Don't let me go.
I love a lot of things.
I don't think you need to do that.
Tom's a good guy.
It's not his wife.
We can't be taken any more.
Did I do that?
I don't think I'm going to take that.
I have to find her.
We needed Tom's help.
Breathe through the nose.
Take a look at it from your point of view.
Tom didn't swim.
He has a literary talent.
God damn it!
Bring them in.
Tom thought you were Mary.
Tom knew I wasn't doing it.
I was lucky.
Tom's got a job.
I didn't want them.
He's working.
Does it hurt?
I'm wasting a lot of money, locks.
We all love you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm not.
I don't smoke or go.
She's here.
The police didn't tell Tom.
I knew you wouldn't get it.
No critics.
Tell me it's not a bomb.
I don't want to bump into Tom.
I took the train.
I'm clapping.
I've been watering.
Tom got away.
She's talking about you all the time.
I respect you and Tom.
I fell asleep in the car.
Tom took himself.
I thought you were busy.
Can we do it?
You're crazy.
Tom cleans at least three times a day.
Tom and his wife.
Let's do our thing, let's go further.
She gave me the day.
Tom sold his car to Mary for 300 bucks.
What did that mean?
You should have told me.
I have a coffin in my garden.
He's working.
I'm looking for a cat.
I had to go to her place.
Enjoy the Mongols!
Who's gonna take my liver?
We'll get him.
Mary's got her keys.
She took him to my office.
The worst and the worst friend is the best friend.
Tom wanted to, because Mary had prepared something for him.
Don't wait for me.
Tom didn't.
Excuse me for a second.
We didn't.
Tom knew he was.
I know you won't.
I don't think that makes any difference.
We took a trip to the lake.
I didn't know who you were.
She's reading her favorite book.
Tom's gone.
Rabbits can swim.
I've got a lot on my hands.
She's got a chance on her.
One meter, you're going to have one Wattwatt, and it's not easy at the moment to figure out a solar limit on a scale.
Who's Tom?
That car?
I have one call for you.
The station's ten minutes away.
Who do you think you are?
Shake the cat.
Tom's busy, you're not in charge.
What's your deal?
We might be offended.
I'm sure he's coming.
Go and ask him.
Let me see.
Partial self-interest is a drop in the sea.
I made a deal with Tom.
I wish I had a car.
I've become a girl.
Tom didn't sleep the other day.
Tom had an umbrella.
Why did you shave your beard?
It's handmade.
Tom's staying with Mary.
Tom didn't get used to it.
She's got a lot of work to do.
Give me the cricket.
Did you tell Tom that you didn't take him?
It's not like ice cream in summer.
I've seen her do the piano.
I knew Tom wouldn't go.
Do you like driving?
The car didn't move.
Mary was wrong.
She's a little bit of a girl.
We're going to go.
Tom's in the park with his wife.
She spoke to me.
So you shouldn't have lied to Mary.
The baby's in a cottage.
I didn't tell them you were here.
Tom erased it and rewritten it.
You could have hurt yourself.
Get out of here.
You don't smoke while you're gone.
Tom wanted to go to the Poker with us, but Mary didn't want him to.
Tom didn't take it all, he felt sorry for Mary's cooking.
I think the car's already broken.
Tom Mike?
I'd like to be Canadian.
That's pretty good.
We're all praying for it.
You didn't want to talk about her.
Just give me a hand.
You're not going to Boston?
You're free to go with her, just like you are.
Have you ever done anything?
She left before I went home.
Tom wasn't who he was.
You could at least knock!
You've done it.
I think you've had a hard time.
He's a good guy.
I can't believe we're going to have a job.
I'm not so good at this.
You got Tom.
I got her.
Papiamento is the minister.
I don't want a haircut.
I believe in the first man.
Did you find them?
I'm eating a bite.
I didn't take them.
Tom changed his mind.
I'd like to talk to her.
I thought you weren't with him anymore.
It's a good journal.
It's been a lot of time.
We'll get married tomorrow.
She was right, and he's wrong.
They drew lots to whom they would take.
Guess we're on his way.
Kzeli, it's done.
Tom didn't come.
He said he was cold.
I'm going to spend time with my wife.
I didn't know you were Canadians.
You're going to put your finger on the moon, and you're going to do the same with the dog, and it's going to be on your finger.
Tom took a beer.
Tom didn't want to.
I'm sure I haven't seen her.
I didn't know who I was.
I didn't know it wasn't Tom.
It took four and a half in 1940.
At the end of the year.
Stay away from the fire.
Did you not know them?
Tom wrote me a letter from John.
"Salms are fickle," said a girl.
I want it, too.
Tom used to tell me.
Did Tom take that coat?
Don't forget about it.
Do you think that's for you?
How am I going to get there?
Tom says he's gonna hurt it.
I'll put it in here.
It's a novelty for me.
Tom wants you to help him out.
She's got a lot of tension.
Tom speaks the same language.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
A tiger of lilies sprouted in the garden.
I told her not to.
I don't think Tom's the one who's got it.
We've come to see you.
Did you take his name?
Tom put his slugs in a box.
I don't want you to go.
He said he was coming.
"Doctor, I'm all over." "Next!"
He's got one thing in his house for a job.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.
You have a letter.
Tom's grandfather wasn't here.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said he told her.
Have I been with you?
Give him the phone.
Tom stayed at the hospital.
I gave her this.
Tom is indecisive.
Nucleus baton!
I'll put mine away, I'll take care of it.
Everything is perfect.
There's something I want with you.
That's the best I've ever seen.
It'll make me hear.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you there?
It's been ten years since my mother died.
I'm on the move.
Make yourself available.
Are you in?
She didn't work.
I didn't want to be naked.
It's an operation.
Will Tom be at the hospital?
I want you to go with her.
I'll make him pay.
You've got them.
I'm waiting for you in Turin!
You're not tired.
I will pray.
What do you think you're doing?
Tom said he did the same thing.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
The gold fever of California gold, which began in 1848.
You know Tom didn't bring Mary?
I'd like to see you.
I've been meeting people all day.
I want to go with him.
You let Tom down.
What are you doing in the hospital?
We miss Tom.
He's got his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I held his collar.
You're not allowed to do that.
I'm aware that I am.
Come on, come on!
Tom was bitten by a dog.
I know you're early.
Tom, it's this morning.
I'm sorry.
To the east and west of the city is a river.
What are you doing?
Do you know someone who speaks English?
Is that why it was scary?
Tom took me to bed.
I don't think Tom is.
I'd like you to.
I'm impressed with your French.
We both did.
It's hot, it's hot.
We could have done that.
The doctor said that Tom needed an operation.
I've been doing some toothpaste recently.
Here's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom's realist.
Who's knocking at me?
What are you and Tom doing?
I've sent you.
I'm an amoeboy.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom's on the top virgin.
I've been listening to him.
You didn't do anything?
Did he come to you with anything?
Are you going to kill us?
I heard you crying.
Let me see how it feels!
Everyone's quiet.
You'll be dead.
Are you so crazy?
He was incarcerated in his teacher's office, but with all the hormones, he was trapped in the hospital.
I'm glad I'm cured.
I wrote a lot of esperanto.
I'm more interested in the aquarel than in the pastoral.
I can't do it.
He's a friend.
I can find them.
I've done it.
You're entitled to a lawyer.
Don't stay close to the hospital.
I've been washing my head for the last day.
By the way, he didn't give up.
Did you steal it?
She's mad at me.
You're not here, Tom.
My husband likes a junkie, just like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan pretended to be a champion of the supremacy of the world.
I'll get them out of here.
I've got some shirts.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks English.
I wouldn't believe it.
I don't know what I'm doing.
She asked me if she was on the phone.
Tom will take care of me.
It floats like an axe.
Tom didn't tell Mary what to buy him.
She brought the broom.
"Tom, hurry." "I'm coming!"
I've got a problem.
We're not.
We've already met.
I'm going to say it in English.
I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two people to a concert.
He likes to brag about his company.
She's wearing her glasses.
Come on, Emilia, get your father.
How long have you been in front of your computer?
Tom's been walking.
Minus plus.
There's a corpse in the hospital.
Please send a donation.
I need to talk to you.
It's been a long time.
I've found it.
Ancara is capital city.
I went to the mill.
I've taken my approach.
They're cool.
I'm talking about having a girlfriend.
Goodbye Jane was very sad to us.
I'm trying not to.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You're a smart guy.
I'm grateful for that.
He couldn't hold back the kid.
Did you say "girl" or "boyfriend"?
I didn't take them.
That's knowing that you didn't know that you didn't know.
Tom Mary.
You were good at it, but you took her.
Tom says he's not marrying Mary.
I've taken two days.
I think that's Tom's.
Tom's pale.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is a friend of mine.
Should I come too?
Is Tom in charge of staying in the city?
Interrogation.
Let's go.
He didn't seem to be sure of it.
I've heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take your jacket off, you're warm.
There's so much.
He couldn't compromise his principles.
Mary says she's alone.
You've got three hours to do that.
It was easy.
Mary said she was coming.
I want a restaurant.
Are you buying lottery?
That's everybody.
It's not like you're alone.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You're an ostrich.
Tom told Mary about the reception.
They're not humans.
Tom's gifted to a rich man.
She's a problem.
Tell the truth.
I don't want Tom to sing at my wedding.
That's all about it.
I didn't have any names in my clothes.
Tom's clean.
It's three books for Tom.
He jumped from one to the other.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's in.
It's not cold.
I wore Tom's shirt.
Looks like the bank had a plan for little things.
That's why he didn't do it, but he bought it anyway.
Hold on for a while.
I want to talk to you about something.
The can's empty.
You didn't show Tom?
Isn't the weather nice?
We'll be there through.
I was bathing in the river.
I'll tell them, they've taken off the phone.
Are you going to tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher?
Don't force me to kill you!
Do you want more of this or that?
They don't respect him.
Jonah's not here.
I want you to be the one you were.
Don't piss us off.
You don't have to.
Tom's got a lot of books.
Can you get alligator from a crocodile?
Jenny, what is this?
My grandfather's got a house.
Are you okay with that?
You've done it.
I did it.
I went to Australia, and I was there.
You did, I told Tom that you killed his wife?
I'm looking for your teacher.
I'm your father.
What am I doing on my own?
All the people were touched by him.
Do you know how that is?
He's gone.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to be with him.
How old is Tony?
Did I take a shower this morning?
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Is it wood or wood?
I'm sorry!
I took Tom as my friend.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,
Tom's gonna breathe.
Dogs don't say anything.
Tom poured water out of the bottle, but it's water on top of it.
Dogs are squirrel dogs.
Tom's house was the only one.
You're so stupid.
Tom, why don't you speak English?
There's two men on the lake.
I'm not calling you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
You're the only one I've ever had.
It's a lot of stuff.
They've got a lot of eyes on them.
I know that one of you is Tom the lazy one.
Tell Tom he didn't do that anymore.
Are you crazy?
I'll stop you.
I think he's a species.
Come on.
We're in the Hilton Company.
So tell Mary the truth.
I'm going to be alone when you leave.
Tom wanted a box, but I got Mary.
She complained that she didn't do anything.
Don't you think you're going to bring Tom?
Something needs to be done.
She gave it to him.
Mary's in her hospital.
Hey!
That second, I fell in love with language.
Tom's in the hospital?
You're the one who did it?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom is my friend.
I don't know what I'm up to.
You can't go to the woods alone.
You didn't have to cry.
Tom overslept.
You're the one who did it.
I'm glad you're done.
She's a handkerchief, many times.
Tom won't be with anyone.
I'll tell them you came by.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home with her.
I'm happy to be with you.
I didn't really know about them.
They had a lot of money.
He took me.
Put your hands up!
It's all right that we haven't done it.
I thought Tom hadn't been to Boston.
She was five years old.
We're sorry about the noise management.
I won't let you do that.
I don't think they've got us.
I thought you'd do that.
Selfishness is one of the virtues.
You'll see him for a year.
There's not a single book on TV.
It's all over the place, it's all over.
You could have stayed in Boston.
It's not there.
Can you take that chirganous, huh?
We don't think it's a sign.
You don't feel like I do.
Behave yourself.
You got a juggle?
Did you kill your wife?
We're gonna welcome you.
Tom wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I can't stand the look of a woman.
I'm sorry, Dad's gonna make me sick.
Sally made her brother clean the toilet.
Mary reigns in the city.
The conference room is busy.
Potato chips are worth the money.
It's not like yours.
I'm waiting for you.
I've never seen you like that.
He's on the move.
I think Tom's right.
It's boring.
Are you crazy?
Ask Tom.
Grab the backpack!
That's what you used to say.
Tom says he's not hungry.
That's what happened.
Can't we get her?
The artery was brought to the hospital.
I'm absolutely crazy.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's easy.
What's going on with our wives, the nuclear power?
I told them the bank didn't go.
Tom and I have become friends.
He's got a lot of things.
I thought Tom was your friend.
I feel so sorry for Tom.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm on my way.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
Tom didn't tell us what he was doing.
I knew it was him.
Tom's here.
That's not what I'm doing.
That's what you used to say.
I know that more than anyone.
I don't know what Tom is.
I knew it was something like that.
You got it, didn't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom is very young.
It's paid for the first number of bills.
I'm terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
To me, Boston is a cold city, not like Chicago.
Tom was a ransom.
I can't speak for my colleagues.
Is Tom far from you?
I'm not dead?
It's a fight.
I didn't take it.
Tom's gone.
I'd like to.
You've done the wrong thing.
They took a lot of risks.
We have a cat.
You don't want to walk anymore.
He was a good man.
Tom wants us.
You weren't home?
Someone's got it, Tom.
I'll meet you because of the typhoon.
Tom's got a diagnosis in 2013
There's a cart along the way with mules.
Tom speaks English with the kids, and Tom speaks English with the kids.
I don't think Tom's got a ticket to buy.
Tom was hard to find.
Everybody's dancing!
I live with Tom.
That's where I put them.
You don't miss it.
Your problem is you don't get it.
They've identified the first one.
Stop that, Tom.
Tom said he didn't.
It was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told Tom he took him to Australia.
I think you could have done that.
Tom said he didn't say anything about it.
He got out of bed.
It's on the way.
I paid for Tom.
A lot of people who don't get confused.
Tom's got me out of here?
Are you going to be in charge?
What's your motive?
Lady Layle herself is his computer.
Roll your sleeves.
I'm sure you'll come back.
Hey, Tom, are you with us?
That in America, I'm going to be president, but that's not the case.
Tom's not for Mary.
It's Tom's name.
What have you missed?
Mary's gonna die.
Do you have a ride?
Are you in Boston?
You didn't?
You gave me a ride.
Tom didn't know that Mary and John were with each other.
If I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I made him a cookie.
It's a good thing.
I called my wife.
She didn't?
Can I drive?
You don't think Tom told me!
I'll give you a hard time.
Translate it to the puberty, girl.
Eat the steel!
Hey, take a cab.
The crowds are on their way.
Mary told me she loved me.
It's Tom who told me what he was doing.
Coss and kill it.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very cold.
We got you!
She's a lover of all sorts.
She's with Tom's girlfriend.
Tom's weak.
So I'll pay you for it.
I didn't know.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his propellant beard.
Have you seen my dog?
Don't worry about it.
I didn't see you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he's gonna hurt her.
You'll be back.
We've already talked.
I don't think I've succeeded.
Tom didn't know Mary.
The test is light.
You just don't tell me?
Are you crazy?
I don't know, it's a book.
Tom didn't understand.
Tom didn't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white boy shirt.
It's me.
I got it.
It was a girl, not a kid.
Who-who knew them?
They're following you.
Did you get it?
I think Tom got me.
That's what we can do.
He's talking about them.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's dressed in a hospital.
We went to a restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom doesn't ask for help.
Tom didn't tell Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of broad spaces in this town.
What are you doing?
Have you ever been to Boston?
They're going to get married.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She didn't take me.
You didn't tell Tom?
She's got a son of a bitch.
We can't get people to do this.
Let me carry it.
I think that's Tom.
I hate it.
Did they sleep?
We're on it.
I don't think he's still not married.
I didn't know what you knew.
I won't let her do it.
We were spared.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I went to the hospital.
I didn't talk to Tom.
I'm saying we can't take Tom.
She's got her own.
I wonder why Tom needs it.
It made me feel better.
I looked like you didn't say that.
What are you doing in the middle of the night?
Tom's not from Boston.
Will you back me up?
Why don't you get the plan?
I thought you were on your way.
You're the one who did it.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or a friend?
It's a picture of me.
What happened?
We're here.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter's coming soon.
The titles and titles mean nothing to me.
Did you find him?
She's gone.
I'll tell you.
Is it good to have a girl?
Tom drinks beer.
Don't do it!
Tom had a job.
Is that good or not?
You didn't?
I'm on my way.
Bring Tom.
What are you doing with this?
Pull yourself together!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She's stuck with me.
He said we'd get lost.
I can't take him home.
You should have told Tom that you were being rude.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to the house.
I don't know about her.
Tom was a cab driver who lived in Boston.
Tom's gone.
He won't take the camera.
I've done it, I've done it to Tom.
I'll connect you to her.
She's a good girl.
Tom's in trouble.
I think you're busy.
Are you happy to have your name?
I was in a hurry.
I did it for the best.
There are people who need your help.
You can do that.
I was scared.
Tom's a polished jack.
I'd like to lie down.
Lend me a notebook or something like that.
I don't want to leave home.
He'll be fine.
The cat's dead.
Is it half the way?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I can't talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
There's a lake floating in the lake.
I hit my finger.
Tom wanted to talk to me.
Tom didn't do well.
She put herself in her arms to warm them up.
Tom said he was happy to have you back.
My car is full of pigeon shit.
Tom didn't know about it.
Tom's Mary's adorned.
Is Laurie home?
I fought for Tom.
I won't make it any more.
I don't care if we don't.
I talked her into him.
I've been working all day.
What did you do to you?
He sold out?
I'm in the corkscrew myself.
It wasn't him.
Do you have a chat in Mexico?
You're the one who gave it to her.
Mary's gone.
Tom wanted to take her to the hospital.
Will you go to the concert with me?
Are you in?
If I had a gun, I'd come to see you.
I don't know her phone number.
What's the umbrella?
I can't tell you.
You're photogenic.
Read the book!
That's not true.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom will see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do that for you.
"Wow," said Tom timidly.
Where are you going?
I almost died.
I've got a lot of trouble.
She didn't have any.
I don't think Tom's in charge.
They're running.
There's no way to drive cars through it.
You're afraid of a dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't come to school.
I was somewhere.
Do you have any problems?
They'll translate him.
You're not working.
Are you gonna see me for a second?
Everybody loved me.
He and I are souls.
I have a granddaughter.
I'm sorry I destroyed your company.
I didn't get a job.
Is that honey?
How did you get along with him?
I didn't talk to her.
She's got a new idea.
We'll take care of it.
I'm assuming you're sitting on the office.
I've found it.
It's an early drink, isn't it?
My parents don't like my manners.
Whoever wants to stay, stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him gently and hard.
Is that why it's wrong?
It's not expensive.
Hold your hand?
He's pretty good.
Tom made a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants a cake once?
Tom's been up all night.
Come on!
You went to prison.
You're young, you're talking about cellulose.
It's all over the season.
It's expensive.
Where do you go for a ride?
You went to the hairdresser?
The perspective is depressing.
I thought you wouldn't ask.
Give me the ball handle.
It's a way of saying that it's Tom's way.
I didn't sleep.
She was afraid of being alone.
You'll find your way out of here.
Get lost.
Are you sure you're doing this?
Let's all take a picture.
I failed at the hospital.
Everybody knew about it.
You'd have gone to help her.
A football player.
They're doing the same thing?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom's gone.
I'm sorry about one.
Tom says it's done.
You're not who I am.
I've shaken my heart.
Tom Mary, and they hugged her.
That's my cat.
Do you have any children yet?
Tom didn't want to have a breakfast.
They've got Tom.
Tom didn't believe it, they put him out of jail.
Tom is a presumptuous idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to the hospital.
I'm guessing you need help.
Don't look at me!
I moved to Boston in France.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom, what you're saying is what you're doing.
Don't look at me like that.
The road is on the right side of the curve.
Tom's not busy.
Have you seen Tom?
Didn't you talk about talking to Tom?
I'm not going to send you any more.
You're not doing it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think you're going to have a hard time.
Let's go to the hospital.
Tom wiped the whiskey.
Was Jenoko there?
He's on the move.
That's the nicest thing I've ever done.
What was he worth?
I love you.
I'm not hungry.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks are coming.
I'm the same, I was the same.
Do you know that guy who's crying?
I didn't know anything about it.
It's just amazing.
He said I didn't.
The thief will steal the cow too.
Tom isn't a good swimmer?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went to the dining room.
He was a self-efficient man.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom in this case doesn't want to come with us to Boston.
Don't give them anything.
It's all over the place.
What day was that?
Let's get Tom one chance.
I just want you to put me the way I am.
I've done it.
Wake me up before I wake up.
Is that true?
Why don't you go in there?
Tom didn't say he was coming with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I are on the move.
I've been talking about it.
I'm not doing this anymore.
What do you prefer?
Here's my experience.
You're not with us.
I've seen the car crash.
It's a window.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I won't throw away my Playstation.
I don't want to, Tom saw me like that.
Come on!
Do you have a TV program?
Do you want me to go to bed tomorrow?
You're welcome.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
I love going to school.
I've done my best.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
I need you to take care of me.
Her wife's a lawyer.
I want a volcano.
I know who it is.
The dog's yours.
What do you mean?
You can't help it.
Tell Tom I'll come by his house the day before he's gone.
You took care of them.
It's an orange.
What can I do to punish you?
I'm on it.
You don't know what you're doing?
I didn't want to kill him.
The officer instilled in them the courage.
Tom didn't take it.
In fact, I'm thinking about trying the best.
I'm not a hunter.
I'm cooking at home on the Grill.
You're running away from me.
Why would you do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary, if it were important.
Do you have umbrellas?
You're a gentleman.
Tom became famous.
It's already been done.
You've got to destroy your office.
You didn't.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, I'm sure I will.
I wonder what Tom means.
I already knew that.
I didn't talk to Tom.
That's what she said.
Who's got you?
I don't want to go with you.
I've seen him on you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom's home.
She was the one I thought she was.
Tom told my law officer.
I'm cutting my hair.
I told you I didn't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to beat them up.
It's an apple that's sour.
There were a lot of people.
Give me the catalog.
That was expensive.
Let's not talk about sex.
I don't know who she is.
You're gonna go to the nanny tomorrow, I'm gonna go too.
You're going to work for the house?
Prometheus has set a sacred fire on the gods.
Welcome to the world.
I'd like to, we could spend more time with you.
I know like Tom.
They got out of the bus, whatever it is.
I want you to meet this guy.
You speak the language of me.
There's a lot of people in this town, but Tom doesn't want them.
You have six unread files.
Bring your company.
We've got checks.
My bike's gone.
They were dying at night.
I'm sure Tom wins.
"Eh, what do we do?" "It's written, Link will defeat Ghenon." "So what do we do." "Well, I'm going to take my sword, "Micha no." "Ah?" "Ah?" "Ah?" "Ah?" "Ah, "Ah, ah, an ax with a turtle." "No." "Ah." "Ah, "Ah, what do you think?" "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah?" "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah."
Are you the one who sings?
Is that right?
Three o'clock.
I was at your place.
Tom's a swimmer.
You're good at it.
I took her on the way home.
I haven't read any of his novels.
Everybody knew Tom was here.
Give me a hammer, will you?
Tom wanted to.
I'm going to Tom's home.
Ken couldn't have killed him.
She said she was looking for her.
Tom helped Mary remove the blankets.
A is a multitude, more from c, b, and a.
I'll be right back.
He's got it.
We can deal with them.
I was just wondering if you'd like to come with us.
Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
Are you in the car?
That's what I was told three hours ago.
I'm here.
French started in Louis XVI.
He's had a good time.
He loved us.
Did you come from Tom?
I want to bathe in the sea.
It's going to get away from him.
I've seen one kid.
He's the one who's done it alone.
I didn't know what to do with him.
Our city was encased.
She didn't see her come out of the hospital.
Two cups of coffee, man.
We talked about you.
You got it?
You can't go without a car.
We'll have a ride tomorrow.
You should have smoked a long time ago.
That's a joke!
You're the only one who's got nothing to do with computers.
You got a bike?
I thought Tom was awake.
So don't take it.
I didn't take them.
Hurry up, Tom.
That's what the teacher says.
She's going to meet Mailyn Munro.
I know who we can take care of.
I'm better than you.
She's looking at the living room.
I don't think Tom's doing it.
I swear I didn't see her.
I loved him.
Tom and I nodded.
It's hard to get, but it's easy to get.
You're gonna act like a child!
Let's go.
They're in the middle of a curse.
Don't move him.
Tom wants a ride.
I didn't take her.
What did I do with Tom?
I think it was your fault.
You think it's an image of an image?
I'm going to do what I do, I'm going to be killed.
It's the same thing, and it's not going to be lost.
Tom's gone to the hospital.
I couldn't teach you anything.
I didn't pay them any money.
Let's hope that's the last time.
Yours means mine isn't.
Are you sure Tom is doing this?
"F = ma" is Newton's law.
What are you against?
He did it.
I'm gonna clean some tails.
Is Tom okay?
I said yes.
Ciao, Tom's a better man than I am.
I don't know much about Tom.
I can't pay him.
I've been pumping the press all day, you can kind of take his relief.
Tom wants to go.
Tom was alone.
Tom's with me.
It's a shame to take someone over who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one. is the one. is the the the the the the one. the one. the one. the one. the one who's the one who's the one. the one. the one. the one. the one. the one. the one. the one. the one. the one who's the one. the one. the one. the one. the one. the one. the one. the one. the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one. the one. the one. the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one.
Tom's mad at you for lying to him.
Ten years later, our city was devastated.
Did you get our wedding cake?
Tom was there three times.
That's my scarf.
I'm afraid I am.
There's a lot of teachers in Vienna.
You're welcome.
How do you two manage?
I didn't want to, you knew.
It's hard, but it's good.
Both water and water are for life.
He's coming through the gate.
Our Father, thou art in heaven. Holy be the commandment, that the kingdom come, that thy will be done, as in heaven and upon heaven. Our bread of the day be given us nothing: and leave us our way, even as we are by our means: and lead us not into the house, but deliver us from the wicked one.
Are you brave?
Is there a subway?
I can stay, I can stay.
Tom knew Mary was in danger.
I was overwhelmed.
I thought I was wrong.
I don't know, the bridge's been bridged for years.
Are you out of your way tonight?
I went to Microsoft.
I eat a lot.
The wind in Saturn is blowing with 1,800 times.
It's not for anything.
I want you to know that everything you said was recorded in the document.
Tom moved the car, taking it from the bar to the bar.
If you don't, you'll die.
We're doing the same thing, the same thing, the same thing.
I'll take you.
I live on the Park Home.
It'll be good for you.
I didn't let her go home.
Did Tom see you at the hospital?
She's been in the hospital all day.
Do you know what Tom is doing?
"Hey Zelda, how's it going?" "Yes, Hank."
He got away from me.
Tom sat down on the table.
It's your dog.
That's why I'm working.
You want some cake?
I've had my back.
I don't know yet.
What am I supposed to do with you?
That's not true.
I'm going to turn the light out.
And you?
You're the one who's not!
Do you have any?
You're welcome.
It was forged.
I'll send tea.
There's a lot of cars in that car.
We've taken care of her.
Tom's the guy.
I've been looking for you.
There's a pigeon on it.
I appreciate how you define your name.
I'll take care of it this time.
Two days later, Tom died.
Everybody shut up and stared at me.
I'm telling you to change.
I'm a dog.
I'm in Boston.
How are you, who is he?
I took a walk on the beach this morning.
Would you be on your way?
Dad just got used to it.
It's a novel about what I've been reading on TV.
I can't swim.
I've got a monster under my arm.
I thought you loved Tom.
Algeria was named after the capital of the capital, which was named after the capital of the country, which was named after the capital of the country, which was named after the capital of the country, which was named after the capital of the country, which was ten yards from the old city of Ukraine, and was named after the capital of their kingdom in the tenth century.
Are you all right?
She did it.
Are you going home?
There was Tom in the hospital, and there was a molester.
It's a way to get the mayor of Gabriel-Royter, who's intuitive, who's intuitive.
I know you're over there.
I'm sure Tom and Mary won't drink beer.
Who's going to be the apple?
What's your name?
Tom won't pay for it.
I've got a good job.
Tom walks around a lot.
You're ours.
Did you show me this?
What was I like?
I think it's good to be good.
Are you really Tom?
Will you come tonight?
You didn't know Tom was on Park Street?
I told Mary I'd go to Boston with her.
Are you sure he doesn't have a gun?
Tom goes to the nick.
He's a cataholic.
I admired your name.
We've done it.
I know by nature that this is the way.
It's all right.
How many do you know?
I'm taking him to the hospital.
You're not gonna ask Tom for you and Mary?
What are you doing?
There was a lot of it.
He's making his way to the city.
Tom said he wanted to go.
You'd love to buy yourself a dog in that store.
I felt good.
I need you.
I don't think Tom's gonna tell us that.
There's a cat on the ground.
How did you convince him?
I got used to it early.
He'll make me feel better.
Tom's taking a trip to the attic.
I'm cold, I don't taste.
Somebody stole my suitcase.
They're not, we're not, we're not.
Couldn't we just talk?
Mike didn't go to basketball.
Where are you taking him?
We can ask Tom for help.
She's lying to you.
I've got my name.
He's getting up early.
You're out of your mind?
That's why it wasn't done.
Oh, and Sergey Nazarowitz Bukka, isn't it?
Tom, what Mary doesn't hurt.
She's taking the dog home.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
I don't have my hands.
He wants you to help him.
The supermarkets in the city, huh?
Who's taking charge of this?
Are we going to sit down?
Tom sent himself a cup of tea.
Come on, Tom.
Named a flight to Kharma.
Looks like Tom's not leaving.
You won't have a problem.
You can't do that.
Tom didn't know Mary had him.
I've been there a lot.
You got us?
Tom got me.
It's cold.
I've been working for a few days.
I'm sorry.
The police are on the scene.
I'm glad you're coming.
I wish I could, but I can't do much more.
I argued with Tom about marijuana.
Tom did what he could, but he couldn't do anything better than Mary's.
What's your plan?
I didn't do it to her.
I don't know who's in charge of the house.
Tom sat on the log.
I'm sorry.
Tom doesn't look like any of them.
I cough, I cough, I cough, and I have a blood vessel in my butterfly.
They've got dogs.
Just tell me where he is.
Show him your hands.
I want to talk to you.
You should come too.
Tom's noise.
You didn't tell me?
Give it to them yourself.
I haven't looked at him since, I wonder what he did.
I want to talk to Tom.
The capital is Kiev.
Tom mourned the death of the dog's dog.
We're the same.
Italy won't drink coffee.
Are you sure he's here?
I don't hate Tom anymore.
We have a cat and a dog.
The operation on his throat helped him get away with pneumonia, but put him out of control.
You've got a lot of money.
I was overwhelmed by the subject of him.
I don't know how it is.
Soldiers used sand bags.
I wanted to.
There's no way.
Let Tom go.
Tom's got blinds, and the guards couldn't get in.
I got lost in Boston.
Grab him!
You're welcome to surrender.
We all loved them.
Go back to Tom.
Jane's gone.
I just want you to shut up for a minute.
You won't let me.
Coffee, fuck, it's expensive.
She's a good girl.
We'll get you.
It's for me.
I'm learning to drive.
I know it's true.
It's hot this morning.
Tom's done.
We're gonna have to go because we're not gonna get a ticket.
You're doing it to him, too?
I can see you're not.
Noise on my nerves.
Tell Tom I'd like to know.
What are you doing?
We have worse things.
I mean, I'm sure Tom told me.
You're gonna have to cut your legs.
I've heard a lot of sounds, and I've heard it from him.
My mother was good at the piano.
That's why I'm going to take care of it.
I'm sorry.
He wasn't like that, he was.
You need to talk to me about it.
What am I doing here?
Drink water.
I'd like more.
Tom wasn't familiar with Mary.
My wife didn't want me to.
Have you ever seen Tom at school?
We found that all the boxes were packed.
Ask her to come tomorrow.
I didn't touch the police.
That's what I'm doing.
You've got your back shirt.
I'm afraid I'm not good at this.
Did you win who?
I'm sorry.
Are there same - sex marriages?
Arguments against them.
I'm not asking you.
Let's go back to the motel.
I'm sorry.
Are you dealing with this?
They're here.
Tom never went to Australia.
Tell me you're ready.
We've been doing a lot in three years.
Lend me your dictionary, girl.
It could have been one of us.
We've been wondering what we're doing.
Did you get them?
The enemy is the mind of the phonograph, either against the subject or against the subject of the phonograph.
I'm in my pajamas.
It's just a translation.
It's not beautiful.
I don't think anyone wants to come.
Tom didn't do it.
I just didn't care, did I?
Tom often goes to Boston.
I love it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've been doing my whole life.
Go over there tomorrow.
I'm on my way.
I'm worried Tom might get lost.
What's your number?
I want to, I've got a lot of money on my head.
That's why he did it.
They won't be able to kill you.
Tom's got a drink in him.
Be good.
Let's not go in there.
I was honest with him.
He won't tell me what it is.
Can I help you?
It's also been done.
Tom and Mary are three years old.
You and I have done it.
One of those men was Tom.
Tom died in Mary's arms.
That's what I did.
Tom and Mary aren't married.
He said he was happy to see you.
I think you should eat more.
You're not taking me, but I'm taking you.
Did you kill her?
I couldn't believe it.
I just wanted to teach you a lesson.
I don't care if you don't.
Tom, you've got a job.
I'll give you what I know about Tom.
Do you want to check this out?
Ask yourself.
Tom's got a job.
Tom's on his way to see John and Mary.
Do you have a baby in your house?
He'll take care of it.
I'm sure he's alive.
Tom didn't do it.
I'm popular.
What are we going to do?
Did you do all of this?
I thought we were friends.
Tom's on Mary's shoulder.
Have you ever been to a zoo before?
My parents thanked me for that.
She doesn't hate you.
Tom Mary's on the phone.
Give it to me tomorrow morning, girl.
That's all you've done.
Tell her I'm messing with her.
I knew it.
Did you have a problem with that?
Did you think I was going to bring Tom and Mary?
He had a job.
That's what I started doing.
Come on!
He and I are friends.
She's a good girl.
Tom didn't do it that way.
I think you've got it.
I'm using the force.
We had a lot of fun.
I didn't see you laughing.
It's obvious that you love the language.
- Do you want me to?
I bought something.
You're not in any shape, are you?
I read the novels.
It's all my fault.
Tom's a lot of times.
I can get there.
You're eating milk, aren't you?
Tell me what you'll do.
Are you talking about going to Boston?
You'll have to keep it in the hospital.
I've had a good time.
You've done it.
Tom found out.
Let me check it out.
I knew you'd be mad at me.
For poor Tom, it's done.
He took a cab to the station.
Good luck.
Forty-something is present.
It's hot.
I'm afraid I won't make the report.
She said she'd take care of it.
I'll tell him you're in trouble.
They took him to work.
That's the best part.
The students drive him through the stream.
We've got her.
Tom got rich on the sale of car owners.
You're a stable?
I didn't translate it.
It'd be a lot of fun for all of us.
All the apples are cut off.
Are you asking me for help?
I'm really tired.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
It's sand.
I didn't mean it to Tom.
My sister became a pianist.
We've got a bag for Tom.
I've done everything I can.
Mary slapped with her ribbons.
He's broken.
It's a problem, it's hard to deal with.
Tom took two boxes to the hospital.
She's more than I am.
Well, that's good.
He's got it himself.
One of the best countries in the world.
You could at least take a shower.
I'm sure Tom will thank you.
Do you love your cute little dog?
Come on, you've been looking for me.
I'm wonderful about this.
We're the same.
Do you have any of them yet?
I nodded and nodded.
Just sign it.
Tom said Mary's stupid.
What a treat!
We've got five men in there.
Tom says he's on his own.
It's unlocked.
One time!
Tom is a little older than me.
I'm a reporter.
You didn't know who took it?
What did Tom do?
Underneath the parking lot is the car.
Tom took it from the hospital and turned into it.
Have I met you?
Tom didn't become Mary.
It's not like you did.
I have some presents.
No matter where he goes.
The dog's got him.
You're not staying.
It's a lion.
I don't like sports.
You're not my fault.
I thought he was in Mexico.
The teacher told us that the test would take place.
I'm not running like a coward.
I'm filming.
He conquered her.
I wanted you.
Delicateness.
I don't understand how I do it.
I'm getting married at the hospital.
You're not going to the concert with me?
Tom's on a date?
I don't think Tom knew what he was doing.
Try not to.
Tell him you were at the end of the day.
I didn't go to Fudzlamma.
What are you doing like that?
She's not home.
I was a part - time minister.
Kate has any other student in the school.
We got him.
I know his name.
I'm staying with her.
It's hers.
Selfishness is self-efficient.
How's it going?
Are you talking to Tom?
I don't know much about it.
You know, I've got to go to Boston or something.
I have your key.
Did you get a box?
I see what I see, and I see it?
It's not under any circumstances.
Did you save someone's life?
What's with the plume?
Did you find it?
Don't wake me up.
It's not over.
It was stopped by a river.
That's why we need help.
He's got us all.
Did you know that Tom wasn't here?
I promise you my point.
You know what I mean.
I had the seventh night, but I didn't.
What's this about?
What are you talking about?
I think Tom's squeaky.
They wouldn't let me go.
How do you do that?
I gave you what you asked.
Boston's gone.
My husband is a restaurant.
Tom's in the barbecue.
He turned his back on me.
I went to Boston.
I love fries.
That's why I didn't have to tell anyone my name.
You're getting old.
You've got a house.
I went to prison.
We won't hurt you.
We didn't do it!
Did you get it?
I'll get you brandy.
I'm sorry about that one time.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I'd like to give you a favor.
I went like Tom on the piano.
Now I'm coming?
That's not what I ordered.
Tom's sorry?
They're Tom's.
Do you like skating?
Did you go to the concert?
Tom didn't understand.
That's what Tom says.
You don't have the right to kill your life.
It was a good day.
She put her head on my chest.
We got it.
They gave me the cook.
He's going to Paris tomorrow.
Don't say anything.
You're a lawyer.
They got together.
Take a sip of the paper.
Who's sure?
We're not going.
I'm looking for Tom.
Are you taking Tom's interest?
You've taken care of it.
I'm coming.
Don't forget to take the camera with you.
I was shocked.
Take care of yourself.
I've got a clutch.
I think I've got my job.
I bet I can handle Tom.
I'm a girl.
It was easy.
In the middle of a bunch of fools, love has become more bitter than ever.
Tom's uncle.
You can go.
You're in the lego.
Tom's in our office.
We live on Earth.
It's a tree.
I need you.
You're not in a state where Tom would have killed himself, are you?
Death was a blow to him.
She's busy, she's not talking to you.
No way.
He loves it.
I'm just lucky.
I can see, they're a small part of the family, but, love, they're from everything.
The tiger licked it.
Tom missed the bus.
Tom hates Mary.
Tom said it wasn't him.
She did it to us.
Tom's got it, he's got it.
I'm glad you were.
Eat some pie.
The kids are in the bar.
Grab him.
Gold's got a lot more power.
I took my chances.
Tom's on the phone.
I am.
She took him to the hospital.
Tom often goes to a nick.
Tom didn't talk about it?
Tom said how did he do it?
That's a good idea.
He was a kid.
Ljubljana is capital city.
It's not like that.
Tom's got a piece of pie made by Mary.
Tom's in charge.
Give me the number next to the elevator.
Tom didn't understand.
What are you studying?
Tom's like a white crow.
He'd take you.
Tom's in the middle of a lot of trouble.
Don't give him anything.
Mary was in the car, and I got her.
I didn't do it.
Tom said he didn't have a office.
Tom told Mary that she wouldn't do what she asked him to do.
I won't hurt you.
Tom and Mary are talking about celebrities.
What's wrong with you?
Tom asked Mary to see me.
You didn't do it.
I'll give her a bouquet of roses as a sign for her.
Who's under the number?
She said she didn't freeze.
He cut the tree down with an ax.
How come you don't do it like that?
On the road, I bought a house from my grandfather.
Squash the chicken before you do it.
I'm eating a meal.
I'm glad you did, too.
What are you doing back at the office?
Tom's in the upper room.
It doesn't matter whether you are or not.
She was something.
What do you think it's a fake?
The meat is not in the cold weather.
I don't know what Tom is.
I asked him for help.
Tom didn't.
I know something's wrong, but I'm not sure I am.
He's in the back.
Tom said I was tired.
Tom doesn't appreciate what I told him about Mary.
I don't really tell you what I'm doing.
What do you love more than anything else?
Tom's with me.
Two to San Diego, please.
I've done it.
I did.
My mother's sister is my aunt.
Tom Mike.
It's my favorite.
He saved his life.
I'm going to find a way to get Tom.
I know that Tom is agitated.
I don't know why you do that.
Tom didn't get into the old box.
We make grapes, corn, and fruit.
I had a son.
I'm a savior.
Tom gave us a lot of money.
This is where I met Tom.
If I were six years old, I could.
Tom took care of it.
Tom's all right.
The beach was crowded.
I don't know.
I want to see you in Paris.
What's in Tom's room?
Peace, brother.
I told Tom you were going to Australia.
I'm here for you.
Tom couldn't make it.
Why did you lie to me?
Tom's in the car.
I love sundowns.
Tom's got a dog.
I'll take you.
How's Tom doing?
I'm waiting for you in my hospital.
She doesn't want you.
We've had enough complaints.
Is Tom not in Boston?
Divide it yourself.
He broke the paper in half.
I'm not telling you.
The field has already been planted.
Tom's not there, he's not there.
Tom from home for Mary.
She's not a mother anymore.
I found him.
He believed me.
Tom says he's here.
I'd like the same thing.
You're after Tom, aren't you?
We can't just make a species that we don't.
Who wrote that letter?
You can't take me!
That's good for me.
We've already done that.
It's because of you, I'm out of here.
I don't want you to go, find a self-help shop.
I don't need you anymore.
That's a lot of stuff.
Tom didn't have any idea what to do.
Jenny, give me a cup of tea.
Tom's something that Mary's not.
Couldn't you give me a bank?
Please select the password above the password.
Mrs. Felycier is a Roman Pole.
Tom says he's already driving.
Come on, Tom!
Tom was shot.
I saw him, and I was a student.
They don't admit to being wrong.
Who did you tell?
How did you get Tom to sing?
Would you be able to kill someone?
I'm not going home.
This morning, I'm straightening out.
He's on the first day of the number.
Tom's good.
Long styles.
Don't let him drive you to the hospital.
I'm on my way!
"You don't want me to smoke?" "No, no."
Tom didn't tell me anything.
Oak is a tree.
Eat something, man.
I love how you feel about it.
Tom's father was a girlfriend.
I've seen you before.
Tom was writing about Mary's relationship.
I thought I could help him.
I'm not ready for that.
You need to talk to us.
Are you going to prison?
My sister is often in charge.
Tom's got a job in Las Vegas.
The canoe's overturned.
You were a soldier?
That's a good idea.
Are you a computer?
What would you do, if tomorrow was the end of the siege?
I asked Tom to come with me.
We hurt him.
I don't think Tom can do it alone.
I didn't.
I'm sorry, he wasn't involved in a scam.
Thomas was killed by a molester.
We don't believe Tom and Mary.
I want to do it.
You're going to fight.
We've already done that.
What pair of socks did you buy?
We're not doing anything.
What's with the book that I put in here?
Not to mention the price, it didn't mean anything to me.
I want to know who started it.
I didn't think I'd be ordered.
Write it down with a pencil.
We didn't kill him.
You'd have helped him.
Is that okay?
Tomorrow morning we're talking about going to a Shakira concert.
I've had a lot of fun.
I know Tom's a brave man.
I'm early.
It's not a bug.
I don't want to scare you.
Tom told me Mary wouldn't want to leave.
Have you talked to the ladies yet?
I haven't seen anything.
Mary, you're an artist.
I knew he was right.
Everything's done.
They got lost in the hospital.
What have you eaten before?
I've got a hard time.
Father doesn't take me in alone.
I've been drowning.
I've been home all day.
I'll back you up.
Tom and I didn't go.
They're very hard.
It's not about the kids.
Who are you guys?
My husband's in charge.
He drinks wine.
Jenny, cut off the apple pie.
Tom didn't think so.
You've done it.
You'll make it, you'll make it.
There was no problem with Tom.
It's not dark.
I took him to the hospital.
I'm sure it'll be easy to find a place.
I took two aspirin pills from my headache.
You're in.
He ripped me off to the bottom of a penny.
Don't laugh!
It's not like that.
You're going to Tom, and you're going to find him an intruder.
I took you to the park with Tom.
I didn't want to take them.
I'll find them.
My bike's on the way.
Tom's got a selfie without a shirt.
In whose kingdom was it?
Soon we'll put you in the hospital.
I told you.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sure Tom would be happy.
It's Joanna.
I've done so much.
How can people do it?
So I'm sorry.
I've got my glasses.
Rainwater flows through the pipe.
I took Tom as my friend.
I'm one of those guys who's more friends with kids.
I have insurance.
Tom will be with me.
It's hard for me to drive.
That's not what you're doing.
He's been in the middle of it.
Mary tried to lock up the car.
I am.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom started coming.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
Tom's got a TV.
Who is he?
Tom and John are at the same office.
I didn't want to swim.
He's been drinking beer.
It's harder for our man to be alone.
I'm not going to be with him anymore.
Shh, you'll wake Tom!
I'll keep my handkerchiefs up.
I have done what I have done for them.
I'm a teacher.
They're all there.
She took herself and yelled at me.
Did you take care of it?
The bunnies are nice.
She won't let him.
I'm on my way.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you want a bowler?
I don't want to hurt my wife.
Do you have something to tell me?
Tom was so angry.
You'll be welcome.
What are you gonna tell him?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell the burning respiration?
That's not it.
Is your father going home?
I did.
Tom took the book.
I'm sorry.
I'm the only one who's in the shower.
Tom's got a car.
She didn't buy a cake.
Tom and Mary aren't in the hospital.
Tom got away.
You're obviously tired.
We're in trouble.
Tom's gonna die.
Tom said it was me.
Tom asked Mary to bring a salad.
It's sweaty.
I'm buying a soft toilet.
I've seen Tom the other night.
Tom sat down on the floor with Mary.
Do you know how much that weighs?
Flightman - Squad.
Tom's married to Mary?
All the cans in the park.
Someone has to tell her that.
I've had a lot of time.
Vermont's on the road.
He's staying with his brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You're gonna fix it, aren't you?
I don't like hunting.
He's got a brother in there.
The dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We're coming.
Tom told Mary she didn't get up.
Come on, come on.
I know you don't get it.
I'll send them to you.
I've got my glasses.
I've already been with this student.
Is that a sign for acidic acid?
We've got a lot of stuff.
It's like putting a needle in a haystack.
I went to Tom's.
So I'll talk to the lawyer.
I think you've got it.
Cool!
You didn't tell them?
Tom was dressed like a janitor.
I respect him, although I don't agree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the city.
Who sent you?
She gave him a job.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to go to Boston with me.
Tom wanted to, Mary knew.
Do you think it's cheaper?
You didn't get it.
Put him on the ground.
I wish I could talk to her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
Don't you tell them?
Are you all right with us?
Don't go to school.
We didn't have an appointment.
You got a plan?
We ate in a hurry, and at the same time we did.
There's a garden behind the house.
You're crazy.
Come on, don't drop yourself on your feet.
Take food from the soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you call him?
He didn't drive the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The calf was real.
I brought wine.
I'm not popular.
It's his day at school.
I want to be with you to death.
She also did.
He told me he wasn't sure.
What am I gonna introduce you to?
They're gone.
Apples are full.
You didn't know Tom was in Boston?
I don't want to, Tom's going to talk about it.
Is she singing?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom's been listening.
I think they did.
Are you Tom?
Let's get on the car.
You're interrupting me.
She was wondering if his lips would taste.
A good coach is training the team.
The tree's gone.
The train was locked up because of a strong force.
Why don't you give it to her?
What do you think I don't want to do?
You've got it and you've got it.
That was my plan.
Have you seen her this time?
I told him what I was doing.
I am the United States of America.
He hates himself.
Are you writing this book?
It's you.
Mary's in my hospital.
Is that water?
She's not like that.
Are you in there?
What would you do?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't tell you whether Tom was there or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't in his room to come to his day of detention.
I thought Tom would be in me.
Tom's wearing a car.
She was riding a bicycle this year.
Help us.
You don't need me.
It was winter. It wasn't you taking it.
As I go on the road, I'm a friend.
Do you have houses on the road?
Ivory tusks made of ivory
I'm not leaving.
"What is it, Mike?" "I'm Tom."
I'm sorry.
That coat's not the same.
She's staying for a smoke.
Tom was married.
I bought a book.
His naivety is his best.
My Hobbies are a Collegiate Office.
Tom lived in Boston as a child.
I didn't eat six.
Do you want me to tell them about it?
She's been quiet all day.
No matter what he says, don't believe him.
I'll move on.
Tom and Mary, they're going to be a boy.
Mary's nice, and she's got a girl.
I won't let her go.
In all cultures, youngsters are clapped under a cradle.
It's a restaurant that I know.
You could have taken them out, you could've taken them out.
What was I doing in that place?
I'm sorry to bring you in.
The one who hasn't left his office is a prisoner.
It's so quiet, it's so quiet.
Tom's got his wife.
He's in her hospital.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many, cows are priests.
I've turned on the equipment.
I thought we'd done it.
My mother was opposed to being alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't see you that way.
You're what you're doing, aren't you?
Engine traffic.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're marrying.
In the river.
He was like a miracle.
She and I are the same age.
Tom said I'd talk to you.
Have you already had symptoms?
It's a lot of work.
Did they say you were here?
Could you please?
That's what I'm doing.
I didn't go to school.
I needed them.
He's older than I am.
Tom's the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one who was the one
It's soft.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Don't hurt Tom.
My mother's gone home.
I have a brother.
I didn't tell Tom what he wanted.
He's injured.
Tom said he didn't get into it.
Ours is smooth.
It's that I'm going to France, I just don't know.
It was noon.
Tom did it.
I'm going to Boston in Paris.
I know Tom's wife.
I've been with your men.
Tom Mike.
It's not raining.
I didn't have that kind of experience.
I don't think Tom's staying.
I got a phone call.
I don't believe that.
Step aside from the road to the right.
We're being asked to report.
I'd like you to meet me.
I don't like it.
She's a mother, but I don't like her.
You're under control, sir.
Tom told Mary she was losing her money.
Are you still with this guy?
I didn't take her.
It's not as relaxing as a hot bath.
I don't have that much.
How can I do my job?
There's a book on it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of a voice like a melody of sirens for me.
What's up with you?
I thought Tom found out.
Who called me?
Do you want America's favorite beer?
Tom knew it wasn't Mary.
I've been on the glass.
Chemistry is science.
I don't think I'm doing it.
How can I get a passport?
You're in with Tom.
Tom is the drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They've taken care of it.
Tom hasn't been on Mary all day.
Tom's got fat.
Tom doesn't want a house, but he doesn't have a house.
Outside.
I gave you a dictionary.
It's a car, but it's about to take place.
What are you talking about?
I'd have had it, I'd have it.
You got Tom?
Thomas?
That's what you've been doing.
It's noisy.
I have a stomach.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom said he was busy.
I can't trust anyone.
She's a fan of Sex in the City.
You were impatient.
You said I did.
Take it easy with him.
Tom wants my car tomorrow.
Do you often find that?
Mary told me about the plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake!
It's not like having a beer a day.
What was that?
Tom got his bag.
That's what I'm doing.
Did you get it?
Let's take a breath.
Are you wearing your shoes?
You can leave, please.
Did you read the book that you asked for?
That's what my mom said.
She's making makeup, she's got a dog.
He didn't hurt me.
Smoking is strictly forbidden.
The peaches are beautiful.
Can you see?
Tom doesn't like it.
You don't want to go to a hospital like this.
It's a job!
That's what you often said.
Here are the letters written for you.
It's inconvenient that a scientist of this kind would be a federal authority.
He doesn't have a name.
You're coming.
He was a good swimmer. He was a good swimmer.
I'm writing to a buddy.
He's pretty good at it.
She took the students to the hospital.
She said she was Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And did you tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I've made a jar to the top.
It's straight.
I'm tired, I'm worried about it.
Do you live in this house?
I told them it's the same thing.
What are we living for?
Will it be a day?
We're talking about her.
You could have been ours.
I don't drive often.
That's why you're not a kid.
Just get inside.
Just ask him for a favor.
I got them.
Tom had a job.
You're the one who did it.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love being in the office.
Tom's in the hospital.
You were in the hospital?
You didn't.
I don't know who it was.
You didn't hurt us, did you?
Sorry, I didn't know.
You didn't sing with us?
Are you happy?
I'm sorry to forgive Tom.
I'm on my own.
There'll be a crash tomorrow.
We're going to move it to 11:00.
She said she did.
You've been golfing the first time?
Are we there?
I don't know Tom's name.
We have the same dentist.
Not a Brazilian carnival.
I don't think Tom's doing it.
To whom did Tom sell his car?
Tom's cheating.
I want to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at them.
I don't know them.
If you could have genes for her, would you?
That's why we have to go with Mary.
He's gone to bed.
Everything could have gone wrong and gone wrong.
Tom's got his part.
Tom didn't say Mary's keys.
Did you read the book?
I don't sleep much.
You're gonna get in there.
Tom's good with Mary.
"You're mine." "No, you're not."
He went under and got on his knees.
You didn't get it, you didn't get it.
I'm sorry about that.
Tom, is this for you?
I don't think Tom loves Mary, that I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom is three times more than Mary.
I've been drinking milk.
We'll have a ride tomorrow.
Isn't it amazing?
It gets to cooking, it doesn't compare to Mary.
You're not yourself.
Tom's leg at the shark's rescue.
I'll taste it for you.
We're going to do it as it happens.
I'll be three times the age of you in this year.
Can you tell me what happened?
Give me your stamp call.
It's worth it.
Tom's not much Mary.
I don't think he did.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
Did you know who this was?
She's got to stick to her skin.
I'm in you.
It's winter soon.
I think I've got Tom.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom didn't take it from him.
Tom and I are together.
I'm fine.
Tom's on the phone.
Now I'm married.
That was the first time.
This time you've gone a long way.
That's true.
Are you going to see Tom in front of the hospital?
Tom.
We've got an apartment in town.
They spoke English.
It's expensive.
He doesn't sing anymore.
I didn't know I was here.
They haven't woken up yet.
Tom for a couple of inches, Mary.
I'm glad you did.
It's hard for you to do it.
You didn't tell her?
It's the Greek language.
Sounds simple.
Did I get you?
I just told Tom, he's got Mary in the hospital.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston, was he?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's working.
Why would Tom need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
It's too bad.
I'm going to have a bite.
Tom wanted to buy a new one.
I just wanted to tell you.
It's stuck.
I'm not going to let you take me.
Don't give it to him.
Run or they'll kill you.
Mary said she was tired.
Tom put himself on the line of meditation this morning.
Are you mad at your race?
He's going to make a short statement.
Without books, like a body without a soul.
What the hell are we doing?
What's your brother doing?
We have a volunteer.
Tom is so sure it's not?
I haven't seen you in ages.
I visited Tony.
It's easy to take.
You've already done it.
Aristotle is the center of the earth.
I wonder what Tom's up to.
I didn't.
There's so much on the table, I can't refresh them.
They all turned around and attacked us.
Let me in.
White bears are in the Arctic.
I told you that I'm the whole thing.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask for anything.
Let the dishes be washed by the one who loses in the breeze of paper!
I'm not lucky!
I wouldn't do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He speaks fluently -- at least as he told me.
Tom is a classmate.
Will you stay for a while?
I'm not a girl.
She's got a husband.
The train was on its way.
Home.
I think I'm coming from a beer bar.
Are you Boston?
The orchestra started.
Mary was wearing a suit.
That's not my wife.
You didn't talk about it?
Tom didn't want to be a snitch.
He was in the morning at six in the morning, 5.7 1970.
I'm afraid your plan isn't going to happen.
Jane and Kate are delinquents.
Tom eats his own clothes.
That's what helped.
We have three rules.
She bought one for herself.
You didn't have Tom.
There's Tom's flat.
I helped carry those bags.
They've got a lot of money.
Five times five, five times five.
I live in this village.
I don't want to know anymore.
You don't know what he's gonna say.
My hands are tired.
I lied to my wife.
Jenny, she did it.
It's an ugly thing that's not immune to the fire.
We've got a lot of stuff.
The bill of exchange was split into two pieces.
What are you gonna tell him?
Tom didn't want to talk about him.
Oh, you're so bored!
Reading a book is like reading a book.
Tom saw Mary go into the store.
Aren't you there?
Tom said that Mary, of course, is a killer.
A Japanese man wouldn't do that.
I don't like Boston that much.
She writes letters.
I don't know who I'm with.
Turn left to the front.
Tom took it from me.
That's more than that.
Give me one, girl.
I can't stand being disobedient.
Tom bought it for me.
That's what you said.
You're too small for her.
I've been in school for eight years.
It's about her talents.
If I had, it would have been me.
I'm saying you're not doing this.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
Bob's going to be a part of the festival.
You're in the hospital.
I've been cutting seeds all day.
The accent made me realize that he was American.
That's a problem.
Was that the case?
I'm sorry!
Tom's on his feet.
All the people are talking about it.
I live for myself.
Did you ride a car?
The Duke has many lands.
Well, it was fun.
He told me I was.
My dad recovered.
You make yourself at home.
It's not good!
He did what he didn't do.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Jacksonstein?" "Ametic political scientist."
Get out of here!
What's this, I'm wondering, is this not selling goods at home, so, uh, is this a way to get acquainted with the MRI?
Tom has a coin.
You didn't get the job?
There's no God, you'll be safe.
We're Mary's name.
I knew I needed to take care of him.
Are you on duty?
What's the matter?
Don't take it for granted.
You've done it.
They've been doing a lot.
Don't laugh at them.
Jenny, put your belts on the train and the landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've done it.
I'm sorry.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I've got a lot on my hands, and that's not true.
It hasn't changed.
Did you do this on your own?
I've been waiting for you.
Is that how you feel?
He's got it.
The woods of the house are easy to use.
Let's get Tom ready.
The dog's alive.
I go to school.
I know you lied.
Sleeping in the hospital.
I'll talk about the report tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a slut.
I want to take your side.
I got him coming.
We said something we could do.
Tom is not Mary.
I need it like this.
I've got an appointment.
Our name is José.
You've got it.
We weren't allowed to do that.
What do you want me to do?
Tom's got it without it.
Everything's gone.
She said I did it.
Who did it?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants it.
I'm ready to get ready for dinner.
Mary was in the hospital.
The bird doesn't fly?
It's going to end.
Tom didn't.
Tom died at the age of 17.
It's a gift.
Tom speaks English.
The experiment of a transistor has marked a period of time.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you find out what she said about Alexei?
You look like a girl.
Here we go.
What's on Channel 10?
I'm taking spinach.
She's taking a lunch.
Tom is a pilgrim.
How can I do that?
Your son is good.
I know you've seen it.
I know Canadians.
He's motivated by the will of the people.
We're shocked to hear about his death.
You're not coming?
I didn't see you.
You're just obvious.
He had cancer.
You're the one who's making it happen.
It's as accurate as anything.
I know where you're going.
You're making it fly.
Let's move him.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Tom is more than he tells us.
Tell me you're wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like that.
The janitor broke up.
There's a cat on it.
I don't want to take a job.
You don't chrome anymore.
Tom was a tough smoker.
Tom's wearing it.
It's hard to deal with Tom.
I've been in prison.
Tom didn't want me to.
Tom said he'd be in bed.
Tom didn't get used to this weather.
I'm wondering who gave him a squirrel?
I still don't know why Tom's doing this.
Are you in your souls?
What's that noise?
You've got a lot of money.
It's Michael.
Is that a place?
I'll call you back.
He's down.
I don't know if there's a chance to marry a dog.
The best is the best.
That's what she did.
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I thought it would be easier.
We can do something for you?
Is that clear?
I took five avocados.
Japo is on rice and rice.
Are you ready to go?
Rusty took a computer from Magdeburg, Germany, in the first year.
How's it going?
I can't tell you what I'm doing.
What did you guys do?
Why didn't you go?
We went back through Boston.
Who's coming?
Thank you for that.
Are you crazy?
It's been a long time.
Did Tom take a big scarf?
They're pretty good.
Tom's squeezing his pencil.
Tom didn't ride a bike.
I don't speak to a caluga.
Is that why Tom did it?
You wanted to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild animals.
Did you get it?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent 500 dollars in one day.
Tell them to go home.
Just put it down.
They didn't go to prison.
That's right.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who said that to Tom.
Tom's up, he's up.
The dinosaurs died long ago.
I'm climbing the steps in one.
Tom's got that year.
I've been looking for you.
Tom's a good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, aren't you?
Put it on my desk.
Tom's out of the water.
I was proud of it.
You've done it.
Do you know Brother Tom?
All lizards can do it.
You'll pay for what you're doing.
I've got my hands full.
I ask them to stay away.
Tom learned how to drive.
I'm glad he didn't.
Neither Tom nor Mary did.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen was a knife. I've had a knife. I've had a knife.
Honey, I can do it.
You're about to go to my home.
Keep the bucket and the water close.
You're not here anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're dead.
I can't go in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
There's a river.
Thank you for everything.
I've told you that a hundred times.
I'm cold.
You're told to tell Tom.
They're gone.
Tom and Mary are on the move.
On the other hand, there's a problem in the Norwegian Parliament.
What are you doing with the prepared rice?
It's been ten years since I died.
Tom went out with Mary a year ago.
Did you still have it?
We've run away.
It's a book I've seen.
Tom and Mary had lessons before the meeting.
I don't want to buy your tea.
You're so romantic.
The wife is not a shoe; she is not a shoe.
I'll pick you up at six.
I'm bringing Tom to the church.
I love teaching kids.
Mary's got a carnivore.
I'd like to know how Tom had to go to Paris.
You didn't know I couldn't do it?
What are you doing?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I got some fruit.
Tom's gone.
He's a salesman.
You're always talking to her, aren't you?
"Do you think he's coming?" "I hope he's not."
Tom doesn't think Mary's doing anything.
I'm taking hospital food.
I ate caviar.
They hit me.
She's the psychologist of the husband's psychology.
We've checked.
Tom gave the gun to Mary.
He couldn't do it.
They got on the bus.
Let's go to Mom's.
Who the fuck is this?
Here you are.
He won't take himself.
I used to smell.
Tom didn't want to. He knew someone.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you to come over.
I've been holding back.
Our friendship remained strong.
You're gonna go with him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get to it.
Tom's on the steps.
What does Tom want?
The mollusk puts you in one room.
I'm not bragging.
Take it later.
Tom Mary didn't find her unlocked.
Tom will blame Mary for John's death.
It's up to you.
Are you all right?
We've cut down the trees, we've cut them down, and we've killed them, and we've killed them.
I'm glad I know you all over the place.
I don't want Tom to write any more.
Rabbits breed.
I don't want that.
Are you wearing a coat-cleaning?
We'll paint it.
It's a hole.
I'm not afraid to stay in the hospital.
You're the one who's knocking.
You've got it.
I wish you knew how much you knew to me.
Mary's a teacher.
Give it to me.
I'll come to whatever it is.
You don't want one cup of coffee, you want it?
I'd like to go back to the hospital through Honolulu.
You don't tell me anything like that, I wouldn't know.
I couldn't do it.
Tom's gone.
Tom's talking about it.
Did you talk to Tom about it?
You took them.
She's on her way.
We don't think much about Tom.
How was your day?
It's not about a dog.
Now I am.
Give me a hand.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You can't see Tom.
I'm the one who told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are fruit.
Couldn't you have seen it?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
We can do that.
The trees made me feel better.
He's a laborer.
I slept on my belly.
Keep me safe.
You're entitled to your decision.
Mary told me she'd buy it.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two stamps for forty-five cents, okay?
I'll give you a bicycle for the day.
Tom started to think something was wrong.
Beer.
I don't think Tom is doing this.
I thought he was.
I've got you here.
I wish you had talked to him.
You said it was yours.
Tom's busy.
I'm on that cat.
I'll do it once.
It's interesting.
Don't stay late.
That's what we're working on.
Are you all having fun?
Tom's on a roller coast.
We'll go to the hospital.
It's Tom who told Mary, how's that?
It's amazing, isn't it?
I've got my face.
School's been walking for five minutes.
Tom put a spoon in his pocket.
Is that what's bothering you?
Did you have a rose?
Mary's got a lot of eyes.
Self-confidence is the key.
I just want a good job.
I'll send you a message.
I lived in France three years ago.
Have you heard about it?
I'm squeezing.
We didn't go to Paris.
The volunteers?
I told her I didn't.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
People often regret the weather.
I just want to know if you're doing it.
I knew something was wrong.
Tom swallowed a beer.
I'll tell you what I'm doing.
The family in France, the French.
I'm not used to it.
It's from her.
Do you have a house?
Don't feed the ducks.
Hey, it's me.
Now, tell me something about yourself.
Tom was in the hospital.
I'm studying.
Tom didn't make it to Mary.
Tom's teaching me how to do it.
Tom says he hasn't eaten for three days.
It doesn't look like Tom was having fun.
There's a lot of bumps in here.
I should've told Tom he was going through it.
We'll do it.
I know you're in Tom's house.
Dick handed it over to me.
You said you told her.
Did you think Tom would tell you the truth?
I couldn't put it in her face.
That could have happened.
Someone sent us a picture.
Tom and I have been married for three years.
She's staying with Tom, right?
Are you like Tom dancing?
Tom asked me.
Tom started.
Put on a muzzle.
He wouldn't have killed me.
She wasn't sick.
I'm so sweet.
He missed me, didn't kill me.
Would I have changed my mind?
Tom's in charge.
Did you buy them?
Tom just went to Mary and took it.
I gave them an old coat.
Tom's on Mary's side.
You're either a resident or a conservative?
We're definitely not doing that.
There's someone here.
I'll take myself from Layla's computer.
There was a hospital in Boston.
I just don't agree with you.
You can rely on the new president, can't you?
I'd like some coffee, and you'll take it.
I'd like you to know how much I'm doing.
Did you take the doughnuts?
Venice is a city.
You need to talk to Tom.
That's a real name.
In the end, she never did.
Dr. Harris: He was on duty.
What's your business?
That's what I'm doing in the first place.
Come on, take it.
Tom's a risky place.
Tom's got a lot of money, but he's got very little money.
I went to the museum the other day.
I didn't do it.
Do you know him?
I'd like to talk to the foreman.
He won't let me, but he did.
I took care of it.
I'm on an hourly train.
I can't get you into my life.
I've taken her.
Did you tell Tom?
Tom and Mary are good for each other.
You bought a expensive coat.
Scholars tell you that.
What are you doing?
Do the Germans have any need in their lives?
Does she have a gun or a stew?
Hey, what are you doing?
They're talking about it.
Potatoes are cheap.
Why?
This is my project.
We don't have water.
Wouldn't you?
Even if I drink, it's not about how I drive.
Tom told me I was home.
I lived in a living room in Boston.
Don't look at it.
There's a bus stop.
So it's definitely more than that.
Tom's got his eye on him.
"Oh, I'm dying," said Billet, kneeling.
The way I got in the car, I told you I was home.
Did Tom die after a while?
Are you on the phone?
We don't know what we're doing.
We've got it under control.
Who's there?
What's your day of salary?
That's obviously true.
You did it, not me.
I'm sorry.
We'll take it tomorrow.
Shut up, you talk a lot.
Don't trust him.
Are you running the system?
I swore I didn't do that.
Tom's got a dark spot.
Tom and Mary are good.
I'm afraid I can be treated.
Are you an actor or a singer?
I've had enough of that.
Tom, it's not locked.
Tom was swimming with polymantines.
It's a standing place.
I know Tom's a good teacher.
How rude of you!
You said I did it.
Dan knew he was in love with Linda.
I saw Mary leave the house.
Couldn't you come out of here?
Tom's dead.
He's a friend of mine, not mine.
Tom told me he didn't want to move to Australia.
Tom, that's not going to happen.
I'm telling Tom that we're doing it.
I'm so glad.
I need breastfeed.
Pizza is an insult.
Are you a dog?
Tom said he wasn't mad at Mary.
Did I?
I'd like Tom to win.
We're not doing anything.
I couldn't do it for Tom.
I don't think I'd do that.
The kids don't want to fight.
I thought Tom hated Mary.
I'm a student.
You've got it.
Well, I think it's time to go.
I haven't been singing in years.
Tom is no longer with Mary.
Tom gave me a tie.
Why would Tom tell you about his life?
Come in half three, please.
I've got a lot of things that you're not, I won.
I know you're not here.
I went to the shoe store.
We've found him.
Tom didn't know Mary was in Boston.
Are they with you?
Don't write beauty with ink.
Tom wasn't yelling at me.
I don't want to take you out.
Keep your hands on the wheel.
He'll be in tomorrow.
I've seen your license.
I didn't.
I'm quiet.
And that's till morning.
I've got a lot of stuff.
That's his letter.
People without a job are like a meadow without a job.
Thomas's on the map.
I've been hanging out with dogs in the middle of the day.
I didn't want Tom.
Tom, I'll tell you what's going to happen.
I told him I changed my mind.
It's because of the deception that the subject is more than the first.
Do you think I'm a girl?
They didn't talk about it.
Tom and Mary are in the hospital.
I thought you were asleep.
We have a little surprise for you.
He's proud of his children.
He ate sausage.
Tom said Mary was crying.
Tom took Mary, but she didn't go to his shop.
You're not with Tom's brother?
I don't have any.
It was a strange story.
Do you have our address?
Tom's home.
He's coming.
Is that a name?
Tom's gonna stay.
Do you want me to go to the bar?
I've been doing more than that.
I did it.
Get out of here!
Emily asked me.
I wanted to give you this.
The masquerade is from 10 pm.
It's not as hard as you do.
Shakespeare, a peace officer, lived a hundred or so years ago.
I don't want you to put me naked.
Tom told me he was cold.
I don't blame you in any way.
Tom saw everything he had.
How did you get to that kind of thing?
Who do you know in Boston?
I did, because we're not going to have a job until the end of the day.
I think you're welcome to me.
Hi, I'm Sepide.
I did, Tom Walt.
I wish you'd come with us.
Tom gave me a ride.
We can't do it any more.
People are on ants.
I have a plan.
Half the city.
I was so excited.
I haven't seen them yet.
We have schools.
I thought Tom was your husband.
I know you're Tom.
I like walking alone.
Tom didn't want to be ignorant.
I'm here to help you.
She wanted to be with you.
You give me a Canadian.
I'm tired, I'm going straight down.
I wanted to tell him something, but I didn't.
It's been a problem.
We'll talk for dinner.
Do I have a problem with that?
It's theirs.
She's weak.
You've got it.
Tomoko didn't cry.
I'm taking you as a gift, as a gift, as a gift.
Ubuntu has a lot of possibilities.
He said I did.
Do we have Tom on the scene?
Did Tom sleep?
It's the theory and the idea.
I know you don't recognize them.
She likes bathing with rose petals.
He's her teacher.
He's at his desk.
Put him on the table.
Am I right?
I'm in the port.
We're drinking vine-banana juice.
I want to talk to you about Tom.
The bridge is six months away.
Tom thought you were busy.
I can't smell my mouth.
I'll find a way to do that.
The value of what it is is minimal.
We took her to work.
Your skin is whiter than your skin.
Tom was on his way back.
I'm going to sleep.
I saw Tom do it.
I'm the only one who can't handle it.
You've got it.
Tom wouldn't know what you're doing with him.
Tom's not late.
Let me get you something cold to drink.
Is it true that you like sweet coffee?
I didn't think Tom would want it.
You've given it to me, you've got to hold it back.
I'm sure you won't hurt me.
Children smoke.
You'll start.
Fathers over there.
It makes me so angry!
I don't want to, you're mad.
I couldn't do it.
What's with the stamps?
I've done my best.
Everything's gone.
I love football.
They're not talking about it.
I've got the structure of the Ainu.
Or you'll die!
You're wrong.
There's no more than a man.
Tom often sneezes.
What are we doing?
I love kids.
I got him.
I can't take the guitar.
You could ask her.
I'm on my feet.
I thought Tom wasn't here.
Do you like it?
I don't take her.
Who fell?
You should have put me in the hospital.
Do you mind if I take a look?
We've got a name.
That's why we got Mary.
I don't have anything to do with it.
You're three centimeters ahead of me.
Tom said that to me.
I love almonds, but no peanuts.
I'll keep an eye on it.
Did you know you had a gun?
Is that what you're telling Tom?
Tom told me I didn't say I did.
Just take care of us.
She said she'd try.
She's dyed it in the hospital.
There's been a lot of trouble.
Tom's not smart.
She loved him all the time.
Even if I knew it, I'd know it.
I almost lost weight.
He brought me back to the hospital.
I want you to know that Tom's fine.
Take it to her, she was in the middle of it.
They snuck in and killed Tom.
It's for you.
Tom didn't take Mary.
She likes her life.
There's a fire in Citatheater.
I turned right.
Tom got rid of the cats.
Why don't you take him?
He didn't have the manner to say it.
My idea was great.
I don't know if she'll cheat.
Mary is one of the most beautiful men I've ever met.
I go to school with Tom.
The operation lasted six hours.
Are you okay?
I'm a freak.
Tom said yes.
Is it yours or mine?
Do you have the lights?
I think I appreciate it.
They did it.
I don't like it, they touch me.
Do we have olive butter?
Don't let Tom beat Mary.
I have two men and a brother.
Take us there, Tom.
They're gonna get married.
Swimming with dolphins.
I'm sure Tom won't win.
I was very sad when Tom died.
You don't have to go in there, you don't have to.
Whose wine is this?
Are you home?
I'd like you.
Hey, wait a minute.
If Tom asked me, I'd help him.
You'll do whatever you want.
Tom coughed.
Are you talking about Tom or yourself?
How did you get here?
You lied to him!
I don't think there's anybody else who's done it.
I'd like to go to Boston.
I think Tom is.
Tom got here.
I've got a job with myself.
I'd love to have them.
Mary said she had Tom.
We'll be on our way.
Tom went to Australia.
I love vanilla.
I don't know the meaning of the word "findre".
You could say the least.
She was very young.
All of them are amazed that she tried to get pregnant when she was 48 years old.
Cosmetics is a gun therapy.
I can't lend you that.
I've been in America two times.
You can go home.
Tom's not the one who wants to.
Mary's got her hair in her.
Let's not talk about that.
It's not good, it's good.
I'll work tomorrow.
Did he stop looking at me?
To the point that Mary wants him.
He took care of himself.
Can we speak the same language?
I took Tom's nose.
Don't look at him.
I've been there.
Cut your legs with a knife.
I know what they're doing.
Mary likes to go to prison.
Mary wanted Tom.
It's a practice.
There'll be a problem.
I've got my handkerchief.
Have you ever been around with Tom?
Tom was proud.
He's already gone to lunch.
That's not true.
Tell them what you're doing.
That's Tom's sister in the bikini.
What do you mean about me?
Tom didn't let Mary become president of the government.
Find good friends and hold them.
Tomorrow he'll run with a kid in weight.
It's easy.
That's why they said he's the guy.
I wanted to be like you.
I got up this morning.
I don't think Tom needs help.
What was the problem?
We can go to dinner early.
I was sure Tom didn't.
I don't have much time.
We're in Kiev.
Give it to me, you're back.
I got her.
Is that hard?
She said she was Mary.
I'm leaving Boston.
"Keep it like this." "Yes?" "No, that's it."
What's wrong with you?
She's sorry.
I'll go.
I don't want to be here.
It's 1080p.
I didn't know you were that bad.
You could be a lawyer.
Monkeys are bananas.
You shouldn't have done your old car.
He's going to catch up.
They're going home.
I'm glad you did.
What are you talking about?
Did you catch up with him?
You've got a nice girl.
It's a partial device.
I knew Tom would say no to this.
I'm sorry.
He's like I told him.
That's what I'm doing.
In our days, I don't feel like a ghost anymore.
There's something I need to talk to you about.
It's not my fault.
Tell him you're the same.
If we don't work, we'll lose the contract.
A drunk man couldn't go straight.
Mary's not my wife.
You're a friend.
We're on our way.
I don't know, Tom didn't win.
That black bag is yours?
You're here.
There's an old-fashioned place in this town.
Mary's mad at you, isn't she?
What's the course?
Tom was neatly dressed.
I'm a democracy.
He's like she's riding a car, until she's got a point in it.
He's coming in with her.
You'll have to keep it in the hospital.
One of Jupiter's moons, Hanimed, is more than Mercury's planet.
Prisztina is the capital of Kosova.
Tom was so calm.
He's been in an accident.
We've got Tom.
I helped her wash the dishes.
Keep your hands down.
You're going to lock up.
I told him to go to the hospital.
The Grad's been hit.
What's the matter?
Jim Jim?
He's got me on it.
What wine did you drink?
I don't like Tom looking at you.
I got Tom.
We can find a way to find a place to go.
There's a voice in the throat.
They found his book.
It's raining.
I'd like you tomorrow.
He went home to work.
I see a place far away.
We're waiting to leave.
Tom gave me all his money.
I can't do what I can't do.
My sister doesn't study.
I know who I am. I know who I am.
Are you alone?
It was, it was.
I was in charge.
Wouldn't you?
Tom returned Mary's keys.
They're on their way.
Put your seat belts on.
Do you have a child in your room?
Tom doesn't panic.
You can have tags.
We're in the middle of it.
I won't.
I think it's time to go.
We found it this morning.
He didn't take her.
Ciao, this book is all sold out.
I didn't know you were in trouble.
My granddaughter yells loudly.
Tom would like to have a list.
I'm insecure.
A few miles of tunnels to England and France.
You're not with him?
Dan's in his room with Linda.
She forgave him for killing her.
He's gone. He's gone.
Tom's been singing all day.
I've been talking to you.
I'd like a beer.
How did you park the car?
I don't know her.
I'll be home by the time I get there.
What did I do to her?
John's a boy.
They can save you.
We're just guys?
People who are autistic don't get into the country.
Have you called Tom yet?
Tom says it's going to be French three hours a day.
Your name is in the hospital.
Who's your father?
We made you a pie.
I'll pick you up.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Come on, come on!
It's a slut soccer game. Men are in the rugs.
Do you have a pen?
A Persian cat slept under the table.
I lent him my pencil.
I didn't know you guys were that bad.
You're not interested in what Tom is doing.
Try not to get lost.
What are you talking about?
It's hot here.
I'll take care of it.
I told you we were coming.
He couldn't get my address.
You're gonna hurt Mary, you're not gonna hurt her.
Did I tell you, you know?
The police ordered her.
Tom's three years back.
I'm not doing it.
He cries because he's hungry now.
I don't know how to do it, but obviously it was.
He's over the top.
I'll take a walk before I do.
I'll do it my way.
I've got to talk to them.
I'm not telling Tom.
In 1961, Nikolai Khnapov spent seven years on the psalm “Christ’s Law to You, ” becoming the capital of the German Baptist of Youth.
I thought Boston didn't take you.
Let me get them.
That's why I went in there.
I don't know, he's got my phone.
He went to the store.
I'm going to get Tom.
I took breakfast.
It's a lot of stuff.
What are you doing?
You're welcome.
"I'd like to take three of them." "All right," said a woman, "but remember that everyone doesn't work well.
Tom won't be here.
You don't have any.
Are you awake?
I went to talk to you.
I'll be in the kitchen.
Mary took off her glasses.
I'd like to take Tom.
They've been working.
Tom wanted to talk.
Will you buy it?
We don't know where we are.
There were no chairs in the room.
We rented an apartment.
I don't want to talk about it directly.
That's right.
Put them in.
Bob didn't take a ride, and he took a cab.
She'll love it.
You're the teacher.
You didn't, did you?
On the way, I took Tom.
What's their plan?
Tom, alone and abandoned, standing on the left of the edge of the country, couldn't go down, with the rest of the country.
Did Tom help you?
The Dutch language is the German language.
How's the factory going?
Did you call Tom?
I thought Tom didn't have a car.
Prostitution, gambling, prostitution, prostitution, the establishment of the established order, and all the regulations of the institution are outlawed.
Tom didn't make that comment.
You don't want me to take charge?
How's your name written?
It's shining.
Two hours.
I'll fix it later.
I'm glad you're welcome.
Is there something I can do for you?
What a fool!
That's where I come from.
I just need Tom's support.
Moscow is a city.
Don't cross the road to the light.
Why did you do that?
My mother gave me a ride.
While I'm writing the manuscript.
The table's full.
I didn't know it was illegal.
You've done it.
I thought Tom was married.
Tom bought a lot of stuff.
It's okay.
Jim's all right.
Everyone laughed at you.
Do you have a restaurant in Boston?
I'm guessing because of something, I'm gonna get used to it.
You ordered the order.
Did you do it?
Tom has a penis.
What you're doing is how you're doing it.
The victory was the first of Tom's company.
I'll take it inside.
Goodbye.
The door is unlocked.
I'm in pain.
He won her bondage.
You took care of it.
Tom's got a lot of stuff.
Where are you going?
We'll talk about it.
Here's my experience.
You told me Tom was coming to you.
Tom was on the bench smoking a cigarette.
Tom, you're going to die.
I wonder what that is.
I don't know how old I am.
Tom's late for work.
Tom's gone.
We're almost late for the ride.
Looks like something's coming up.
Watching it like a girl.
"Are you straight or gay?" "I'm straight."
I'm sure you won't.
Tom's fine.
Two years ago, I didn't go to basketball.
You've done it.

Tom's a surprise to me.
Sharks can take blood in the water.
I want to be with you.
Do you recognize this?
I'm sorry I went to Boston.
Pour a sponge in the water.
I'm sorry, darling.
Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom will be fired.
Don't!
I hate you guys.
We need to tell Tom what we're talking about.
All the gold sheds are gone.
Tom's got a job.
I knew Tom would want to go.
We're gonna get dressed.
I didn't know you said that.
Do you have ghosts?
Tom went to the diary.
Take mine.
That's a good idea.
Clean it up.
I want to be paid.
Tom's gone.
Tom was attacked.
Mary's on the move.
All I have to do is drink vodka and sleep.
Two plus two is equal to nine.
Tom was puzzled and confused.
That's it, man.
I was afraid she wasn't home.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't have done anything.
I can't do it, just like I'm asking you.
Don't let Tom know about this.
You've got to get in there.
That's what I'm talking about.
All locked up?
I believe in God.
Are you all right?
Do I go to the zoo tomorrow?
I know you're in.
We'll go talk to them.
Street, I'm going to the hotel, narrow.
Hong Kong Hong Kong has seven and seven.
He's got a lot of money.

I can't do more than that.
It's all right.
We took Tom home.
You can pour wine in a glass.
Ask Tom if he's coming.
You're with Tom, aren't you?
He's gone.
Tom, is it from me?
Tom's got a lot, but he's got a lot.
He was old, he'd be dead.
His brother was in high school.
She's rich, but she's rich.
I agreed with Tom's staff.
I'm a rag.
I have a dog.
I put my coat on inside.
She took it from him.
Tom's in the hospital.
Are you in America?
Do you have a lot about us?
Don't you tell me?
He's the one I love.
- No, I don't know.
Get me out of Paris.
You've got a way.
You were lying in the hole.
I know my brother very well.
A poet with her in the hospital.
We've got them.
Can I ask you to help me?
I'll tell you a secret.
They both lived in Boston.
I'm sorry I didn't do it.
I should've been in front of Tom.
I've already talked about Tom.
Astella and I are going for a walk.
I want to be on a car just like you are.
I didn't know you were here.
They can't do everything.
He's in France.
I don't care.
Tom doesn't drive a bus.
Say hello to me.
Tom said Mary wanted to.
Masha puts it out, and Thomas puts it out.
I wanted to buy a blue car, not a red car.
The day will come when we take a trip to the moon.
I'm not ready to give up.
You're on your way.
I'm not doing this anymore.
I don't see you either.
I don't know, Tom.
Come on, come on.
I want to give Tom something for the day.
Take him away.
I said, "It's not interesting."
Mary laughed.
I like Harry, not as much as Draco, of course, but I think he's cool.
You're tough.
Tom was wearing gloves.
We need your help.
Clean hands save life.
It's true.
You need water.
We got passersby.
We never found out who it was.
Did you see them with you?
I'm so happy to have you.
I laughed.
A bottle of bottles.
You want Tom?
Now I know why Tom hates me.
That's why I'm sick.
It's been a little hard on you.
That's what it means.
On that day, there were hundreds of people.
It's a job, man.
I've got a lot of Tom's.
Freedom is useless, she won't get it.
A cooked meal and a chicken flavored with spices were served on the table.
You want me to stay in Boston?
We don't want you.
I climbed Mount Fuji three times.
I don't have pants.
You didn't take him.
You want to talk to Bill?
I took the bus.
Tell me what that means.
Tom walks around with his glasses.
Tom's in custody, Mary.
She's a woolen woman.
I don't know what Tom is.
I'll do it.
Silver isn't as expensive as gold.
I've been years old.
Stop talking about them.
Your mother.
Tom got you.
This isn't me.
Crack got used to it.
Tom did it, too.
It's a lot of work.
You've been with Tom.
It's a problem.
It's wildly cold.
I want him to respect me.
That's what I've been doing.
They called them Tom.
Tom didn't tell me about you.
He became intoxicated and chattered.
Tom and Mary, that's what we're talking about.
Who are you?
Oh, my God, what have you done?
I got you.
How do you cope with the cold?
He said he'd go there tomorrow.
Tom didn't eat anything.
We've got her.
She spoke to me on the phone, just show up.

Could you give me a camera cheaper than that?
I can't tell my husband.
You'll be famous.
Smoking?
How'd you do?
Tom went home.
I made him do that.
Tom wants to know about Mary's ice cream.
Your eyes are slippery.
How's it going?
I didn't tell Tom that I didn't have any money for this.
Ask who you want.
PowerPoint, what do you think I'm doing?
Tom and I are in Australia.
You didn't know it was?
You're taking the FBI.
Tom told you?
You're a swimmer than Tom.

I don't know if you're doing this.
It's one of Tom's favorite books.
You're from Boston, too?
Tom's got it secretly.
The barn was broken.
Tom and I are good friends.
It's 10 o'clock.
I'd appreciate Tom's carving, but I'd be able to run with him.
She was a girl there.
I'll be there in an hour.
How were they killed?
I took my shoes off and you put them in the hospital.
Tom's in business.
She gave him a day's work.
You're lucky you've got a job.
I'm with my kid.
The old man is alone.
I'm on my own.
I'll tell myself.
She gave it to him.
Did you go to Tom's concert?
I fed them.
A long time ago, the king of Israel lived.
You're doing this, you're not an archaeologist.
Take care.
Tom told me it was a book.
Don't worry.
Honey, I'm sorry, I'm gonna be late.
What did he get his ID?
I've got a lot of books.
Oh, we've got sugar.
Tom's on the move.
Are you looking for him?
You're dead.
I'll tell them to contact you.
Did you say "good day" that day?
I used to live on the Park House.
Is Tom really in Boston?
Are you still out?
We're about to call you.
He didn't go into it.
Come on, finish your breakfast.
I'll take him to the hospital.
What does he want, do I get it?
He's proud.
You knew him better than I did.
Tom didn't read the deal as much as he would have.
Tom didn't do it.
We're going to bed tonight.
Tom just wants a picture.
I'm going to let them do it.
I can't act like a box.
Luke says he likes to swim.
The teacher told us the words.
He's not strong enough.
He's on his own.
Are you not home?
Tom punched his fist in the hospital.
Tom, Mary's gonna be here.
Weigh the peaches, please.
Are you Chinese?
Is it true that your Japanese friend's name is Dad?
We've written a lot of books about it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sixteen years old.
She touched her hand.
I took your name, but I didn't say your name.
He told me he wasn't cold.
I'll take Tom to kindergarten tomorrow.
Did you get it?
She's got a lot of eyes on her.
Who was hurt?
Tell her you're welcome.
She's taking care of her life.
I'm not really good at shit.
There is.
You're tough.
He's taking his place in France.
Tom and Mary are here.
Tom is Mary's grandson.
There's a dog!
The widow is a widow, the husband is dead.
How's the river coming?
I want my desk back.
He's offended.
That's all I ask.
You don't even know!
There's bloodglasses on the wall.
And it's a collage.
I don't think it'll be easy for you to do that.
You're going to Vietnam.
I'm a better man than I am.
I didn't suspect it.
I sat down with them.
I'm worried about that.
Go find Tom.
You're gonna bring me in?
I've had a few minutes.
I love you, and I want to take you.
I'll find a job to fit in.
I can't stand you.
Tom's medicine in Boston.
Did you not know that Tom lived in Mexico?
How do I feel about my husband being mean to me?
I'm not in charge.
I just can't take care of it.
And Tom?
Esperanto, Ido, Interciliv, Clingo, Lopbane, Navi, and Vladak, the Company.
It's a lot of it, it's a lot of it. It's a lot of it.
Give him what you know.
Tom's a depraved man.
Tom's here.
Mary, I'm coming.
He's good.
How are you, how old am I?
The first one on the road dies.
We gave up.
Tom thought you were drunk.
It's bigger.
You know, I've got to go with Tom.
How are you doing?
Tom almost fell off his bike.
I'm still here.
Tom's a doctor.
What did you want, you mean?
Tell him what you're doing.
I didn't understand you.
I don't get any of them.
We got you?
What are you doing? Are we doing this?
I have one book.
I'm still going.
I'm surprised you weren't invited.
I'd like to clean it up.
I don't know any of the five ladies.
I took my umbrella out of fear.
Immediate volunteers.
I have a cough.
Tom's a good boy.
I'm convinced we can do this.
That makes me feel bad.
I've got something for you.
Tom walks about five miles a day.
Both Tom and Mary, who's doing this.
Tom Mary, she sold her painting.
I'm glad you did.
Here's my phone.
Are you bringing me something?
Is Tom going to the hospital?
You won't love me the way I love you.
There's something I need to tell you.
There's a lot of water in the water.
One of the two got to Tom.
Can I put my shirt on a smaller one?
They're on a trip with the towers.
You should have taken him alone.
I didn't know dogs were doing it.
Tom knew where he was.
I was just doing it.
It's, uh, it's a girl.
I don't have a pillow.
There's plenty of cream in the fridge.
She's not a little girl.
Can't you talk to me?
Tom spilled his coffee.
But how can they do that?
Mary says she didn't do it.
I don't tell them.
Is he in there?
You're out of date.
You didn't?
Don't tell your friend.
I made Tom swim.
Tom and Mary are on the move.
I wanted to, Tom.
I took all the personnel and took Tom to the office.
Tom saw Mary just once.
If you live to be my age, you'll know what I mean.
Tom handed me the package.
Did Tom want that?
She's on her way, but she's on her way.
We've got a ball for Mary until she fixes it.
What's your mom?
I'd like to convince Tom to confirm that.
How did you put them together?
Tom doesn't want to, because someone knew he was going to Boston.
Tom said he was eating.
I've never seen them before.
That's why the spleen spleen is on the table.
Are you washing your hands?
Vengeance is the pain.
They did.
What about UNESCO?
Tom said he wasn't hurt any more.
I can't bend my right hand.
Bring us some food.
Cats are like cats. It's okay with you, but you try to talk to them yourself, you don't mind.
What do you know about Tom who doesn't know me?
Are you an ambassador?
Tom's got us doing this.
Did you buy those towels?
I'm sorry tom once.
That would have worked.
I'd like to go to a house for the kids.
I'm Boston.
All of our efforts have failed.
Both Tom and his wife are in Boston.
Tom and Mary are not married.
That's what I'm telling you.
We're both good.
You didn't tell me that?
I miss him.
He told me he'd try.
I'm coming and following her.
I'm ready for that.
I've got to hurry, I've got to get out of here.
Her husband is rich.
You love my sister.
What's for work?
It's for you.
Tom was defeated.
I don't think I'm going to be with Tom.
Did you have a good time?
I haven't been misled.
Can we make ourselves a car?
Tom didn't even have an umbrella.
Africa is far away.
I'm just saying.
We're all with Tom.
I'd like to stay with them.
I've got it.
I wanted to, Tom, Mary was.
It's got to be a habit.
I wanted to take him.
Tom didn't go to school anymore.
I'm your maid.
He loves going to the theater.
That cockroaches thing?
I didn't know you were.
You're more of me than I am.
They're going to make a lot of bitterness.
Do you have a minute to talk about Jesus?
Five minutes, man.
What do you mean you don't know me?
We've got peace right in here.
You have a house.
Put food on it.
Do I speak the same language?
Which one did you buy?
She's Brazilian.
Tom's not kidding.
I killed my daughter.
You bought the bread.
It's worth the crop.
You haven't finished yet?
We're going to spend some time in a quiet place.
That's the truth.
I was a girl.
Tom disappointed Mary.
We're outnumbered.
We didn't want to defame our leaders.
I've been in prison.
Tom could have given you a favor.
Grow up a little.
You're just not beautiful?
Tom will try to talk Mary out of it.
I took the train.
Tom's got you.
That's why I don't know what Mary says.
It's unnatural.
You didn't tell me what you were doing.
Ask your questions.
Mary was there.
Strictly speaking, a tomato is not a vegetable, it's a fruit.
Algeria has taken its stand.
I don't think Tom's in love with me.
Tom cleans the kitchen and cleans the living room.
Tomorrow's the day!
How do you know you'd take a shot at my house?
I went like you.
I don't want to go with you.
Italy is often praised for the flutter of spelling, and the words are written in the language of the church, not in the case of it.
I live in Lahore.
Don't leave me.
Did you buy this for them?
It's a big deal.
Just don't blame Tom.
Did you get the keys?
I'll stay with Tom.
What did you want to talk about?
Did you tell her?
He's got his hands on his hands.
How do you cook your men?
He's got his mind on it.
Don't you know what you should have told me?
I'm sure Tom will kill you.
No fucking jokes!
I'm not in the house, I'm the one who's done that.
Tom admired Mary.
Tom bought Mary's money.
I know you helped him.
I know it's hard.
I'm going back, but I can't get used to it.
Tom told me we had a problem.
We need to plant more.
Tom left Mary.
I think I could do that.
The protest.
Tom ended up out of Boston.
The boy was shy, and he didn't speak.
Hey, get off the bike.
That's a good idea.
Did you not know that Tom lived in Boston?
Mary said she was tired.
Who's going to pick up the faggot?
Tom's coming for us.
It's a lot of fun, you seashells on the beach.
She's heartless.
Tom has a house in Boston.
What are you buying?
Tom ate for breakfast the corn boy.
I knew his name.
Tom wanted to.
Tell her she's home.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I just want to talk to you.
Tom overturned his drink.
The swimmer was drunk and drowned.
You're better than Tom.
You're afraid it's locked on the key?
The older he gets, the more he's got the strength.
Take her in, girl.
I'm the one who put you in it.
Mouses will drink the water.
That's all I'm asking.
You're not too tense.
Which one of you speaks English?
"Tom me Mary?" "Are you not Mary?" "No, I'm Mary."
Tom deserves it.
My mother was convinced that a guest greedily eats a pie.
There's nothing to do with it.
Journey off the rails.
I won't get used to it.
Are you doing this?
They would've been in May.
We're organized by a police department.
What you said killed her.
Why don't you come with us?
Would you have taken Tom?
What's up with you?
Mary went to the dolls.
Tom didn't want to, Mary told Jon.
No, it's so important to you.
We knew you didn't kill him.
He's gone.
We'll figure out what we're doing.
Tom didn't say anything.
He's got an apartment.
Advertising.
People kill people.
Didn't I tell you not to put me in Tom?
You've done it.
Can you do that?
Little girl?
Let's go to bed.
That's what I said.
Blue is my name.
Did you buy it?
I didn't have the power of math.
You don't eat bananas?
You mean the teacher?
I don't think Tom's coming.
I didn't know Mary was in it.
London is the capital of the United States.
Is the truth standing on one leg?

That's why it was hot.
He's been on the street.
Tom missed his wife.
It didn't happen.
It's 100 meters away.
Tom wants him.
Is that fair?
I want to go, I want to go, I want to go, I don't want to go, I want to go.
I've been wearing a lot of clothes.
Now, watchmen, you can't stand me, I'm four!
Why are you crying?
You've got to go to Tom, you have to ask him yourself.
Mary knew she wasn't needed anymore.
I wanted a discount.
Even Tom couldn't do it.
We have our rights.
Science is on the table.
It made her feel good.
Tom, Mary, John, and Eve are all gone.
We can't take Tom.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I've known him for ten years.
Promise me no more!
Let's just make it simple once.
It won't be as hard as you do.
What are you gonna tell me?
I went to Boston.
So I'd be lying in bed.
Tell her you're not ready.
I went to the house.
I used to do butter.
Tom couldn't have done it without you.
Tom went to Mary's room.
Would you like a little?
What's she drinking?
She's got him.
I'm sorry.
I don't have a student who has a dictionary.
Are you on the press?
It's an experience.
Tom's gone.
I know who helped Tom.
It's the same way as America.
Why do you want us?
Philosophy is often referred to as the vocabulary.
I have no secrets from you.
The police got to the police.
Tom is older than Masha.
Are you wearing your handkerchief all the time?
Is she funny?
Did you send Tom to teach him lessons?
I still don't think it's true.
How far is Toshima's mayor?
She yelled at him.
He's got a role in it.
I appreciate the way you sing.
You're killing me.
How do you do that?
I don't think you've got the same thing I've got.
It's a bad time.
I'm going to work.
I've got something for you.
Who pays?
My number is 9-876-54-32.
Tom's on your way.
He's gone.
Tom, you're an eloquent speaker.
I got in touch with Tom.
It's been snowing all night.
Give me a hand.
It wasn't there, it wasn't Tom.
I read it.
Where do I get this?
Anyone who could afford it, that's all.
I won't tell Tom you said that.
Tom saw the room.
She wasn't so scared in her life.
You're not fair.
Don't let me go home, man!
I know Tom seems like a brother.
Tom, it's me.
I didn't know.
I'd like some hot chocolate.
Tom doesn't want to live on his salary because he's got a lot of money.
He's not a swindler.
They got him.
I don't know if I can park a car.
What are you gonna do?
She's pretty cute.
I won't move out until you get back.
Let me thank you for doing this.
Tom's behind them.
Tom, do you want to find her?
I'll call him tomorrow.
Take Tom away.
She did it.
I don't want you, you were.
I want Tom to take them.
Tom's good with Mary.
I'm not.
I can't let her.
Did you tell them?
I'm safe now.
Tom can't help it.
You went to a concert tonight?
Tom's out of the shower.
My brother's coming.
Tom took Mary.
Don't hurt me.
What are you doing?
You deserve it.
We can't keep going, we can't keep going.
They went to the island.
They're not what they are.
Tom got me.
What are you doing?
Tom wants a house.
How would you answer that?
How busy were you?
I've never seen you before.
Everybody laughed at him.
I don't like it without gas.
You didn't want to tell me. You should have told me.
I sent her a note.
Tom's gone far away.
That's a lot of stuff, isn't it?
Hey, I got Tom.
Don't be unreasonable.
Did you think I'd reset it?
Tom is such a gondon.
You planted pumpkins this year?
Tom was calling Mary's.
I knew you wouldn't be there.
What are you doing?
Tom's still in Mary's?
He's got a jealous wife.
I'm sorry.
Your house is three times more than mine.
Try not to get used to it.
I'm going to have to show up.
Tom's a very generous man.
It's soot, and it's not too bad.
We were early.
Tom was a kid, and he loved climbing.
Tom said he saw someone invisible.
I thought we'd be in the hospital.
I can't deal with that Tom.
Don't tell Tom I'm doing this.
I just need some information.
The flood's gone a lot.
You'll be with Tom and Mary.
Tom?
Let's do this for Tom.
Tom's for going to his room and opening.
The ambulance arrived.
The game was put to the end of the game.
I'm going to send Tom to see if he did what he did to my brother.
I don't know any of his men.
Bring her something to drink.
My wife was on the bus.
I thought you'd check it out.
I did it for Tom.
Should I take Tom?
We have three dogs and a cat.
I didn't know you didn't.
Are you coming?
I'm innocent.
We're in the middle of it.
Anyway, we're talking about it.
Do you have a supermarket?
You're lying to me.
Tom could have told Mary the truth, but he didn't.
Ask a stupid man, and he's a stupid man.
Which one of you should I have?
My wife's in prison.
You know Tom's wife.
She's your aunt, isn't she?
What are you doing?
She'll grow up.
I thought you should go.
Who are they with?
Tom says he's right.
Could you give me that?
Don't waste your talents.
Let's do this for Tom.
Are you going to Tom?
He'd have been looking for her sometimes.
Everything you do is right.
Did you ever think I was having my ninth day?
Want a calculator?
A day without you is like a summer without a family.
You don't have a girlfriend.
I know you're right.
Take Tom with you.
Maybe you'll learn to swim.
I'm sorry.
I want to know what you're doing.
Is she okay?
The sky is clear.
You didn't tell me how you were being sent.
I'm taking you to the hospital?
I'm not going to take you to my favorite restaurant.
They did it.
I went like sweat on my forehead.
Tom renovated us all.
Tom's gone.
I repaired the car.
Tom didn't come out of here.
You'll sing a song.
I'll try to do it.
Did I say something stupid?
Could you give me some help?
I know his address, but it's a secret.
Let's go.
I'm tired, man.
I don't care if she does.
She could have done that.
She speaks the sixth language.
Stay on the road.
You're coming soon.
I know someone needs this.
I slept well.
The actress fainted right in the play.
Do you have a dictionary?
I knew Tom wouldn't win.
Tell him I'm busy.
Stay home.
I can't work without you.
Let's do this with Tom.
She reported to the boss.
I've been doing sports all day.
I'm not the one who has your secret.
I haven't seen anything that looks like it.
I want some gloves.
The caterpillar is in the butterfly.
You're so bad!
It's kind of like that.
I went to his place, as he said.
I'm sorry.
I, the clericalist, was king of Paris.
You should have told me.
Tom was out with the dog this morning.
Let's go to bed.
If I were a bird, I'd be here for you.
I took your letter in the box.
Is there a zoo next to your house?
We're on the rudder of resistance.
I've taken care of it.
It's from a single match, it's a fire, or, once it's a fire, it's going to get a carton?
I knew I was doing this.
The problem is, there's not a lot of water.
They're saying that the product for the skin has dried up the wrinkles.
The truck hit the truck and the traffic light.
Tom, his passport's been lost.
You're the one who blamed it.
What's the matter?
We all agree.
I love peaches.
My wife.
Tom's wearing it.
You seem to have misunderstood.
I didn't have the keys.
Daniel looks like Uighur.
She'll probably go to the park tomorrow.
Tom's in love with Mary's friend.
I have a finger on my right leg.
He's not doing it yet.
Did you find that?
Are you kissing me?
I'll prove you're wrong.
The corona virus is in the country.
He didn't say that, but he was.
Joe doesn't want to take you, so I don't want to take you either.
Tom's home from Boston to the hospital.
That's my dog.
It's been a long time since the heat was so hot.
I'll try to take care of Tom.
I don't have a brother, but I have two cases.
We're going to get to a place where it's dark.
Don't go home until you've done your job.
Tom helped Mary with the job.
You're here.
Are you fair?
Tom said he had it on his cell phone.
There's no way to go.
I'm going to have to sit down with you for a second.
I thought it would make her happy.
Tom from the coma.
What are you talking about?
I'll bring Thomas.
I don't want to do it, but you don't want to do it.
Did you find that?
I have something for Tom.
I knew you were making a breeze.
Don't go for a walk.
His character's up.
You need to know what you saw.
I got Tom.
He gave up blood.
It's expensive.
I came, I'm sorry.
He was proud.
Tom and Mary would be a couple.
We've found it.
That was a good idea.
Tom saw Mary.
Tom checked the list.
I don't have any.
Don't say anything.
I wrote a letter from a friend.
I don't like it, I'm a fool.
Tom's head is tied.
It's easy to roll.
Tom said he was skeptical.
No matter what he's talking about, he's saying he's talking about everything.
I have to tell Tom.
They didn't know it.
Tom's on me.
Was that you?
Tom's happy.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
I'm afraid Tom won't make it up to you.
Tom's been beaten, he's a friend, he's been beaten.
Because of the man in the hospital.
Ouch...
Someone's working.
I want to see you.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
How did you do it?
I didn't tell Tom.
We all do.
I'd love a cup of tea.
You're gonna put yourself on her bed!
I know you don't get any more.
That book was a sticker.
What happened with Tom's car?
I think you're good.
Don't touch my book with your hands.
What a bastard!
Why did you sell your house?
I'm an elephant against the wall.
She doesn't speak English, she speaks English.
Thank you for helping us.
I'm not going to talk to Tom.
I bought it on a loan.
I almost died.
God gave, God took.
John doesn't hurt me.
In the meadow.
Wake up and be safe!
There was a stranger talking to me on the bus.
Bob and I are.
We're on the road.
I was an acetic.
Did you get it?
I got him.
I've got a lot of things to do.
Mary hates Tom.
I took it from him.
I can't speak.
I'm sorry to cross the street!
I'm sorry, but you could have taken it.
The bride is an American of Polish law.
Someone's hurting me.
Did you get the sandwiches?
Ghana and China are both men.
Are you afraid of dogs?
Did you cry?
Tom won't buy a bottle.
She's not my mom, she's my mom.
This book is popular with students.
I told Tom you were hungry.
I love everything that's happened to me in summer.
I'm waiting for you to get ready.
The sine and the cosine of the sine are negative 1 and negative 1.
I won't let you go.
The police have killed someone.
The child is not a vessel, but a fire, and he will drive.
My day is the year you've been on.
Tom's got a rifle and a knife.
You won't forget them.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
I knew you'd follow me.
I couldn't find his house.
I'm thinking about going to Australia.
Someone's coming.
He's been staying in the hospital for a while.
I've had this cookie for them.
You're perverting my words.
Let's go back to your lesson.
Tom didn't come home often.
You're acting like you're home.
I'm waiting all the time.
Soup tastes good, doesn't it?
I've got a lot of people.
There's a boxer in the fridge.
I still can't believe Tom hates Mary.
Tom didn't say it was coming.
You're worried about Tom.
Can you take this for me?
I can't do much for you.
I came because I was asked to come.
Just before we got there, there was a man who took himself.
He's sitting on his feet.
I cried out.
There's a lot of people in Asacus.
I wrote it for Tom.
You're not married?
Tom, he was a drunk.
Tom told you where you were going?
He's not richer than I am.
I wish I could have told you!
She's late for her flight.
I'm going to the sea in the summer, and in the winter I'm going to the countryside.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
You know all about me.
The old man is going to the hospital.
You're stupid.
He's not mad.
You're a little tense.
Not like that.
What would make you happy?
I'll come to Paris, Tom to Paris, and Mary to France.
Do you have any kids?
What's the Empire State Building?
Hey, how are you?
Neither Tom nor Mary's legal.
Kzeli, it's true.
Can we lock it up?
I don't know what to say.
What are you guys doing?
We've got a robbery.
Keep Tom out of trouble.
I didn't go to school.
You go with me.
Tom drank red wine, and Mary drank red wine.
I've read the books.
It's good for them.
He doesn't want me.
It's the city's edge.
Are you out of your mind?
The pigeon kept roaring.
It's my fault.
I don't think there's anyone like Tom Deke.
I'm not going to take my soul.
This isn't my house.
I'd love to.
I'm sorry, you paid a lot for this.
I'll take it.
I wanted some money.
She said she didn't want to go.
You don't have a job.
You're all of us.
I've come.
I've asked my supervisor for a salary.
Did you deliver it?
Could you walk me out?
Mary's hands are on her hands.
Is he wrong?
Tom looks like a girl.
We haven't talked about it.
I know what that means.
I should've done it.
Mary said it was herself.
Don't you know how I'm telling you this?
She's just having fun.
I've spoken to the ladies in English.
It's for robots.
Punctual Tom didn't.
Tom and Mary slept.
They're all fascinated with me there.
Drink it for me!
He's stabbed himself.
Singer moves to a tortoise.
You don't have any.
You're the one to take care of it.
I can't afford to buy a new bicycle, so I can buy that one.
Tom doesn't think there's a life on Mars.
I can't spend all day.
I've become a lawyer, and I've sent people.
I visited Dan.
I went back with him.
He's got it.
She doesn't look more than 60 years old.
Can you take her?
She's a singer.
I've done it a lot of times.
Don't play poker with them.
Tom has something to do with it.
I'll get her.
I want Tom.
Tom gave me Mary's phone number.
Tom held the rope with his hands.
Tom didn't go to Mary's.
Tom's with me.
Don't blame the others.
I thought Tom was coming to see us.
I didn't tell her.
Tom burned the stove.
They took it.
Mary could've done it, I'd have done it.
Tom Mary, where she wants to go.
You want me to be alone?
Did you send Tom to help him with his lessons?
Tom likes oranges.
It's a plan.
We're the ones Tom said yes.
I've been thinking about them all day.
I don't like it, I don't like it.
How's Tom?
Tom's gone.
Tom's in there.
X-rays revealed that they had two companies.
Tom said Mary wants to eat.
That's why I had to get there.
It was a fantastic day.
I said night.
Try to take care of it.
Let's go for a while.
There are laws.
Tom forced Mary to do a lot of work.
Are you... are you talking about Tom?
I did it for you.
We were just talking about you.
Excuse me, may I?
I thought you'd be there.
Mary's wearing two.
If you see Tom, you'll understand.
I want to take them to work.
I'm sure he does.
Did you get me?
Were you born there?
I don't have the right ears anymore.
He said it's nine.
The butterfly was flying.
There's no need for that.
I've got both of your suitcases.
Prices.
She's not wrong.
I'll tell Tom what I'm thinking on this case.
Don't be mad at me.
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
Do you like it?
I love winter.
Show me her.
They took you.
He's been in America.
Tom, of course it's not like that.
He sent me, and I was just going to lie down.
I can do it, so you can.
His skin was warmed.
Tom's coming back.
Tom doesn't want to, I'll go.
