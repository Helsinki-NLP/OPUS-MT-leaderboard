Imagine China / Reuters
TikTok governs the censorship of the dynasty, in Tiananmen, in Tibet, or in the province of Falun Gong, in the province of The Guardian.
In the documents that came to the country, it says that TikTok (ByteDance) with the government's office is responsible for it.
The main part of this is that, you know, it's a "fighting" thing.
TikTok puts discontent into the context, sets out rules, does not censor.
It's a criticism by a socialist who's under the "criticism or assault on governments and rules of law, as the monarchy of the country, as the Parliament's system, etc."
I'm going to take the Tiananmen or I'm going to take the "scan" or other countries.

On the other hand, if TikTok can talk about the state or the state, Bogdanov will say yes and says he's seen it.
With Bogdanichi, Uur Digital Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for TikTok is in Pakistan: the posting shock to content, discrimination against content, and so forth."
But by the rules, you can give the content, you don't allow the monitors, you can give it to Zaripov.
Zaripova is just one TikTok partner.
According to TikTok, his number in the world is 500 million, 40% of the population is 18 years old.
In the country, TikTok can have people over 13 years of age.
