The protest organizers said 100,000 people went to German cities like Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
According to police estimates, there are 6,500 participants in the Berlin protest.
The protests also took place in Paris, Sofia, Bulgaria, Vilnius, Lithuania, Valetti, Malta, Tallinn, Estonia, Edinburgh, and Glasgo, Scotland.
About 200 protesters protested near the offices of the great copyright owners in London.
Last month there were mass protests in Poland when the country signed the TPK, which led the Polish government to decide not to ratify the treaty for the time being.
Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the process of joining TKK.
The animal liberation organization and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (CLSP) are again calling for the mandatory installation of surveillance cameras at all Australian slaughter camps.
New South Wales Chief Inspector David O'Shennessi told APC that watching and checking places of slaughter should become a common practice in Australia.
"The Video Observing System clearly reminds people who work with animals that animal welfare is the highest priority."
According to the International Earthquakes Map of the U.S. Geological Survey, there was no record of earthquakes in Iceland in the previous week.
Icelandâs Meteorological Office also reported no seismic activity in the Heckla area during the last 48 hours.
The significant seismic activity that led to the change in the phase took place on March 10 on the northeast side of the summit of the volcanoâs caldera.
There were dark clouds at the foot of the mountain that were not associated with volcanic activity.
Clouds introduced the probability of confusion as to whether the eruption actually occurred.
The moon had 120 to 160 cubic meters [120 to 160 cubic meters] of fuel on board when it crashed, and strong winds and waves threw it out into the waves.
The helicopter rescued the twelve crew members, and the broken nose was the only damage they got.
The 100 meters was on the way to pick up their standard cargo of fertilizer, and the officials at first feared that the ship could shed the cargo.
The proposed reform has already been adopted by both chambers in 2011.
The change was made by this legislation session when the second sentence was first removed by the House of Representatives and then took a similar form in the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which offers to ban one- sex civil alliances, may theoretically open the door to civilian alliances in the future.
After this process, the joint resolution under the symbol HJR-3 will be reconsidered again by the next elected governing body in 2015 or 2016, as to whether it will remain in force.
Among the achievements of Votoje, besides the industry, you can mention the 1973 hunger strike against what he viewed as political censor.
The French legislation has changed, its activity returned at the age of 15 when it joined the French Opposite Movement during World War II.

Karno is a well-known but controversial English tutor who taught on behalf of Moder Edwards and Kings Glory and claimed that he had 9,000 students in the peak of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents thought were rough, and also, as noted, he used an unnormal vocabulary on the course.
The Modern Education School accused him of posting large advertisements on buses without permission, as well as of lying that he was the main English tutor.
Before that, he had also been accused of violating intellectual rights, but he was not charged.
A former student said he was using the language class, taught him to date on notes, and was just a friend of the students.
During the last three decades, despite China's official status as a Communist state, it has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were led by Dan Xiaoping.
Chinaâs economy has grown 90 times since then.
For the first time in all the time, in the last year, China exported more cars than Germany, and ahead of the United States as the largest market in this industry.
China's GDP could be higher than that of the United States over two decades.
Daniel, the fourth storm in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean.
A storm about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum wind speed of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Center for Hurricanes predict that Daniel will gain hurricane power by Wednesday.
Since the hurricane is far from the land, it is still difficult to estimate its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in the capital of Croatia, in Zambia, Bobek gained his fame by playing for the Belgary Partisan.
He joined them in 1945 and played with them until 1958.
When he was on the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 games.
No one ever went out or scored more heads for a club than Bobeck.
In 1995, he was chosen to be the best player in the history of Partisan.
The celebration began with a special show of the world famous Circus du Solley.
The National Symphony Orchestra of Istanbul, the janich band and the singers Fatich Ercoch and Muslum Gurces followed the example.
Then there came the tremors that were spinning.
The Turkish pop-deep Cezen Axu spoke with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexio.
Finally, the Turkish dance group Anatolia's fires performed a "Troy" dance show.
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old racing driver, died in a car accident on the Indianapolis highway.
While driving a heated circuit, Lentz fell off his motorcycle, and was hit by another racer, Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately examined by state medical authorities and taken to the local hospital, where he later died.
The loan did not suffer during the incident.
As for the financial situation in the world, Zapatero continued, saying, "The financial system is part of the economy, the most important part of it.
We've been experiencing a financial crisis that's been going on for a year and has escalated in the last two months, and I feel that the financial markets are now starting to recover."
Last week, the Nolain News announced that they would greatly increase their demand for news reports in international languages, with three new speakers.
Already broadcasting in English and Japanese, this worldwide organization launches language programs in Spanish, Italian, and Korean for television, the Internet, and mobile devices.
Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a terrible scene where people tried to break windows to get out.
People beat the windows with chairs, but the windows couldn't be broken.
"One window glass finally broke, and they started climbing out through the window," said afflicted Franciszek Kowal.
Stars release light and heat from the energy generated when hydrogen atoms pour (or melt) together and form heavier elements.
Scientists are working on creating a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
Yet the problem is very difficult to solve, and it will take many years before we witness the construction of suitable thermonuclear reactors.
The steel needle is held on the surface of the water because of the surface tension.
The surface tension is caused by the fact that the water molecules on its surface are tied to each other much more strongly than the air molecules above them.
Water molecules form an invisible film on its surface that allows objects like a needle to swim on the surface of the water.
The leso on the modern blanket has double edges, and a conspicuous expanse between them. The two edges provide better contact with the ice even during the slope.
Just as the lower part of the blade is slightly curved when the blade bends one or the other, the edge that has contact with the ice bends.
If the swimmer is tilted to the right, the skater is turned to the right, if the swimmer is tilted to the left, the skater is turned to the left.
To get back to their previous energy level, they have to get rid of the extra energy they received from the light.
They do it by emitting a tiny little bit of light called the photon.
Scientists call this process "sustainable radiation" because atoms are stimulated by bright light, causing photon light to be emitted, and light is a type of radiation.
The next image paints the atoms that emit photons. Of course, photons are much smaller than this picture.
Photons are even smaller than what atoms are made of!
Hundreds of hours later, the light bulb spiral eventually burns out, and the light bulb no longer works.
Then the lamp needs to be replaced, and when the lamp is replaced, you need to be careful.
First, you have to turn off the light device switch or disconnect the cable.
This is caused by the electrical current towards the lamp patron where its metal part is located, which can strike you with the electrical current if you touch the inner part of the cartridge or the metal base of the light bulb when it's still in the patron.
The main organ of the heart vascular system is the heart that pierces blood.
Blood leaves the heart on tubes called arteries, and goes back to the heart on tubes called veins, and the smallest tubes are called capillaries.
The teeth of the triceratops could crush not only the leaves but even the strong branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceraptors ate a sap palm, a plant common in the Craida period.
These plants look like small palm trees with sharp, thorny leaves on top.
Triceratops could use his strong beak to rip leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists suggest that these plants are highly poisonous, so it is unlikely that dinosaurs used them for food, even though even today a sloth and other animals, such as the parrot (a offspring of dinosaurs), use poisonous leaves or fruits in food.
How would Io gravity affect me? If you were standing on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than the Earth.
A man weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io, so gravity certainly attracts you less.
The sun doesn't have cortex like the earth on which you can stand, and it's made up of gases, fire and plasma.
The further away from the center of the sun, the thinner the layer of gas.
The outer part that we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which means "light bullet."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, using a telescope, discovered that Venus, like the moon, had three phases.
The phases are because only the side of Venus (or the moon) is illuminated, returned to the Sun, and the phases of Venus support Copernicus' theory that the planets orbit around the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrox observed Venus passing.
After Daniel's conquest in England, there was lasting peace.
In 991, however, Ethelred encountered a Viking fleet larger than any other in the era of Goothrum centuries earlier.
This fleet led Olaf Truggvason, a Norwegian with ambitions, to free his country from Danish domination.
After initial military failures, Ethelred was able to negotiate with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try with a change of success to subdue his kingdom.
It was invented in 1444 during King Sejong's reign (14184,450).
King Sejong was the fourth King of the Dynasty, Joseon, and is one of the most highly prized.
At first he called the Hangil Junmin Jongeum, which means "the right sounds to control people."
There's a lot of theories about how the Sanscrit came about, one of them is migration of the aria from the west to India, which has brought their language with it.
Sanscrit is an ancient language that can be compared to Latin in Europe.
The oldest of the world's most famous books was written in Sanscrit.
Sanscrit is a very complex and rich language that has become the source of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin was the source of European languages, such as French and Spanish.
When the battle for France ended, Germany began preparations for the conquest of the island of Britain.
Germany called this attack the code name "Operation "The Sea Lion," most of the heavy military and food supplies of the British Army were lost during the evacuation from Dunkerke, so the army was quite weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Krigsmarine") and could have defeated any fleet that might have invaded through the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were located near the likely invading routes, since the Admirals feared that they would be sunk by German air strikes.
Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans, and basically Italy was the "young brother" of Germany and Japan.
She had a weaker army and a weaker fleet, even though she had built four new ships before the war.
To capture these countries, they would need a military base to enable troops to cross the Mediterranean and enter Africa.
To do that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt.
Japan was an island state, like Britain.
Submarines â ships designed to travel underwater and stay there for long periods of time.
Submarines were used during World Wars I and II, and they were very slow and had a very limited range of shooting.
At the beginning of the war, they traveled mainly on the sea surface, but as they began to develop and become more accurate radar, submarines were forced to dive underwater so that they could not be spotted.
German submarines were called U-Boats.
Because the Germans had successfully operated on submarines, after the war, they were not trusted to have them in large quantities.
Pharaoh Tutanhamon, who is sometimes called "Pharaon Tut" or "Pharaoh boy," is one of the most famous pharaohs of ancient Egypt today.
Interestingly, in ancient times it was not considered particularly important, and was not listed in most lists of ancient pharaohs.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous, and although many of the graves of the past were robbed, the tomb remained virtually intact.
Most of the things buried with Tutankhamon were well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
After the invention of the wheels, the Assyrian chariots became easier, faster, and better equipped to overtake soldiers and other chariots.
In about 1000 B.C.E., the Assyrians formed the first cavalry.
The cavalry is a military unit that fights on horses, and the saddle has not been invented until then, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of the horses.
We know a lot of Greek politicians, scientists and artists, probably the most popular person in this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems "Iliad" and "Odysseus."
The dramatists Sophocle and Aristophan are still popular, and their plays are among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is a Pythagorean mathematician, mainly known as his famous theorem about the ratio of sides of the right triangle.
There's different estimates of how many people Hindi speak, and it's between about the second and fourth most widely used languages in the world.
The number of speakers in the language varies depending on whether or not closely related dialects are taken into account.
It is estimated that between 340 million and 500 million are speakers of language, and up to 800 million people can understand it.
Hindi and Urdu languages are similar to the vocabulary, but different in writing; in everyday communication, mediums of both languages usually understand each other.
About the 15th century, northern Estonia was under the great cultural influence of Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the local people, so they invented the Estonian literal language.
It was based on the German alphabet, and one symbol was added.
In time, many words borrowed from the German language began to blend, and that was the beginning of an enlightenment age.
Traditionally, after graduating from school, the heir of the throne immediately joins the army.
Charles, however, entered the University of Trinity in Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology and then history at 2:2 (second grade).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to have a degree.
European Turkey (eastern Thrace or Romania on the Balkans) covers 3 percent of the country.
The area of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) in length and 800 km (500 miles) in width, and has about a rectangle shape.
Turkey, including the lake, has an area of 783,562 square miles (300,948 sq km), of which 755,688 sq km (291,773 sq km) is located in Southeast Asia and 23,764 sq km (9,174 sq km) in Europe.
Turkey is the world's 37th largest, and roughly equals the metropolis of France and Great Britain combined.
On the three sides of Turkey is surrounded by the seas: from the west by the Aegeans, from the north by the Black and from the South by the Mediterranean.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence begins in 1839.
Belgiumâs present territories were formerly part of Luxembourg, but came under Belgiumâs control after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but was occupied by Germany both in World War I and in World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the founders of an organization known today as the European Union.
Printing Dzong -- a destroyed fortress and Buddhist monastery at the top of the Paro area (in the Village of the Foundation).
It is said that in 1649, Jabdrung Ngawang Namgyal built a fortress in honor of his victory over the Tibetan and Mongolian armies.
Because of the fire of 1951, only some of the Relics of Printgel dsongue remained, such as Shabdrung Ngwang Namgyala's images.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining one of the most sensational monuments of Bhutan.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was cramped between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century, the Thais conquered Cambodia several times and in 1772 destroyed Phnom Penh.
In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who have jobs are working in the informal economy.
Two thirds of the working population of Venezuela work in the service sector, almost a quarter work in the industrial sector, agriculture is in the fifth.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil mining, where the country is a clean exporter, although only 1 percent of the population is employed in the oil industry.
At the beginning of the country's independence, knowledge and experience of Singapore's botanical garden helped to transform the island into a tropical garden city.
In 1981, Wanda Miss Joaquim, orchid hybrid, chose to be the national flower of the country.
About 1.5 million grass - eaters travel from northern hills to the southern plains by rain every year about October, crossing the Mara River.
And then they go north through the west, crossing the Mara River again, after rains about April.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro conservation area and the Maswa Reserve in Tanzania, as well as the Masai-Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Training on interactive media content requires common and traditional skills, as well as interactive class techniques (discovering, editing audio and videos, narratives, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to overestimate your ideas about media production and learn to think nonlinear.
Interactive design requires that the components of the project connect together and at the same time make sense as individual units.
The disadvantage of target lenses with variable focal length is that the focus complexity and the number of lenses of the optical system needed to reach a range of focal lengths are much larger than in constant focal length lenses.
This problem gradually disappears because lens manufacturers reach higher standards of production.
This allowed the zoom lenses to create photographs by quality related to the kind that the lenses reach with constant focal distance.
Another disadvantage of the zoom lens is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is generally lower.
That's why inexpensive Varyo lenses are hard to use in conditions of poor light without a flash.
One of the most common problems in converting a film into a DVD format is the frame.
Most TVs are made in a way that pleases the wide audience.
That's why everything you see on TV has circumcised boundaries on top, bottom, and sides.
It's done to make the image cover the entire screen, it's called a splash.
Unfortunately, when you're creating a DVD of the video edge, it's likely that you'll also get cut, and if the video contains subtitles too close to the bottom edge, they won't be fully reflected.
The traditional medieval castle for a long time was an inspiration, bringing into mind the scenes of Arthur's games, banquets, and knights.
Even standing in the midst of thousands of years of ruins, it's easy to imagine the long-forgotten sounds and smells of battles, almost to hear the knocking of a coop on a brick, and to feel the fear that rises with a hole in the dungeon.
But is our imagination based on reality, why were locks built at first, how were they designed and built?
The typical for that period is Kirby Maxlo's castle, rather a fortified building than a real castle.
His large closed windows and thin walls would not have been able to resist a decisive attack for long.
In the 1480 â s, when his construction began by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively calm, and only a small group of nomadic marauders needed protection.
The balance of powers was a system in which European nations tried to uphold the state sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea was that all European nations should make sure that one nation did not become powerful, and so national governments often changed their alliances to keep the balance.
The war for the Spanish inheritance marked the first war, the main issue of which was the ratio of forces.
This marked an important change because the European powers no longer had to wage religious wars, so the Thirty Years â War was the last war, called religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C.E. by the fire of Herostratus.
Ephesian, angry, announced that the name Herosphet would never be written down.
Greek historian Strabon later wrote down the name, so we know it today, and the temple was destroyed on the night Alexander the Great was born.
Later, after Alexanderâs death, the temple was restored in 323 B.C.E.
Relax your hand as much as you can, still pressing the right key, so try not to make too much movement with your fingers.
So you're going to get a lot less tired, remember you don't have to press the keys with great effort to get an extra sound like a piano.
To reach a larger volume, you have to use more pressure or speed flasks.
Mysticism is a quest for a commonality with, an identity from, or a conscious perception of, the highest reality, godliness, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks direct experience, perceptive powers, or understanding of divine reality/godliness or deities.
Followers follow certain life - styles or practices designed to fuel such experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious beliefs and its emphasis on direct personal experience in a unique state of consciousness, especially the experience of a calm, discerning, blessed, or even ecstatic character.
It was founded in the 15th century in the Punjabi region as a result of religious separation from Hindu tradition.
The Sikhs view their faith as a separate religion from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which Punjabi means "the course of the guru," and the guru is a fundamental concept of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has gained special importance, and it forms the basis for Sikh beliefs.
This religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469 - 1539) followed by the next nine gurus.
However, in June 1956, the promises of Khrushchev were put to the test when the riots in Poland, where workers protested food shortages and reduced wages, turned into a general protest against Communism.
Although he sent tanks at the end of Khrushchev to restore order, he met certain economic requirements and agreed to appoint the popular Vladislav Gomuk as the new Prime Minister.
The Indus civilization is the Bronze Age civilization in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, which covered most of modern Pakistan, as well as some areas in the northwest of India and the northeast of Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the Indus basin, where its name comes from.
Although some scientists assume that since civilization also existed in the now dried Saraswati basins, it is right to call it the Hindu-Saraswat civilization, others call it the Harapan civilization, called Harappa, the first place it was found in the 1920s.
The militarism of the Roman Empire contributed to the advancement of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began to hire doctors and even created the first Roman Medical Corps for post-war relief.
Surgeons were known for various soda products, including morphine from macaw seed extracts and scopolamine from grass seed.
They've mastered the amputation perfectly to save patients from gangrene as well as the flags and arterial presses to stop the bleeding.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has made great progress in the field of medicine and has formed a large part of the knowledge we know today.
Simple origami is a technique that allows you to make only one bend at a time.
John Smith designed it in the 1970s to help inexperienced origami or people with limited motor skills.
Children learn about race and racial prejudices early enough, and such racial attitudes influence behavior.
For example, children who view racial minorities, who have theories of poor schooling, tend to learn poorly when they learn about such attitudes.
MySpace is the most popular site in the United States and now has 54 million profiles.
These sites received much attention, especially in the educational system.
There are positive aspects to these websites that include easy configuration of a class page that includes blogs, videos, photos, and other materials.
You can easily access this page by typing only one Internet address, which makes it easy to remember and easily dial students who may have problems using keyboard or spelling.
It can be configured so that it can be readable and can be added as much color as possible.
"It's a neurological disorder, which is a classic triad of symptoms that includes impulsiveness, distraction and hyperactivity or excess energy."
It's not a learning disability, it's a learning disorder; it's "about 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps 2 million American children."
Children with HDLs find it difficult to concentrate on such things as schoolwork, but they can focus on things they like to do like play games, or watch their favorite cartoons, or write sentences without separators.
Such children tend to get in trouble often because they're "involved in risky behavior, fighting, and disobeying the elderly" to make their brain easier because they can't do it in the normal way.
DEAD affects relationships with other peers because other children do not understand why they act or communicate and their maturity varies.
As the ability to learn and learn as mentioned above changed, the basic speed of learning changed.
The approach to receiving information was different, and there was no emphasis on personal reminiscence, but the ability to recall text became more of a focus.
The Renaissance has significantly changed the approach to learning and sharing knowledge.
In contrast with other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move, to weigh, or to rock on trees.
The chimpanzees â arms and legs are similar in size and length, which tells of the use of arms to carry weight while walking on four limbs.
The human hand is shorter than the leg, with more straight phalanxes.
The fossilized bones of two or three million years of hands indicate a functional transition from hand movement to skillful hand control.
Some people feel that the experience of many artificially triggered conscious dreams too often can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that conscious dreams extend the length of time between rapid sleep stages.
With less sleep-in-night, this state in which you're having real sleep and your body is being regenerated, is becoming enough infrequent enough to make it a problem.
It's as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to sleep consciously overnight.
During the week after Italy declared war on June 10, 1940, the 11th U.S. regiment captured Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In ambush east of Bardi, the British captured the chief engineer of the Italian 10th Army, General Lasticci.
On June 28th, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor General of Libya and direct heir of Mussolini, was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruca.
Feds as a modern sport are done at many levels, from university students to professionals, as well as at the Olympic Games.
In this kind of sport, most of the time, they play duel, when one fencer opposes another.
The golf game is a game in which players use keyboards to put ball in holes.
The usual round covers eighteen holes, usually starting from the first hole and ending at the eighteenth hole.
The player who beats or hits the club to finish the course wins.
The grass around the hole is cut shorter and called Green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is that people associate with travel: recreation tourism.
It's when people go to a place that doesn't look like their everyday life to relax and have fun.
Beaches, subject parks, and camping sites are most often the most visited tourists traveling for pleasure.
If the purpose of a visit to a certain location is to familiarize itself with its history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Travelers may visit different prominent places in a particular country, or they may simply focus on only one location.
When the colonists saw these actions, they also caused reinforcements.
Among the troops that reinforced the front positions were the 1st and 3rd NHampshire regiments, which included 200 people under the command of colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later made generals).
Stark's men took positions along the frost of the north side of the colonists' position.
When they poured a hole in the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall in the north direction, ending at the edge of the water on a small beach.
Greedley or Stark put a pillar about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered no one to shoot until regular troops passed it.
The U.S. plan for coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder would have launched a distracting attack on the British garrison in Boardentown to block the way for reinforcements.
General James Ewing intended to cross the Trenton ferry across a river of 700 lodgers, to take the bridge across Assunlink Bay, and not allow the enemy's troops to escape.
The main assault group of 2,400 crossed the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Green, one under Salivan's command, to march in front of dawn.
As we move from a quarter to a half mile, speed starts to play a much smaller role, but endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
Of course, the first-class runner for half a mile -- a man who can run faster than two minutes -- must have sufficient speed, but also need to develop endurance.
The race across the intersected area in winter, combined with upper body training, is the best preparation for the runtime season.
Simply proper diet will not help to achieve good results, but it can have a significant impact on the general well - being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective drinking habits, and understanding various aspects of the use of additives can help athletes to improve their performance and increase their satisfaction with sports.
Middle-distance racing is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions about some of the equipment needed to participate.
If necessary, items of equipment can be purchased, but most of them will either have little or no real impact on the result.
Sportsmen can choose a product, even if it has no real advantages.
Atom may be considered one of the basic ingredients of all matter.
This is a very complex unit, which, according to the simplified Bohr model, is made up of a central nucleus around which electrons orbit, which is somewhat like planets orbiting around the sun -- see Picture 1.1.
The nucleus is made up of two parts -- neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge, and neutrons have no charge.
Before you examine the victim, first make sure it's safe.
When approaching the victim, we need to evaluate the location and identify any disturbing points.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear and cataclysm were mediating between pain and limited potential in people who suffered pain at the bottom of their back.
The effects of catastrophe, rather than depression or fear, depended on regular weekly organized exercise.
Those who engage in regular physical activity need additional support in terms of negative perception of pain, which distinguishes chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical movement.
The vision, or the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the star system or the eyes.
There are many different eye designs that vary in complexity depending on the needs of the body.
The different structures have different features that are sensitive to different wavelengths, have different degrees of sharpness, and require different processing processes to understand the meaning of input information, and different numbers for optimal work.
The population is a population of a particular species within a given area.
When all the individuals in the population have some identical phenotypical trait, they're known as monomorphs.
When individuals display multiple options for a certain quality, they are polymorphic.
The columns of traveling ants move and nest at different times.
During the nomadic period, the breeding ants march at night and stay in the camp during the day.
During this period, the colony builds temporary nests that change every day.
Each of these nomadic riots or marches takes about 17 days.
The word cell comes from the Latin word cella, which means "little room," and for the first time, it was used as a microscopist that studied the construction of cork.
The cell is the primary unit of all living things, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and important to learning life that they are often called the building blocks of life.
The Nerve system supports homeostase by sending nerve impulses through the body to maintain good and safe circulation.
These nerve impulses pass through the body very quickly, which helps protect it from any potential threat.
The tornado hits a small area in comparison with other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
The first two percent of the tornadoes last more than three hours.
The wind speed in these monster hurricanes is 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
People make and use lenses to increase for thousands of years.
But the first real telescopes were created in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes combined two lenses to zoom in and at the same time increase distant objects.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and the nature of cooperation, that, if the majority gain the benefit, there will always be more benefit that can be gained in a short time, acting selfishly.
I hope most people will realize that their best choice in the long run is to work with others.
Many people dream of the day when people will be able to travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people are interested in what is there, some believe that alien planets or other life can exist on another planet.
The stars are so scattered that there are trillions of miles between them that are neighbors.
Maybe one day your great - grandchildren will stand at the top of a foreign world, thinking of their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made up of countless cells, eating food and digesting it in themselves, most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (although not even all animals have; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).
Animals meet all over the planet, they dig holes in the earth, they swim in the oceans, they fly in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of the living organism.
The cell comes from the Latin word cella, which means a small room.
If you look at living creatures under a microscope, you can see that they are made up of little squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw through a microscope small cells in the cork.
He was the first person to see dead cells.
Mixtures and elements can continue from one state to another without change.
Nitrogen in the gas state still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen, and in the liquid state, it's more dense, but the molecules remain the same.
Another example is water, the water pool: two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure in a gas, liquid, or solid state.
Although her physical condition may change, her chemical composition remains the same.
It's what surrounds us and affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
For thousands of years, religious scholars, philosophers, and scientists are studying time.
We are living as a series of events that come from the future through the past today.
Time is also how we measure the duration (length) of events.
You can note for yourself how time passes by watching a cycle repeat, a cyclic event is something that happens over and over again on a regular basis.
Nowadays, computers are used to manipulate images and videos.
Complex animations can be created on computers, and this kind of animation is increasingly used in television and movies.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and compose sounds.
For a long time during the 19th and 20th centuries, people believed that the first settlers in New Zealand were the people of the Mauri who hunted the huge birds called moa.
Thus, the theory confirmed the idea that the Mauri people had migrated from Polynesia to reclaim New Zealand in the sea by establishing an agricultural society.
However, new data indicates that the seariers were a group of mainland Mauries who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, cultivating their own selfish peaceful culture.
There was another tribe in Chatham Archipelago, and it was the Mauri, who migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriories, there were a few more conflicts, and eventually the Moriores were destroyed.
People who have been involved for decades have helped us to appreciate our advantages and passions, openly appreciating hardships and even failures.
By listening to how workers share personal, family and organizational stories, we have obtained valuable testimony about the past, as well as some individuals who have had a positive or negative impact on the culture of the organization.
Understanding your history doesn't mean understanding culture, and yet it helps people to feel where they are in the context of the history of the organization.
In judging success and failure, workers and all involved individuals are more deeply exposed to the values, the mission and the driving forces of the organization.
In this case, mentioning previous examples of business behavior and the resulting successes helped people to be open to new changes and new direct activity of the local church.
Similar success stories have reduced fear of change, creating positive adjustments for future changes.
Models of convergent thinking are ways to solve problems that combine different ideas or areas to find solutions.
This type of thinking focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as setting facts, reapplying existing technologies, and gathering information.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is that there's only one correct answer.
This kind of thinking is connected to a certain science or standard policy.
People with this kind of thinking have logical thinking and can memorize patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
Of course, mankind is the most talented, most talented species that can read the minds of others.
That means that we can successfully predict the perception, intentions, beliefs, knowledge, or desires of others.
Besides these abilities, it's very important to understand the intentions of other people, and it allows us to deal with the possible ambiguity of physical actions.
If you'd, say, seen someone smash a car's glass, you'd probably assume that this person is trying to steal someone's car.
It would have to be viewed differently if he had lost his car keys, and it would have been his own car that he was trying to get into.
MRI is based on the physical phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance (NRI), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (who worked at Stanford University) and Edward Persell (who worked at Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic field and radio waves force atoms to emit tiny radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a physician and research scientist, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance scans as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was issued that became the world's first patent in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the creation of the first MRI scanner, "for the whole body," which he called "Unrelaxed."
And asynchronous communication will give time to meditate and react to others.
This enables students to learn and get information at their own pace and control it.
In addition, there are fewer time limits and more flexible work schedules (Breamer, 1998).
Using the Internet and the World Wide Web allows students access to information at any time.
Instead of waiting for the next personal meeting, students can also ask the instructors questions any time during the day and expect a relatively quick answer.
Postmodern approach to learning offers freedom from absolute principles.
In fact, there's not one good thing you can learn.
Our current experience with all events and information, as well as television shows based on learning, illustrates this.
Many of us watch TV shows that inform us of a process or experience that we will never participate in or apply.
We're never going to make major repairs on a car, we're not going to build a fountain in our backyard, we're not going to Peru to see the ancient ruins, or we're going to rebuild our neighbor's house.
Because of the underwater fiber optic cable lines for Europe and broadband satellite television, Greenland has a good connection to 93 percent of the population who have access to the Internet.
In your hotel or in your host (if you're staying in a guest house or in a private) it's more likely to be a Wi-Fi or an Internet computer, and all settlements have an internet salon or a free Wi-Fi space.
As mentioned above, although the word eskimos remains acceptable in the United States, many Arctic peoples outside the United States, especially in Canada, consider it contemptuous.
It's a word you can hear from the mouth of the native Greenland population, but it's not worth using.
The natives of Greenland call themselves Inuits in Canada and Calaalek (plural of calaalites), or Greenlander, in Greenland.
Crime and unkind treatment of foreigners in general in Greenland are virtually unknown, even in cities, there are no dark neighborhoods.
The cold weather is probably the only real danger to unprepared travelers.
If you visit Greenland in the cold season of the year (the next time you move north, the colder temperature awaits you) you must take warm clothes with you.
Very long days in the summer can lead to sleep problems and related health problems.

To protect the canyon, there are restrictions on permissions that are available on the first day of the month four months before the start.
Thus, permission to visit remote areas of the state on any start date is available on January 1st.
Places in the most popular areas, such as Bright Angel Kempgrand near Fentom Ranch, are usually filled in at the same time as the requests received on the first day of the booking.
There is a limited number of permissions that can be issued as invitations to the entrance, which are available on the principle of who came first, who comes first, who serves first.
South Africaâs car trip is an amazing way to see the beauty of the region as well as to visit places outside the usual tourist routes.
It can be done on a normal machine if you plan it carefully, but it's very good to have 4x4 and in many places you can only get to 4x4 with a long chariot base.
Keep in mind that although South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are.
Visa requirements and expenses differ from country to country, depending on where you came from.

Victoria Falls, a town in western Zimbabwe, across the border from Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The town is near waterfalls, and they are the main tourist attraction; but this popular tourist attraction offers both adventurers and tourists countless opportunities to stay longer.
During the rainy season (from November to March) the amount of water will be larger, and the waterfalls will be more impressive.
You'll get wet if you cross a bridge or walk in the tropical rainfalls that surround the waterfalls.
On the other hand, just because the volume of water is so large, your observation of your own waterfall can be limited â all water!
KV62, KV62, possibly the most famous of the tombs in the Valley, the site that Howard Carter discovered in 1922, the almost untouched royal burial of a young monarch.
Yet, compared with most other royal tombs, the tomb of Tutankhamon is worth visiting, since it is much smaller and decorated.
Anyone who's interested in seeing evidence of damage to the mummy when trying to get it out of the sarcophagus will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders can see.
The famous treasures of the tomb are no longer in it, but were transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors who have limited time are better off devoting it to another place.

In fact, it's more like a way to make people believe that they need to pay more.
Over the northern edge of Machu-Picchu, this steep mountain rises, and often becomes a background for many pictures of ruins.
From below, it looks a little confusing, it's a cool and heavy lift, but most people in good physical shape should have overcome it in about 45 minutes.
Most of the way is arranged by stone tiles, and places with steeper slopes are equipped with steel wires, which serve as extra belts.
However, expect that you will not be able to breathe the air and take care of more steep areas, especially when they are wet, as they may become dangerous in a short period of time.
There's a tiny cave near the summit that has to be passed, it's pretty low and it's kind of cramped.
To visit the wonders and see the wildness of the Galapagos Islands is the best on the boat, following the example of Charles Darwin in 1835.

Most people reserve their seats at an early time (because the boats are usually filled in during the high season).
Make sure that the agent through whom you make the reservation is an expert from the Galapagos Islands who knows the various ships.
This will ensure that your specific interests and/or limitations will match the vessel that suits them most.
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the northern part of Chile was under the control of the Incas, while the roots of the Araukants (Mapuce) lived in central and southern Chile.
Mapuche was also one of the last independent Native American groups that did not absorb Spanish-speaking rule until Chile's independence.

Similar measures in most cases extend for three to six months and take place in places with an area of at least 50 acres [50 ha].
There are many different film formats that have been used over the years, the standard 35mm film (negative 36 times 24 mm) is the most common.
If it's over, it can be refillable quite easily, and it gives a resolution roughly comparable to the current mirror chamber.
Some medium-formed film cameras use the format 6 by 6 centimeters, or more precisely negative 56 by 56 mm.
This gives almost four times the resolution of 35 mm negative (3,136 square millimeters versus 864).
Wildlife is one of the most complex motivations for a photographer, and requires talent, patience, experience, and good equipment.
Although natural photos are usually taken for granted, as in the photograph in general, the photograph is worth thousands of words.
To photograph wildlife, it's often necessary to have a TV lens, but to photograph a pack of birds or a tiny creature, other lenses may be needed.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules about photographing for commercial purposes.

If you travel to a developing country for the first time â or just to a new part of the world â you do not need to underestimate potential cultural shock.
Many experienced travelers, who often travel frequently, have been exhausted by the novelty of traveling to developing countries, where cultural situations can often arise that need to be adapted to.
Especially in the early days should you consider spending on Western style and quality hotels, food and services that will help you to aclimate.
Don't sleep on a mattress or on a plaster on the ground in areas you don't know about native fauna.
If you're going to take the game, take a layoutator or hammock with you to stay as far away from snakes, scorpions, and so forth as possible.
Add to your home comfort a delicious coffee in the morning and a relaxing, hummi tea for the night.
When you're resting at home, you've got time to give yourself a nap and spend more time preparing something special.
If you feel passion for adventure, use the opportunity to drink juice or mix strips:
Perhaps you will discover for yourself a simple drink that can be prepared for breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a different drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in areas where you don't often go.
For those who are not familiar with medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious have different semantics.
Infectious disease is a disease caused by pathogens such as virus, bacteria, fungus, or other parasites.
Infectious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted if near an infected person.
Many governments require guests who come in, or residents who leave the country of vaccines from all kinds of diseases.
These requirements often depend on which countries the traveler has visited or is planning to visit.
One advantage of Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it offers countless high-quality options for families.
People in other areas often refer to family kindness as the main reason for moving there, and visitors often note that it is easy for cities to enjoy their children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of conveniences for children in the Charlotte Apptown region has increased exponentially.
taxis are usually not used by Charlotte's families, although they may be useful under certain circumstances.
There's an extra payment for the transport of more than 2 passengers, so this could be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica is the coolest place on earth around the South Pole.
Travel is expensive, requires good physical shape, can take place only in the summer of November to February, and is largely confined to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
A couple thousand personnel live here in the summer on about four dozen databases, mostly in those areas; few are left to winter.
Inner Antarctica is a deserted plateau that is covered with two to three miles [2-3 km] of ice.
From time to time, special air tours are sent to the interior of the country for climbing or to reach a pole where there is a large base.
The South Pole Travers (or Shose) is a 1,600-mile route from the McMurdo station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
It's an embered snow, the cracks of which were saturated and marked with flags. You can drive only on specialized tractors, dragging sleds with fuel and supplies.
They're not too twisty, so to get to the plateau, the route makes a long hook around the Transrctic Mountains.
The most common causes of winter crashes are slippery roads, pavements, and especially staircases.
At least you need shoes with the right sole, summer shoes usually crawl on ice and snow, even some winter boots are imperfect.
The pattern should be deep enough, at least 5 mm (1/5 inch) and the material should be soft enough at cold temperatures.
Some shoes have spikes, and there are additional equipment with spikes for slippery surfaces suitable for most shoes and shoes, for heels or for heels and soles.
The sole should be low and wide. Sand, gravel, or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered on roads or tracks to increase friction.
The Lavins are not an anomaly; the steep slopes can hold only a certain amount of snow, and its excesses will descend in a lava.
The problem is that the snow is sticky, so it has to be given some initial pulse to go down, and the east of a certain amount of snow can be a trigger mechanism for the rest of the snow mass.
Sometimes it's caused by the heat of the snow under the sun, sometimes by more snow, sometimes by other natural phenomena, and often by man.
The tornado is a very low - pressure air column that spins and sucks the surrounding air inside and up.
They create strong winds (often 100 to 200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, moving them while the tornado is moving.
They start in the form of winds descending from thunder clouds and turn into tornados when they get to the ground.
Personal VPN providers (virtual private networks) are an excellent way to avoid both political censor and commercial IP-geofilitration.
They're better than web proxy for a number of reasons: they're redirecting all the Internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer higher bandwidth and better service quality, they're encrypted, so it's harder to track.
Information companies usually lie about the goal, claiming that it's "to prevent pirates."
In fact, regional codes have no effect on illegal copying; a bit-accurate copy of the disk, as well as the original, will be wonderfully played on any device.
The actual goal is to give these companies more control over their markets; it's all about money.
Since the calls are broadcast on the Internet, you do not need to use a telephone company near your home or stay.
There is also no requirement to get a local number from the community where you live; you can get a satellite connection to the Internet in Chicago, Alaska, and select a number that says you're in sunny Arizona.
It's often necessary to buy an international number separately, which allows TMZ phones to call you, and where the number comes from is of great importance to those who call you.
Text translation programs in real time are apps that can automatically translate entire text from one language to another.
Some plugins in this category may even translate texts into foreign languages on signs or other objects in the real world when a user sends a smartphone to these objects.
The machine translation has improved significantly, and is now often offering more or less correct translations (and less often barbarity), but it is necessary to keep on the watch because things may be wrong.
One of the most outstanding plugins in this category is Google Translate, which makes offline translation possible after downloading the necessary language data.
Using GPS navigation applications on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate to areas outside your home country.
Buying a new GPS map, or an offline GPS device can save money, or you can rent it from a car rental company.
If you do not have a connection to transmit data to your phone or when it is outside the network, their productivity may be limited or inaccessible.

Most of the cards will be used to call in any direction, but some have a convenient fare for calling in certain groups of countries.
These services are often accessed by means of a free telephone number that can be called from most machines.
Normal photography rules are also distributed to video recordings, even stricter.
If it's forbidden to just photograph something, don't even think about recording it on the video.

Generally, the requirements and the process of applying for a student's visa are different from the procedure for applying for a regular tourist or business visa.
For most countries, you will need a letter of invitation from the institution where you want to study, as well as proof of the cost to support yourself during at least the first year of your studies.
To get detailed requirements, ask about them at the institution, and so do the immigration department for the country you want to learn from.
Unless you're not a diplomat, working abroad usually means you're going to be taxing the income statement in the country you're actually living in.
Income taxes vary from country to country, and tax rates and quota vary greatly.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income taxes are imposed at both federal and local levels, so the rates and rates vary from region to region.

Voluntarily traveling is a great way to do something significant, but it's not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a wonderful way to learn a different culture, to get to know new people, to learn about themselves, to feel the potential, and even to acquire new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch out the budget to allow longer stays in some place, because many volunteer jobs provide housing and food, and some pay a low wage.
The Vikings used Russian water routes to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, part of which can still be used. Check if special permits are needed because they may be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltian canal connects the Arctic Ice Ocean with the Baltic Sea through Onees, Lados, and St. Petersburg Lake, mainly on rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Walga, so a passage from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible.

In short, you'll be distributing messages with offers of your help, coming in docks, approaching people who clean their yachts, trying to contact sailors in bars, etc.
Try to communicate with as many people as possible. After a while, all of you will know and tell you which boat is now looking for people.
Select carefully among the members of the airline alliance a company that provides bonus programs.

Airlines, such as Emiraiths, Etihad Airways, Katar Airways, and Turkish Airlines have expanded their services in Africa and are offering flights to many large cities in Africa at competitive prices, compared with other European airlines.
By 2014, Turkish airlines have flown up to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra time on your way, compare your total cost of travel to Africa with your travel fare in other countries around the world.
For all those places outside Africa, don't forget to add the cost to the cost of visa, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc.
If you want to travel the world only in the Southern Hemisphere, the choice of flights and directions is limited because of the absence of transocean routes.
No airline alliance covers all three ocean intersections in the Southern Hemisphere (and Skytim does not cover any intersection).
However, Star Alliance covers everything except the South-eastern Pacific Ocean from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is the LATAM Oneworld flight.
This flight is not the only option if you want to go through the South Pacific and the West Coast of South America. (See below)
In 1994 the Nagorno Karabach, a region inhabited by ethnic Armenians, waged war against the Azeri.
The new republic was created with the support of Armenia, but none of the formed states, not even Armenia, officially recognized it.
The diplomatic disputes over this region continue to obscure the relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Nederland: Graphendorfel) is a famous 17th-century area surrounded by the inner city of Amsterdam.

The different types of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are somewhat different from the French spoken in France, although they are similar enough to make people understand each other.
In particular, the system of numeration in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some small features that differ from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.
Nevertheless, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would learn the standard French language at school to understand you, even if you were using the standard French numbering system.
In many parts of the world, waving hands is a friendly gesture, meaning "hello."
However, in Malaysia, at least among Malays who live in rural areas, this means âovertake, â similarly tilted to the body of the pointing finger of a gesture used in some Western countries and should be used only for this purpose.
Similarly, a British tourist in Spain may confuse the farewell gesture of wavering a palm to himself (not to the one being waved) with a gesture calling for return.
Assistant languages are artificial or created languages to promote communication among nations that otherwise would have difficulty communicating.
They have nothing to do with the lingua Franca, which are natural or organic languages that have become dominant for one reason or another as a way of communicating between mediums of different languages.
In the hot weather, travelers can see the merging that creates an illusion of water (or other things).
They can be dangerous, for a traveler who marries a marble will waste precious energy and water supplies.
Even the hottest desert itself can become extremely cold at night, and hypothermia is a real danger when there is no warm clothing.
If you decide to walk through the rain forest, especially in the summer, you have to think of mosquitoes.
Even if you're traveling through the subtropical forest, a few seconds at open doors while you're getting in the car, enough for mosquitoes to get into the car with you.
The bird flu, or official name "avian influenza", can infect both birds and mammals.
Some cases were fatal, but not more than a thousand cases were reported.

For Norway, the typical steep fjords and valleys, which move sharply to high, more or less levels of captivity.
These captives are often called "widde," which means a wide and open space without a forest, a vast breadth.
In Rugalan and Anderi, they're commonly called gays, that is, deprived of trees in a swampy area, often covered with heath.
The glaciers don't stand still, they crawl from the mountain, and they cause cracks and cracks of ice that you can't see through the snow bridges.
Walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse, and holes can close.
Huge rocks on the edges of glaciers break off, fall down, or perhaps jump off or fall away from the edge.
The tourist season at the mountain stations reaches its peak during the woman's summer.
In winter, however, their beauty and charm are different, and many mountain stations have high snow levels and are offering forms of active recreation, such as skiing and snowboarding.
