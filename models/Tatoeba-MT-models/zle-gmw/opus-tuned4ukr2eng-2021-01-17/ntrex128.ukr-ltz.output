The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that they will be “associating with the mappets ”
Some CAs are horrified by the recommendation to change the title of their office to “A member of the Parliament of Wales” (MWP).
This recommendation came about through plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Parliament of Wales".
WHEN the whole political spectrum is concerned that it might make fun of you.
One Cha from the Laborists claimed that his group was worried about the Romans from Twp and Pwp.
To readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "unintelligible", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
The Wales Party said that his group was generally "not satisfied" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said that his group was “inbiased ” about changing the name, but noted that MWP could quickly become a“mapet. ”
In this context, the Welsh pronunciation “w ” is similar to the Yorkshir English pronunciation “u ”
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently developing legislation to change names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be taken by the members themselves. ”
The Welsse Self-rule Act of 2016 gives the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly in Wales Parliament received wide support.
In terms of what's called the CA, the commission suggests that they be called the "WMP members of the Parliament of Wales," or WMP, but the MWP option received the most public support.
Of course, the CA offers alternatives, but trying to agree can cause problems to head Alina Jones, who has to submit a change bill for a few weeks.
The Reform Law will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including the rules of rejection of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
They'll have a final vote on their new name when they're discussing legislation.
The Macedonians are going to vote on a petition for a change in the name of the country
On Sunday, the voters will vote to change the name of the country to the Northern Macedonia Republic.
The vote was organized to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their Northern Neighbor is a claim to the territory of Greece, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonian membership in the EU and NATO.
President Georg John of Macedonia, who opposes the change of name consultation, declared that he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, the Council’s supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, say that the change in the name is simply the price to pay for the EU and NATO.
Call St. Martin silently because the churches of Harlem are going through difficult times.
“Old people I used to associate with say that there was a bar and a church in every corner here, ” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither of them nor any of them."
He thinks that it's understandable that the bars are gone:
People are being socialized in a different way today.
The bars are no longer the local living room where they regularly go."
As far as churches are concerned, Adams fears that the money from the asset sale will not last as long as the leaders expect, and "they'll end up where they started sooner or later."
The churches, he added, could replace houses with condominiums, and there would be people living there who would not help the shrines that remained nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” Adams explained,“so this will speed up the day when all these churches will close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to the condominiums will become their parishioners. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Communal Church, built in 1870, and St. Martin, ten years after it.
The Native white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The Black Community, which held rituals nearby, was entitled to the property of the building.
Saint-Martin moved to the black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of scattering merchants on 125th street, Harlem's main trading street, and those merchants refused to hire blacks and raise them in service.
In 1939 the fire severely damaged the building, but the parishioners of Father Johnson wanted to rebuild it and set up a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Johnson's father in St. Martin, proudly called the Carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the Carillon in July called it a different term: “Cultural Treasure ” and“ Unchangeable Historical Instrument. ”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that this is the world's first carillon played by black musician Dionysio A. Linda, who 18 years ago moved to the larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivester, he was never replaced in St. Martin.
What's going on in St. Martin over the last few months is a complicated story about architects and subscribings, some of whom have been involved by church leaders, others by bishops.
The Council, the governing body of the parish, which is made up of Christian leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, concerned that the diocese would “try to pass on the expenses ” to the council, while the Council did not participate in hiring the architects and substitutors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that there was no transparency on the part of the diocese.
Acula injured a 13-year-old boy who was pruning behind lobsters in California.
According to official figures, on Saturday the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, and the boy ran behind the lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place almost 7 a.m. at Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that Saturday morning he had spent about half an hour durning with his friends when he heard the boy crying for help, and along with the group sailed to him to get him out of the water.
Hummel at first thought it was just a fascination with the caught lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!
I've been bitten.
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his collarbone was completely broken.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, 'A shark in the water!' he added.
The boy was taken to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego on a whirlwind, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
The rescue captain Larry Giles on the media biniting told the media that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in the area, but it was found that it was not dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper part of the body.
For investigation and security purposes, 48 hours of access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swam in Encinitas was blocked by the authorities.
Giles noted that over 135 shark species live in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The Sunsbury's plans to enter the British cosmetics market.
The Suninsbury's are going to compete with Bots, Superdrug and Debenhams by means of island-like cosmetics, like the ones in the department store.
As part of the increased entry into the British cosmetic market at a cost of £2.8 billion (continuing to increase at a time when the sales of clothing and household goods are declining) the increased island with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country, and in the next year, if the idea is successful, the island will appear in other stores.
Invests in cosmetics are linked to supermarkets looking for ways to use the field space that used to be used on television, microwave ovens, and household goods.
The Suninsbury's stated that they would double the cosmetics assortment and offer up to 3,000 brands, including the first brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Mybelline, and Burt's Bees will get more space: brand zones like those of Bots stores will appear.
Supermarket also updates the Botique cosmetics assortment: now most of the goods presented will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, the retailer of France Shoop perfume test his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second one opens at Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and moving to small amounts of food each day in small shops make supermarkets make extra effort to attract visitors.
Mike Coope, executive director of Sciencebury's, said that their stores would look more like department stores, because the supermarket network is trying to resist Aldi and Lidl Discounters with more services and non-food products.
The Sunsbury's opening the Argos Departments in hundreds of their stores, also opening a series of Habitats.Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claimed to have increased sales of food goods, and made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the cosmetic and pharmaceutical sections failed.
The Sainsbury's test of cooperation with Bots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a debate about how to divide the profits from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sáinsbury's sold their pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) Célesio, owner of the Loyds Pharmacey network, for £125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an extended suite of leather brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vicky, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of the Sunsbury, stated: “We have changed the appearance of our cosmetic island to make the atmosphere more pleasant to the customers.
We also invested in specially trained counselors who would be able to give advice.
The brands we offer are designed to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which forms a competition for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "scattered" because Holly Willoughby went out of a deal worth 11 million pounds sterling
Peter Jones's Dragon Lion Star "Drake Lift" because Holly Willoughby's TV announcer broke the deal with his brand of goods for life (the contract cost is 11 million pounds sterling) to focus on new legislation from Marks & Spacer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for a brand of house clothes and an executable of Truly.
The couple's business was connected to the brand of Goop Guinette Peltrow.
This Morning, a 37-year-old programmer, announced her departure for Instagram.
Holly Willoughby led Peter Jones to the story of when at the last moment he emerged from their lucrative business of goods for life to focus on the new lucrative accounts of Marks & Spacer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is “scattered ” when a gold girl on TV confessed at a busy Tuesday meeting at the Johns business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, when a gold girl confessed on TV at a busy Tuesday afternoon meeting in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements worth £1.5 million mean that she no longer has enough time to dedicate his joint brand of house clothes and axessures to Truly.
This business was related to the brand of Goop Guinett Peltrow and was expected to double the value of Willoughby, which is estimated to be 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby informed Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones flew from Britain to one of his rest homes.
The source reported: “Truly no doubt was Holly’s chief priority.
He was to be her long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to quit business was astonished by all interested parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
At the headquarters in Marlowe, a complete set of things ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the entry of Lead This Morning, one of Britain's most highly paid stars, could cost firms millions of dollars because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes) and create further delay at start-up.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Boldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp created True in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
The couple together held holidays, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of a company called the Boldwin Company, which is involved in television production.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as lead I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
The source near Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
Hard conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he would get from news media for commenting on what someone would think to be “non-presiding, ” as well as for the very positive attitude toward North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump make such a big deal? --
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news announcer. --
I didn't go to anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step toward deunucularization in North Korea.
But the negotiations on deuclarization have gone into the crooked corner.
More than three months after June’s summit in Singapore, North Korea’s leading North Korean missionary, Young Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see “the right reaction ” from the United States to its first disarmament efforts.
Instead, he remarked, the U.S. continues to carry on with the pressures.
Trump was much more optimistic in giving a speech at his rally.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea, ” he stated.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such a beautiful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kimom had produced positive results: the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remaining American military officers to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kimm.
"It's so easy to behave as president, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this bit of a packed stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the Lomboca earthquake, foreign non-government organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboca population were affected, the national catastrophe was not declared, and this is a prelude to international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not seek international assistance, so this is a bit difficult, ” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Even though Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Pale, it is not yet known if foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Pala to determine whether international organizations could provide assistance.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains horrendously unprepared to the wrath of nature.
In the province of Aceh, tsunami shelters have been built, but they are not characteristic of other coastlines.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Pala, although the warning was an active warning, likely contributed to death.
Moving between a multitude of Indonesian islands is not just at the best of times.
Natural disasters make logic even more difficult.
The medical ship that was in Lomboca to treat earthquake victims sails to Pala, but at least three days from now it will be possible to get to the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the infrastructure of Indonesia the basis of his election campaign and has increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the deficit in funding has created problems for Mr. Joko's administration, who is planning to change next year.
Mr. Joko's efforts also interfere with the ongoing interfaith strife in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands of people being thrown out of their homes as a result of the opposition of Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets with the use of machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

He threw the ball on his left leg and loaded it in the direction of his long pants.
The ball flew high above the finer in the direction of the upper right corner of the gate.
He flew over the leaping Kepa Arrisabalah and fell into the gate.
"It was just trying to take that position so as not to waste time, players like Shachiri always go into attack as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Starridge LiverpoolFC.com. --
I saw Kante coming, and I made one touch, and I didn't think too much about it, and I just took the ball.
With a score of 1-0 after the first time the Belgian star Eden Azar scored a goal for the 25th minute.
The blue attacker passed the pass back to Mateo Kovaccich, turned around the middle of the field, and ran fast for half the Liverpool.
Kovacicz quickly played the wall in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice penetrating pass that brought Azar to the penalty.
Azar's got a defense runner and he hit his left foot in a long-distance net, and the ball passed past the Liverpool gateway by Aliceson Becker.
Liverpool is playing against Napoli in the group stage of the League of Champions at 3 p.m. Wednesday at the São Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Texas plays with Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.

Cromwell's Statue near Parliament becomes a new monument that's going to be struck by "the rewrite of history"
The removal of the statue would have been a well deserved payment for the destruction of many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical puritan followers in the Taliban style.
But Cromwell's Community called Mr. Creek's proposal "unclear" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of Cromwell Community, said: “In view of the current debate about the taking of statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace was inevitable. ”
Iconocracy in English civil wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his orders.
Cromwell will probably be sacrificed undeservedly for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell by the sculptor William Hamo Thorneicroft is a testimony to the 19th century mood and part of the historical history of the figure, which many think is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many who, probably more recently in the late 19th century than now, consider Cromwell a defender of Parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether such an idea is completely accurate is the subject of the historical debate that continues.
Undoubtedly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures that represents one side of this conflict.
It is also worth celebrating and venerating his accomplishments as Lord Protector."
The killer pig pig destroyed a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the name of Yuan was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pigyard in a market in Liupangshui, Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
In Sinin, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig pig is about to vaccinate pigs in a pigyard.
It's reported that on Wednesday he went out with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and saw that the pigyard door was open.
The brother said that the pigyard had a big boar with blood on its mouth.
The medical and judicial experts have confirmed that the 249-pound boar destroyed the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodguilty and deformed, ” stated a cousin of the victim with the name Wu, quoted by Guiiang Evening News.
The security camera record shows Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed a man was not of Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked to prevent her from attacking people.
It is reported that the seven of us, Yuan, and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and caused a man severe injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 - pound [295 kg] pig kept a Welsh farmer clamped to a tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can become a triger.
They're just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with proper respect, ” he said.
Hurricane Rosa’s surplus will bring heavy showers to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is shrinking, moving over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the near future, Rosa will bring rains with floods north of Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rosa had winds at speeds of 125 miles per hour (this hurricane category 1) 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose's supposed to go north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form a torrent that is heading east to the west coast of the United States, and when Rosa approaches the lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it starts to push strong tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 centimeters of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, on the nearest days, tropical moisture, which interacts with the approaching valley, will produce strong showers in the southwest.
In this area, from 2.54 to 10.2 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flooding, garbage streams, and the possibility of desert shifts.
Strong tropical moisture will cause rainfall to increase to between 5 and 7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10.2 centimeters of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in the large area of Arizona.
Floods can be flooded under severe worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We insist on not going to the desert on foot, for there may be rain showers of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can make canyons stormy rivers, and thunderstorms can bring winds and dust storms.
When the rain approaches, it will cause intense rain in some parts of the north coast of California.
The rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause low waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain shower in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, and on Monday and Tuesday night, the rain will become more extensive.
It's going to rain a lot over the For Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature changes throughout the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this causes a sharp decrease in temperature at short distances.
Sunday will be a beautiful example of a dramatic temperature change in the central United States.
This is almost a 7-degree difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and DeMoines, Iowa.
During the next few days, summer heat will try to return and spread.
The U.S. is expected to be warm by October in a large area of the center and east of the United States, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast is expected to be 27 degrees Celsius.
New York temperatures can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long-term forecast of weather, there is a high probability of average temperature exceedance in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people were watching the Britta Cavanaugh hearing.
On Thursday, over 20 million people on six television networks watched the exciting testimony of a candidate for the position of Justice of the Supreme Court, Britta Cavanaugh, and Christine Blazey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, supposedly occurring in the 1980s.
The political opposition continued, the channels interrupted the scheduled programs to report the latest news on Friday: an agreement prepared by senator Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week FBI investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh had drunk on her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotional testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It's very likely that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people were watching this, as reported by the Nielsen research company.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Could not immediately get numbers on other networks that also showed the listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
For comparison, such an audience is the size of an audience that watches a playoff or Oscar prize.
The Fox News Channel, whose fans strongly supported Cavanaugh's assignment, was the leader of all channels during a day-long hearing, with an average audience of 5.69 million, at Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNC had 2.89 million, CNN had 2.52 million.
The interview remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the central title of the Friday drama.
The office of this moderate republic published a statement that he was going to vote for Cavanaugh, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras were caught shouting at Flake when he tried to take the elevator to the Court Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was yelled, which was broadcast in direct air on CNN.
"I am standing right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have authority, but countless women are powerless."
Flake reported that his office published the application and, before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more about hearing the committee.
All cable and wide - air channels broadcast directly hours later, when the Court Committee was to vote to advance Cavanaugh’s candidate to the Senate in its entirety.
Flake said he'd only do it if he knew that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which requires a democratic minority.
Flake was partially persuaded to talk to his friend, senator-democracy Chris Coons.
After talking to Kuns, and then with a few more senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was influenced because it was obvious that the Republicans would have no votes to appoint Cavanaugh's candidate without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May blames critics for "political games" around Brexit.
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to withdraw from the European Union of playing politics with future Britain and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May attended a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview that followed the interview of Theresa on the front page of the newspaper, the former foreign minister of her government, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Checkers Plan for Brexit, stating that to offer Britain and the EU to draw the customs of each other “absolutely absurd. ”

The volcano throws ashes into Mexico City
Popocatepetl’s outburst of ash has reached the southern regions of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Warning Center on Saturday urged the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater began to be active and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered in 24 hours.
The center tracked numerous noises and shocks.
Photos on social networks show thin layers of ash on the frontal glass of automobiles in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Chimimilko.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of a volcano that is 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake with a magnitude of 2.1 in central Mexico in September 1951.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police encountered Catalan Separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who claimed independence encountered a police unit, thousands of people joined protesters to celebrate the first anniversary of the Katalonia vote on the division.
The proseparatist group with masks, held back by special forces, threw them with eggs and powdered paint that created dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually full of tourists.
Butts took place and later on that day, the police used sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, groups of independenceists who scanned, "Let's not forget, let's not forgive," ran into the country's conservationists who shouted, "Let's live Spain.
According to a local press report, fourteen people were helped with light injuries suffered during the protests.
A year after the October 1th conference, which Madrid declared illegal but celebrated by Catalan separatists, the tension in the region of independence remains high.
The majority of the voters voted for independence, but the turnout was low, because most of those who opposed the division boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in brutal collisions last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in election stations throughout the region.
The independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow a different route.
The 68-year-old Narciss Termes, the electrician who participated in the seperatorial protest with his wife, claimed that he no longer had the hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents weep with joy that they can vote, but now we're in a deaf corner, ” he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that promote independence failed to maintain the momentum of this year, because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisonment awaiting trial for their participation in the cabinet and subsequent declaration of independence.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took a protest about police support on the phone, claimed that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
He said, “The tension is increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the insulator since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament the following year.
“The status of a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and represses that we see from the Spanish government, ” he said.
The men were arrested after the car entered the house.
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after the car entered a house in Londonderra several times.
The incident took place at Ballingard Crescent Thursday, 7:30 p.m., British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noticed that the gate and the house were damaged.
It's quite possible that at some point a crossbow was fired at the car.
Menga hit Menga gave Livingstone victory over Rangers with a score of 1-0
The first goal of Dolly Menga in Livingstone was won.
High in the Livingstone class, he stunned the Rangers and brought Stephen Gerrard the second of 18 games as manager of the Iybrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit was crucial: Gary Holt's team rose one level in a second from the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team won no victory at the Prime Minister's departure this season and next Sunday will play with the Hards leaders, from whom it is eight points behind.
Before that, Thursday, the Rangers will receive the “Rad Vienna ” within the League of Europe.
In the meantime, Livingstone continues its invincible march to six games in the division, and Chief Trainer Holt has not lost since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone misses the odds that impure guests offer.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they killed them, because their straightforwardness creates Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but struck along the gate, and then Alan Lithow punched the gate after he had resisted and accepted the crash of Craig Hulkett along the gate that he had made his head.
The hosts were satisfied that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew that they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
That's how the crucial goal was hit.
The Rangers skipped their free shot, and Livingstone opened up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson attacked Menga, who took the ball and killed him from the center of the penalty room.
The Rangers had been dominated by the ball until this stage, but the protection of the owners of the field proved to be invincible, and the gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, was generally not disturbed.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike Kelly.
Scott Pittman's blow hit Holkeeper Rangers by Allan McGregor, and Lithow hit the gate in another standard combination of Livingstone.
The Naves continually flew into Livingstone's fines and were continually neutralized, and two applications were rejected after the Hulkett attack on Glenn Middleton, who was replaced, and after playing with his hand.
Livingstone Phenomene: analysis
-- Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony MacAroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal game and Livingstone result.
Everyone played very well, and they continued to exceed the expectations of this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and composition changed little after returning to the highest level, but you have to give Holt credit for the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett played hugely, very well organized the defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Warral watch all the time.
The Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerrard's leadership, but now they're not going to reach much of those standards.
They didn't have enough last ball -- only once they broke the defense of the landlords -- and it was kind of a wake for the Rangers, which ended up in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was received in Cologne in a vague way
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there were smiles and blue skys.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's conflicting visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
There have been some disputes among them on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police refused to let 25,000 people gather before the mosque, but many of the president's supporters still came to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — including many Kurds — have also made themselves hear, condemning Erdogan’s politics and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
The bidirectional protests illustrate the ambiguity of the guest, whom some German Turks called hero and others called dictator.
Depford road accident: a cyclist killed in a collision with a car
The bicyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the Bestwood Street Crossroads and Evelyn Street on a live road in the Deptford area southeast of town about 10:15 a.m. British Standard Time.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
This accident took place a few months after another cyclist died after a driver escaped from an adventure on Childers Street about 1.6 km from the Saturday accident.
The London Police reported that they were working on setting up a man to inform his closest relatives.
Drives are forbidden and bus routes have been changed, and motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long-Lartine Prison: Six jailers injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured by riots in a men's prison of strict security, reported to the prison administration.
The riot at Her Majesty Long-Lartin's prison in Worcestershire started about 9:30 p.m. British standard time on Sunday and is still going on.
To stop the unrest, the eight incarcerated prisoners and localized in one wing were summoned by a special unit called "Tornado".
The officers were given medical attention in connection with traumatic facial injuries received at the scene.
A representative of the prison service commented: “In order to resolve an incident in the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, a specially trained prison staff was involved.
Six coworkers received medical attention in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and their prison sentences can be extended."
Her Majesty Long-Lartin's prison has more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
June reported that the warden of the prison had been sent to hospital treatment after a prisoner's assault.
In October last year, the Special Police Department was summoned to prison to stop the serious riots in which jailers were attacked with billiard layers
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flood floods.
Tropic depression rarely hits Arizona, but it can happen early next week, because the remains of Hurricane Rosa are heading through the southwest desert, creating the risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already published flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to south and east Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
She's expecting Rose to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and it's raining on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
Catherine in 1967 was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest predictions of the National Center for Hurricanes, the region of Mogallon Rome in Arizona is estimated to be between 5.08 and 10.1 inches, and places up to 15.224 inches in rainfall.
Other regions of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Baza, are likely to receive from 2.54 to 5.08 cm rain, possibly up to 10.6 cm.
Where there is no risk of torrential flooding, Rose’s rain can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these showers are likely to be useful because the southwest is now experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring center, a little over 40 percent of the Arizona area suffers at least from extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, reports Weather.com.
First of all, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to shifts on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in the middle of a storm at a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm encounters more cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore shrinks.
In this way, it is expected that the storm will cause a shift in Mexico during the day or Monday night in the storm of the Tropic Storm.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a high risk of flooding.
“It is expected that the total rainfall from Lower California to Northwest Sunora will range from 7.62 to 15.224 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm in places, ” reportsweather.com.
And then Rosa will go north through Mexico like a tropical storm, get the Arizona border early in the morning like a tropical depression that's going to go north through Arizona and late in the evening on Tuesday to South Utah.
“The basic danger expected of Rose or her remains is the very heavy rains in Lower California, northwest Sonouri, and southwest of the American desert, ” reports the National Center for Hurricanes.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life - threatening torrents and torrents of waste in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer-Norton attack: four people arrested who attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy with knives was found in Somerset.
The wounded teenager was found in the Excelsior-Terras area at Midsomer-Norton about 4:00 p.m. British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, informed the Avon and Somerset police.
Police are asking to respond to anyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Tramp says that Cavanaugh was “tormented by veneration and anger ” by the Democratic Party
“The Voice of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party, ” announced Trump at a rally in Willinga, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh had been “suffered and angered ” by the Democratic Party during the entire hanging process.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, violently and emotionally denying the charge that Christine Blazey Ford had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about the charges she had dropped.
On Saturday, the president declared that on that day, “the American people saw Cavanaugh’s brilliantness, character and courage. ”
“The Voice for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for one of the most perfect lawyers of our time, a lawyer with excellent public service experience, ” he said to a mob of adherents in West Virginia.
President Cavanaugh's speech was quoted side by side when he spoke about the importance of the Republican presence in mid-term elections.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will be held.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, ” he said.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the democracy mission was to “oppose and hinder. ”
The first key procedure vote in the Senate for Cavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, and CNN was informed by a assistant of one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number of casualties is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many were washed into the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawes, claiming the country's authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) hit the shore in the dark, killing many to death and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake with an earthquake of 7,5 points.
“When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and did not immediately begin to flee, and they were victims, ” declared the BNPP, a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPP), in Djakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
"It wasn't just tsunamis, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that, before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed the trees and survived, he added.
Some 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palou.
Aerial photos published by the Disaster Management Agency show that many buildings and stores have been destroyed, bridges have been turned and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The push in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Rating and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by a major earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have contributed to the tsunami force, it was an agency.
Nugroho called the damage “wide-scale ” and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
Some victims were found under wrecks of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing without word.
Nugroho noted that victims and injuries could be greater than 300 kilometers (190 miles) along the coastline north of Pala in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn’t get any information from Donghala, ” said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, says the Red Cross declaration, and it adds that his staff and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
“It is already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger, ” says the report.
On Saturday, the agency received a wide range of criticism for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Pale, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
On the amateur images that people shared in social networking, you can see a man on the top of the house shouting wild warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street under the building.
Within a few minutes, the wall of the water struck the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the frames immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power shutdown that cut off the connection around Pale, which made it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
Military officials began sending cargo planes with help from Djakarta and other cities, informed the authorities, but evacuated people still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city airport has been opened for help only, and it will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centers in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision fellow workers from Donghala have safely reached the city of Palu, where they hide in tarpaula tents installed in the yard of their office, but on the way they saw desert scenes, said Mr. Dosseba.
“They told me that they had seen many destroyed houses, ” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief teams began to take decisive action to eliminate the effects of the disaster, some complained that foreign humanitarian aid workers with great experience were not allowed to go to Pale.
Under Indonesian rules, financing, supplying and providing personnel from abroad can only begin if disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level, ” observed Aolia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted."
The second night was already down on Pala after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, and friends and families of those who had not yet been found still hoped that the arrival of their loved ones would be a miracle to cover these dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy got out of the sewer.
On Sunday the rescue workers got a woman who lay under stone for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Hendon Subandono, a trainer of the Indonesian National Paraplanery Team, trained two missing paraplaners to participate in Asian games that had been held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paralysts trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandaga, were his disciples.
"As an older paraplanet, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon tells us that a few hours after news of the ruining of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to a paralyzing community, he was desperately sending messages to WhatsApp to the opponents of Palu who were at the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray mark, not with double blue ticks.
"I think that means that the message has not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took 26,750 dollars when the ATM was reloaded at the Newsport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole 26,750 dollars from a worker, Bink, who gasped an ATM at the Newport on the Levee, a news report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy on the news.
While he was busy, another man "walked back to fellow worker Brink" and stole a sack of money to fill in.
The Witnesses have noticed a number of suspects who escaped from the scene of the crime, but the police have not indicated the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these persons should contact the Newport police at number 859,232-3680.
Kanier West: the reper changes its name to E
Repper Canier West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, announcing a change on Twitter, he wrote: “Before officially known as Kanier West. ”
41-year-old West was called Y for a while, and he used this shortcut as a title for his album released in June.
The change took place just before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show he replaces a singer named Ariano Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," reported the author of the show.
It's not just a shortening of the current professional name, but West used to say that it has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe that 'e' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you', ” told West earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio talker Big Boy. — — —
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Canier, which means "one," was shortened to just E -- it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanier is one of a few famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deady, P. Grandpa and Grandpa, announced this year that he had chosen Love and Breaser Love.
West's former colleague, JAZI, also experimented with defiance and capital letters.
President Andrés Manuel López Abrador of Mexico promises not to use an army against civilians
Andres Manuel López Abrador, the newly elected president of Mexico, promised never to use an army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloodguilt of students.
On Saturday, on Tlatelloloco, López Abrador promised “never to use an army to suppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, the military fired a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people, and at the time, the left-wing student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
Lópes Abrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead youths to criminal gangs.
U. States need to double funding in artificial intelligence
Since China is increasing activity in artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount they spend on research in this field, and believes that the investor and practices in the ClI Kai-Foo Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These comments were given after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the MI, although the U.S. does not have a formal strategy in the Hl area.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it wants to become #1 in the innovation of the Sl until 1930.
“The double budget for the SHI study would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are preparing for the next gap in the Sl, ” said Lee.
Double funding can double the probability that the next big breakthrough in the U.S.H.S. is going to be made in the U.S., said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book entitled "The Sl: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of the Synovation Ventures Foundation, who invested in Face++, one of the most famous MI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mallon University, he was working on the SH system, who played the best American player in Othello, and later executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee observed earlier competitions with technology conducted by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge of Advanced Defense Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when they would be next to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, said Lee.
“It's not China taking academic leaders, it's corporations, ” he remarked.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities in recent years to work on the Sl.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. to increase efforts in the field of MI.
"I think the Green Map should be automatically offered to the SHI scientific candidates," he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the development of the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 1951.
The National Fund for Natural Science of China provides funding to people who work in academic institutions, just as the National Science Fund and other U.S. government agencies are giving money to American researchers, and the quality of academic work in China is below, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense had set up the United Center for Artificial Intellect, which was designed to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House had announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intellect.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
In the case of the National Science Fund, it now invests over $100 million a year in the SEI study.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislator, who wanted to establish a Commission for National Security of the Artificial Intellect, did not take any action within a few months.
The Macedonians vote at the conference to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday at a protest on whether to change the name of the country to the Northern Macedonia Republic, which would allow for the resolution of a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia’s possibility of membership in Europe and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the Northern Neighbor is a claim to its territory, and imposed a ban on Macedonia's entry to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments concluded a treaty on the basis of a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the treaty claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov declared that he would not vote at the protest, and the boycott campaign raises doubts about whether a minimum 50% vote will be reached, which will allow it to be considered valid.
The question in the resolution's Bulletin is, "Do you support the membership of NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement with Greece?"
The adherents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, say that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should be paid for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonian youths, so that it could live freely under the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgiewski in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote does not involve legal obligations, enough members of Parliament have said that they will support it to make it decisive.
Two thirds of the vote in Parliament will be required to change the name.
The state election commission stated that by 1 p.m., no wrongdoing reports had been received.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their newsletters into the urns.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," declared 62-year-old elector Giose Tanevski in the capital of Skopje.
By September 30, 2018, in Straumice, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zayev of Macedonia, his wife, Zoreka, and his son Soulko voted at the country 's dialogue on the change of name that would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
Before the Skopje Congress, 54-year-old Volodymire Cavardarkov prepared a small scene and put chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the protesters.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the service door, ” declared Kavardakov.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev believes that membership in NATO will bring many needed investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority vote in favor, since more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO, ” said Zayev after the vote.
He pointed out that the result "yes" would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters will be involved in the election, which is below the required appearance.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma television channel, 57 percent of the respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote in favor.
In order for a dispute to be declared valid, it must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat at the protest will be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its beginning last May.
Look at this: Sergei Aguero of Manchester City goes through all of Briton's defense and hits a goal.
Sirchio Aguero and Rachel Sterling fought for Briton and brought the Manchester City victory with a score of 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Hall Agüero at the 65th minute of the match looked like a ridiculous simple.
The Argentine attacker got a pass at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three of Briton's protectors and found himself in an open field.
Then Agüero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went around one defender, then he ran several more on the edge of Briton's penalty line.
And then he went to the left when he saw Sterling.
An English forward made the first touch on the penalty counter to give Aguero's ball, which, with its right boot, launched it in the right side of the gate, defeating the Briton holkepper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs," said the reporter's manager of the City of Pep Guardiola.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at this moment."
But the prime advantage of the celestial blue in this match of the Prime Minister League provided Sterling.
This goal took place at 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep in Briton's territory.
He sent a beautiful piercing pass along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few touches, and he went on to pass Sterling in the direction of the long trouser.
Forward of the celestial blues threw the ball into the gate just before he slipped outside.
The City will meet Hoffhenheim at the group stage of the League of Champions at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Reine Neckkar Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take his points to Roxis
Since the Washington Mountains team left playoff, there was no reason to wait for another start.
But rival Sherzer hopes to go to the Pitcher Mountain on Sunday in a match against the Colorado Rockies, provided that Roxies still has difficulty leaving for playoff, now Roxies is one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western League.
The Roxies have at least a Wild Card for winning the 5-2 score over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to secure the title of the first division.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to leave the ball, knowing how the spectators are acting here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level that I've seen this entire year.
Why don't I want to take part in this competition?
The Nationals will still announce who's going to be the starter on Sunday, but it's reported that they're leaning towards Sherzer.
Sherzer, for whom this is going to be the 34th start, has a pitching session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
The Washington Right has a score of 18-7 out of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 inning this season.
Trump meetings in West Virginia
The President had taken a good note of the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court, Britta Cavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the presence of Republican supporters in mid-term elections.
Everything we've done will be on the map in November.
Five weeks later, one of the most important elections in our lives will be held.
It's one of the big, big -- I don't run, but I really run, so I fight for great candidates wherever I can, ” he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it's happening now.
And they're firmly set to regain power, using any means, you see vileness, shit.
They don't care who's suffering from them, who's the one who needs to go over to gain power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is “to resist and hinder. ”
“And you've been seeing this for the last four days, ” he said, calling the Democrats “wicked and mean, disgusting and lying. ”
He referred to the Senate Court Committee, calling the senator-democratic Diane Feynstein by name, which provoked the audience to hear loud cries of discontent.
Remember her answer?
Did you give the document?
Uh-uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- this was really a bad language of the body carts -- the worst language of the body carts that I've ever seen."
The Laborist Party is no longer a broad church.
It's intolerant to those who express their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to convict me, it was hardly unexpected.
Finally, I'm the last of those laborers in Parliament to be informed that they're not happy, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated almost the same way to my Parliament because she was determined to take a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
But I was convicted for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As to the importance of responsible economic policy, as regards national security, as far as Europe is concerned, these questions are ironically similar to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report of the Nottingham East meeting on Friday says, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the evening Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the laborers were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of “more benevolent, softer ” politics has long been forgotten if it has ever been carried out.
It's becoming increasingly obvious that the Laborist Party does not allow different views, and every thought is appreciated from the position of being acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, a group with which I once thought I had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept positions that I would never agree with, whether national security or the EU’s single market.
Every time I speak in public -- and no matter what I say -- this is followed by a series of attacks on social networks with calls for withdrawal, condemnation of central politics, and I'm told that I shouldn't be in the Laborist Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckyer than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have received are usually political.
I'm thrilled with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who deal with sexual or racist attacks every day but never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse levels have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Laborist Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a large church, and with every movement of distrust or change in the rules of selection, the party narrows down.
Over the last two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been urged not to stand up, not to speak so loudly that I'm "all is well."
But that's not why I came to politics.
I joined the laborers 32 years ago as a schoolteacher, because the lack of attention on the part of the Tetcher government literally caused my high school class to collapse, and since then I've been trying to improve the quality of public service for those who need it most, whether it's a local adviser or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has bothered my political views and differences with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday's events, I just want to say one thing: in conditions where the country is going to go to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and government agencies, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
I actually have another message, but not for Notingham Times, but for my voters, both members of the Labor Party and not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of recalling me or any political advantage will prevent me from acting in harmony with what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: the invincible Air climbs up
The last two attempts may have distorted some of the outcome, but there is no doubt that Air deserves a triumph in today's beautiful entertainment match by the Prime Minister of Scotland.
Now they're in charge of the table, it's the only invincible team of ten.
After all, great defense and improved ability to take advantage of the odds gives the masters and coach Peter Merchi the full right to be content.
"We've been through our games so far, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose commented, "I give due "Air," and they took better chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Frazier Climo led Air forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, published by Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Climo stepped up the leadership of Air with a penalty, and right before the break, did and did a solo attempt that gave an account of 17-5 in favor of Air.
But Melrose had a good start at the second time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggot reduced the break to five points.
Afterward, there was a prolonged delay due to the serious trauma of Ruard Knott, who was pulled out of the field on the shelves, and the restart of Air ran forward with a attempt by Stafford McDauwell, which was carried out by Clemo.
Captain Claire McPherson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay the unrealized attempt of Bruce Colvin under intense pressure.
The hosts returned, but when Strayan Hutchinson got a yellow card for Climo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the mole "Air."
Climo tried what he did almost every time after reset, and then Kyle Rowe got from David Armstrong hit in the box and sent a flunker to Gregor Henry for the fifth try of the host team.
Looks like the Star of the "A Still Game" series set up for a new career in the restaurant realm
It looks like the Star of the "After Game" series, Ford Kieran is set up for a new career in hospitality, and this can be concluded after it is known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
This is a 56-year-old actor playing Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC television series, a script he's writing to and in which he's playing with Greg Hamfield's old comedy partner.
Duet announced that the future 9th episode would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning his life after Cragling.
According to the official record, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the Scottic Sun source suggested that Cyrnan wanted to enter the "blossom restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"Morour Ours": domestic Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol the equipped Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang an ocean-blue flag.
The sea base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is painted with the motto, "The sea is our right.
We have to return it."
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there's still a memory of the loss of the coastline, which left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century with natural resources, and there's a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is awaiting an international court ruling on October 1, after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, a positive outcome, ” commented Roberto Calsadius, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the announcement of the decision of the NYU on large screens across the country, and they hope that the court in Gaaz will take a decision in favor of Bolivia, that after decades of excruciating conversation, Chile will be forced into negotiations to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic root president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his reconversion the following year, also puts great hope in a decision that will be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if that happens, little will change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to condemn the territory of Chile and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
It is clear that the decision of the U.S.J., made only six months after the final arguments were presented, indicates that the case “was not complicated, ” told Pas Zarate, a Chilen expert on international law.
Bolivia's case has not progressed, and for the last four years, it may have contributed to the reversal.
“The request for access to the sea was used by the present Bolivian administration, ” Zaratet said.
Morales' war rhetoric blew up the remains of Chile's benevolent kindness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Valtze, Bolivia’s representative in Haiti, did not agree that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday Bolivia will get “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of Chile’s relationship and a chance to end 139 years of disagreement by mutual benefit, ” he said.
Calsadius also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the sea issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up her right of access to the Pacific, ” he added.
This decree is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says there's no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ree spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made at the Singapore summit by the leaders of the superstitious countries.
His comments appeared when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which went into the deaf corner more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chang Inn.
Rí says that belief that the continuation of the penalties and opposition to the U.S. declaration of the end of the Korean War will one day put North Korea on the knees is a “intrusive dream. ”
Washington is afraid to accept a declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps toward disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there's widespread skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously abandoning his arsenal, which the country probably thinks is the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive major detachments, which is on the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely hide from the sun, you've found what you need.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a series of eccentric master dresses in the style of the Orbitase from a spring-seven 2019 collection on the episodes of the brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers called designers have already sent their insatiable creatures beyond the range of the event.
Valentino's turned out to be an extravagant bee hat with a wide-painted feathered field that covered the heads of the models.
Among the other overlayers, they're adorned with precious coffee stones, a witch hat, and even a pineapple hat, but they're not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the original masks ’ assortment — very early before Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creature was like an underwater swim with a tube and glasses, another looked like a crack of ice cream that melted.
And if you support this serious fashionable application, you're lucky.
Stylists say huge hats can come out on the main streets of your city.
The Operase Capels came into fashion because of La Bomby, a straw hat with fields 60 centimeters wide, which was seen on all, from Rianna to Emily Ratazhkowski.
The Cult brand behind a very impractical hat, which was seen everywhere in social networks, gave peace another creation: a straw beach bag almost the size of a model in a bathing suit that carried it.
A bag of yellow-red raffany and white leather pen was the center of a collection of La Riviera spring-year-long 2019 Jacquemus brands in the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “In the coming summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the designer’s influence is so enormous that it will be hard to ignore demand for an overlay. ”
John Edward: knowledge of language is binding to citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland support high standards of learning, and in 2018 they again received excellent results from exams that complement individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SHED), want to provide the best services for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to train students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable subjects for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in the language she understands, she understands it in the mind.
If you speak to her in her native language, she feels it in her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't use English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exams, we see that in independent schools, languages are spoken in the ratings of subjects with the best grades.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages scored higher A.
Data gathered in 74 schools in the SHRS showed that 72 percent of students got a higher A in Chinese, and 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent of students in French, and 63 percent of students in Spanish also got A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now languages as a selection subject are taught the same way as NTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), as part of independent school programs, and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Job and Skills in 2014, revealed that 17% of the reasons why employers are unable to close jobs are due to a lack of language skills.
That's why language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for a future career.
Because more and more promising positions are in need of knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalizing world.
No matter what career you choose, if someone has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages the advantage over competitors.
According to a 2013 YouTube survey of over 4,000 adults in Britain, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double - sized percentage of people (15%).
That's why investing in language teaching is now important to today's children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially in the languages of developing countries, will give children more chance of finding a full - time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn its own languages.
A series of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to Britain from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, independent schools will always be able to select several languages to study with qualified teachers.
The Scottish Independent Schools are trying to create an educational environment that prepares children and armes them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for them.
Now it can't be denied that in the international business environment, languages continue to have vital importance for the future country, so it should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered “the skills of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, diversity and perfection to Scottish youths.
Il fatu been le fire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is debuting with Lakers in San Diego.
The fans who want to see the first start of Labron James for Los Angeles Lakers are almost there.
Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday on the first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll be playing, it's not decided yet.
“It's going to be more than one and less than 48, ” said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Dydell, reported that James would most likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare, ” he replied.
Trump meetings in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is opening a series of pre-electoral rallies today from Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trump rallys planned for the next week, including those in friendlyly configured states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidate he offered to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump wants to form support for future mid-term elections, because the Republicans risk losing control of Congress after voting in November.
What time is it that Trump's evening meeting in West Virginia will take place today, and how do you watch it on the Internet?
Trump's meeting in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled 19 hours in Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia online below in live air on YouTube.
Trump will probably mention the tension of the hearing this week over a candidate before the Supreme Court, Britta Cavanaugh, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the delay in the Senate vote for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans gain popularity before the election in November.
President Trump’s representatives stated that these five elections the following week were aimed at “activation of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand most of the votes they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, ” reports Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical to his day order that the president will go to as many states as possible because he is approaching the tense pre-election campaign season," said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign who refused to name his name.
At the Wesbanko Arena Stadium in Willing, today’s rally may be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, where he won over 40% of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate from the Republicans to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisy, whose ratings are down in the polls.
“ It’s not good for Morrisy that the president is coming to raise his survey rating, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a political politician at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and hopes for Sunday singles
After three sessions that ended in a one-way victory, Saturday fortresses can become exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
The swing pendulum of the impulse is a completely fictional sports concept that players really believe in, especially at such games.
So when do they say the pulse is working?
"They were six points ahead, and now they're four, so I think we're taking it a little bit like a pulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their windmills, and they're also encouraged by a lot, not last in the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who were playing together all day long, and each earns three of the four points.
Spit and his murdering blows from the bottom to the bottom show an example.
These larynx cries of the festivities became louder when, in the course of his round, he made the crucial patch and leveled the score at the fourth match after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His path, which allowed them to win a match on 15 holes, faced a similar cry, such as telling you that the American team doesn't appear.
"You really just have to try hard and worry about your own match," said Spit.
That's all each of these players left now.
18 holes to get famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days -- Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable story of Ryder Cup.
It's unusual, but a charming couple in Europe have four out of four and can't make mistakes.
Molivud was the only couple who didn't make a godga on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to avoid the godga on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This race and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this turbulent crowd makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Fleetwood or Molinari to secure the potential victory of the Europeans when the sun sets over Le Gulf National.
Both are desirable at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the triumph of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Sampson took care of Sergio Josiah, the hero of morning trouts, when he was married to Alex Norren.
One bohga and two dabs on the first nine holes led the Spaniards and the Swedes to a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to watch for the troupes and the nozzles because of the interaction between the couple's participants, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and it's interesting to see how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe is currently playing better than a team and has a great advantage on the last day, but this session of the nozzles also showed that the U.S. team is going to fight, which some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe is leading with a score of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
On the closing day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a sterling advantage, for after the Saturday for balls and nozzles, it precedes the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired duet by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have won two victories over the late Tiger Woods, and now on Le Gulf National, they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to recover the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning troupes with a 3-1 bill.
The U.S. got more resistance in the nozzles and won two matches, but they couldn't cut the break.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, and he and Mollinari are the first to win four points in a row. (The Malwood after a sensational weekend is only the second pair who scored four points in the first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fortballs, they united to defeat the swollen Woods and the American novelty Bryson Deshambo with an even more powerful 5th4.
Woods, who pulled two matches on Saturday, showed random breakthroughs of genius, but at the moment he lost 19 of his 29 matches in forbes and nozzles and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who didn't participate in morning forts, returned to Henry Stanson's fortress partner to get a 2-to-1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koppka, which is the first and third of the world's rating.
Europe couldn't do everything in its own way this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
The three main winners, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two points.
They won a decisive victory of 2th-one over the Spanish John Ram and Ian Polter in the forblets and later defeated Polter and Rory McLray with an account of 4th3 in the fores, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team returned with a four-point deficit in the singles, although Furik's team only needed nothing to save the trophy.
However, after second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it can't.
North Korea says that "no way" will not be dismantled in a one-sided manner without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister on Saturday told the UN that the extension of the authorizations deepens distrust in the United States, and that under such circumstances, the country will never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho reported at the annual UN General Assembly that last year North Korea took “unique measures of goodwill ” — such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantled nuclear testing site, and a commitment not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Well, we don't see the right response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will by no means be the first to disengage in a one-sided manner. ”
And while Ri repeated North Korea’s familiar complaints about the opposition to Washington, D.C., the “partial ” approach to deunucularization, which would reward North Korea for its progressive steps, his claim was important because it did not reject the one-sided dementification that Phenomenian had done in the past.
Ree referred to Kima Cheng In and Donald Trump's joint statement on the first ever single between the real U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on the “Korean Peninsula denuclarization” and Trump promised a security guarantee to North Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pyongyang must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to weaken the harsh international response to North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on "declaration at first" and raises the pressure by means of penalties to achieve its goal violently, even denying "the end of war," said Ree.
"To think that the punishments can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the extension of the penalties deepens our distrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader emphasized at the UN early in the week.
Instead, the Minister called attention to three meetings between Kima and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If South Korea, rather than the United States, were the party to the issue of deunucularization, the deucularization of the Korean peninsula would not have gone into such a deucluding corner. ”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech contrasted sharply with that of telling the General Assembly that the North Korean missile attack on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after the “Mr. Evil President ” Trump called Kima a“raket man ” who wanted to commit suicide.
This year at UN Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea “to the full, ” praised Kima for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that much more would have to be done and that the authorizations had to remain in force until the deunucularization of North Korea.
On Wednesday Trump observed that he did not set a time limit for this: “It will take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter. ”
China and Russia state that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. secretary Mike Pompeo announced to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council authorizations must continue energetically and unabated until we see a complete, final, confirmed deuclarization. ”
The Security Council has unanimously increased its measures against North Korea since 2006, with the objective of blocking the financing of nuclear programs and ballistic missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompeio met Ree in the United Nations General Assembly and then said that the next month he visited Pyongyang again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for “gangster demands. ”
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has promised to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes “supervisive measures”
He told us that Kima said that he needed the “correspondency measures ” as security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest
The new Harvard University course this year gave all of his students more sleep, and it's an attempt to fight the growing culture of the steepness of learning all night after the pumping of caffeine.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigam Women's Hospital, developed a course that he thinks is the first in the United States.
He decided to begin the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on his studies.
Finally, one girl approached him and said, "Why are they telling me this now, in the last year?"
“She told me that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, ” said a teacher from The Telegraph.
In the course that was first introduced this year, students are taught the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results and improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the University, explained that the university decided to introduce a course after finding that students were seriously sleepless for a week.
Clock Course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One chapter has an image of a dorm room where students click cups of coffee, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deficit on sports, and the importance of sleep-related routine.
Another chapter tells participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of a campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students instantly.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Cheasler.
The culture of pride in “sleeping all night ” still exists, he added, and also noted that modern technology and growing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is increasing.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be the student’s “secret weapon ” to deal with stress, burnout and anxiety, even a set of excess weights, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger, which causes permanent physical hunger, he explained.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaysler to develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year at Harvard during the first year.
He said that course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all aspirants to take a similar training program before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Cheasler recommends that students be reminded that they should go to bed and that they should put an alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light that are emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and that can disrupt the circadic rhythm, which causes problems with sleeping.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset Gerrard's boys
The Rangers have survived the queue of an outburst of sorrow: Dolly Menga's blow to Stephen Gerrard's distinct team, with a score of 1-0 from Livingstone.
The Iibrox team wanted to win their first victory in the race after the February triumph of St. Johnston with a score of 4-1, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard the second as manager of 18 games, and Gerrard's team remained eight points behind the Scottish Prime Minister's head of the Hurts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and Rangers, which lacked inspiration, did not seem to be able to equalize the score.
Now the Rangers are down to the sixth position, and Livingstone is up to the third position, and by the difference between the balls, only the Hibernian is ahead of them.
And the Rangers may also have another problem, because the lineman Kalum Spence has had to process the head wound after he was thrown into the guest sector by an object.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that once passed the "Air" in the halffinal Scots League Cup.
And Holt released the same Levy 11 warehouse that took one point at the Harts last week, and he was thrilled by the way his inflated boys put the opponents down at every point.
The Rangers may have dominated the power of the ball, but Livingstone worked more with the ball they got.
They were to kill in just two minutes of the game, when Menga's first pass into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit Allan McGregor's gates, but the Half Protector squandered this great chance by sending a ball across the gate.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free shot hit Skipper Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithow hit his back pants.
The Rangers did get control, but in the last third, there was more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should be entitled to a pension on the mark of a quarter of an hour after the collision with Stephen Lawless, but Professor Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers succeeded in only two hits on the gate at the first time, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, hit the head of Lassana Kulibali and the calm strike of Oviet Ejariah did little to disturb.
And even though the 34-minute overpass of Livingstone may have contradicted the pace of the game, no one can deny that they only deserved it by their hard work.
The Rangers were unable to handle Jacobs' cooking again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Menga for a simple ending.
In the break, Gerrard replaced the Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the vortex got to Morelos, but astonishing Kelly jumped off his line to block it.
However, Livingstone continued to force guests to play exactly the kind of game they liked when Lithow and Hulkett make one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved the outcome in the last stages, but McGregor was pretty good with Jacobs before Lithow hit the corner.
Glenn Middleton, replaced with the Rangers, made another late application for a fine when he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
The almanac: the inventor of Geiger's mathematician
And now the page from our Almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on that day, and the time is coming... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since that time, I've been able to think about Geiger as one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example, in 1950's "Dial Coronado" film with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play questionable cowboy-scientific cowboys.
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's counter, which is used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the effect on the radioactive atoms in minerals."
Wow, it's really cracking right now.

The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method is to remove immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory
And then these cells are able to see proteins, which are common to many cancers, and then these cells are injecting the patient again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for over 18 months.
The method includes removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can “see ” common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and continuing to reintroduce these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski of the United States National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Maryland, observed: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine. ”
“HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, ” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, ” he explained.
The same approach, which involves removing immune cells from patients and “teaching ” them to target cancer cells, has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
After he appeared in the studio on a SNL show in a MAGA baseball game, Canier West dulled with a sharp speech to support President Trump,
What caused the viewers to react negatively
The spectators at the SNL studio learned Kanier after his sad performance, in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he was going to run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Tower in a baseball cap labeled "Return America's Former Glory," he exploded with a tirade in which he criticized the Democrats, and again claimed his support for Trump.
"Sometimes while talking, white people ask me, "How can you like Trump?
Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd be leaving America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began with Matt Damon's sketch, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Britta Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Juridical Committee in the case of Christine Blazey Ford's sexual violence suit.
Although West's speech was not broadcast in direct air, the video with his tirade appeared on the social network by Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting this post.
West also complained to the viewers that there was an unpleasant situation with him behind the barbecue because of the headdress.
West said, "When I was out there, I was treated harshly.
They said to me, "Don't go to the viewers with this baseball cap."
They've been messing with me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
"Do you want to see the place where the oppressed are silent?" "I'm going to wear my superman cap because nobody can tell me what to do." "You want the world to keep moving forward?"
Then try to treat each other with love."
At least twice his comments caused the negative reaction of the audience in the audience, and the actors in the SNL show looked confused, and one of the viewers said, "The studio was dominated by dead silence."
Westa was invited at the last minute to replace a singer named Arian Grande whose former boyfriend, Raper McMiller, died a few days before the air.
The West caused many surprises by performing a song I Love it (I love it) in a water bottle suit called Perrier.
Westa was supported by the head of the conservative organization Tsuza Kendez Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the smartest:
Instead, the conductor of the talk show, Karen Gunther, wrote on Twitter that West "is who he is, and that's just great."
I don't want to reward him (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who I think is practicing and exposing the ideology that hurts my community.
He is free man.
She added.
Before the show reper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, he was now "the one who was once known as the West Canyon."
The West isn't the first artist to change his name, he's following the example of Grandpa, also known as Puff Deady, Puffy, and Pip Grandpa.
The Collega-Reper Snoop Dogg used to be called Snoop Lyon, and as we know, the musical legend of the last decades of Prince has changed his name to a symbol, and then became "The Artist formerly known as Prince."
The charge of attempted murder after assault with a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported an incident at Belligecamor restaurant.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates on Monday.
The charges will be investigated.
The Star of the Grey of Thrones, Keith Gerington, condemns the idealization of brutality.
Keith Heerington became famous for the role of a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series "The Grave of thrones" produced by HBO.
However, a 31-year-old actor who denounces the stereotype of a hero-macho, arguing that because of such heroes, young boys often feel that they have to become cool enough to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kite, he said that he thought "something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in an age of popular hashtag #MeTo (#yourself, #land, etc.).
Cate, who recently married his coworker in the Game of the Thrones, a 31-year-old actress named Rose Lesley, noted that he's "ready determined" to fight this problem.
"I'm now pretty determined when we're on the slippery path of idealizing brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach prospective men if we look at their adulthood in the face of the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for promoting brutality through images of extremely courageous heroes.
He continued, "What is natural, and what are we planted?
Why does TV and street teach young boys that they feel pressured to be men like that?
I think today's really important question is, "How can we change this?"
'Cause it's obvious that young guys are off the right track."
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any picquells and sicwells of "The Hearts of the thrones" after the show was completed next summer, because "he's done with the battles and the horses."
In November, Keith will play the real West song of Sam Shepard, the story of the movie producer and his brother- robber.
As an actor recently admitted, he thinks that meeting his wife, Rose, is the best he's ever received from a series called Game of thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life," said Keith.
In a fantasy series that won the Emmy prize, Rose played Game, the love of Heurington John Snow's hero.
The couple were married in June 2018, and the ceremony was held in Lesley's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/ AIDS: China reported a sharp increase of 14% in new cases of disease
China reported a sharp increase of 14% in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
▪ According to health authorities, there are more than 820,000 patients in the country as a whole.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases the disease was transmitted through sex, which indicates a change in the previous trend.
For a long time, in some parts of China, HlV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions.
Yet, according to official health authorities at a conference held in the province of Yunnan, the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The temporary sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminating of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT society often suffers from discrimination.
According to studies, between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men continue to marry women because of the prevailing conservative values in the country.
The transmission of the disease in most cases is due to misuse of sexual assault protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HlV drugs, seeing as a partial solution to the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the pouring of data from the Republican senators into the network of her regular employee and criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denounced verbal claims that one of her regular employees had placed the personal data of three U.S. press senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The democracy of Los Angeles claims that these statements promote ultraright political viewers and websites.
Says Waters on Twitter.
Reportedly, published information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Linda Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday, and they were placed by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing before the Senate Commission on charges of sexual misconduct committed against Britta Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of judge of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Data leaked some time after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
The Hill reported that conservative web sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, had information that the IP address of the source source was linked to the Waters office and was able to locate data from its regular collaborator.
"These baseless claims are absolutely untrue, they don't match reality," continued Waters.
"The coworker of my office whose personal data and security are threatened by these phony and false claims has nothing to do with the source of this information.
These baseless claims are absolutely false, they are not true."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the network, and a former White House press secretary, Ari Fleiser, was expressed among others.
"This denial is filled with anger," wrote Fluiser.
"It suggests that with that character she cannot be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, you don't have to get angry.
The accused should not be presumptuous.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and undisturbed."
It seems that Fleisher was conducting parallels between Waters' reaction and the criticism of the Democrats at the address of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party who is running to take Waters' seat after the results of the inter-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"That's the news, if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had already reported these false claims to the relevant state and law enforcement authorities.
"We're going to do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they answered the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of the film "Agent Johnny English: The New Mission" -- a pass-by parody for spy combaters with Rowen Atkinson.
It's already a good tradition to look in every new British film for the thought of Brexit, and there's a new part of a series of comedy jokes about Johnny Inglish, and the first film, "Johnny Inglish," came out in 2003, and later it was reinstated in 2011, discarding "Johnny Inglish: Restarting."
Will the ridiculously ironic self-satisfying of who we are, the new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny Ingleish, with his moving face and glutted eyes, was once again able to make a mess, and his name more than anything else indicates that this comic character was designed for viewers in non-speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is a wildly funny secret agent, in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, is a little bit from inspector Clouseau, a little bit from Mr. Bean, and a lot of things from the guy who played one note of the melody from the "Fire chariots" movie at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The character's foreshadowed is also a traveler and a puzzle of an international scale that has always left behind a mess that Atkinson played in a long-forgotten television ad by Barclaycard.
In the last film about Johnny Ingleish, there are a few good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Ingleish in the knight's gear was approaching the helicopter, and the spades of the screw were on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent is beautifully exposed in the film to set up a bouphonade, but humor is passing, and in some respects too much, especially when compared to "serious" movies like "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible," one of the "ingredients" of which is also a comedy.
It seems to me that jokes are more designed for children than adults, and I do not seem as ingenious and thoughtful as the Atkinson dots in the silent movies about Bean.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
A hacker enters the British super secret spy network and uncovers the names of all field agents, which is a complete surprise to an active agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episode in the movie).
It turned out to be the last corner of the prime minister, a haughty person who has already experienced destructive criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity. ( Emma Thompson tried to convey the image of Teresa May, but the script did not fully reveal it.)
The intelligence counselors have informed her that all active agents are compromised, and she needs to involve one of the retired.
Choosing falls on the awkward Johnny Inglisha, who is now a teacher at some super complex institution and who is not officially teaching children fast-forwards under cover (in this part with the spy's year school) Inglisha was a few good jokes for teenagers.
Ingleish is quickly shipped to Whitehol for emergency buffing, where he meets again with his long-suffering friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller.
The Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of an exalted, annoying person does not exactly match the talent of Vicky Pepperdin).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty goes sober, Batman and Robin are back in action and suddenly meet the deadly woman Ophelia Pistoletov, who is played by Olga Curileenko.
And at this time, the prime minister is under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who earned his wealth in technology and technology and claims he can fix the problem with the British network, the evil Jason Volt played by Jake Lacey.
Inglis and Baf go on a journey and re-enter their ridiculous pleasures: they fire in a fancy French restaurant dressed by waiters; then they sow chaos by going abroad on Volta's luxury yacht; Inglis put a real mess when trying to use the virtual reality helmet to learn how to plan Volta's house.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but with their kindness and furiousness, it's like a movie for children.
It's a walk film.
And like watching other movies about Johnny Ingleish, I asked myself the same question: Can't the British movie industry offer Rowen Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Laborists deny a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they'll get a salary in five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Laborist Party has to discuss a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but they'll be paid in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to require company leaders to transfer funds saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence to employees, giving them extra time off.
In this way, the workers will have a three-day weekend and bring home the same salary.
It's reported by sources that this idea will fit the Party's economic program and direct the country's resources to support the labor class.
The move to a four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of the Third Union, and it is hoped that this will enable workers to benefit from changing the economic situation.
The source of the Laborist Party reported to The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week fits the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interest of the workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Laborists were not the first to endorse this idea, because the Green Party had promised to set up a four-day working week during the pre-election campaign in 1951.
However, not all members of the Laborist Party currently endorse such a desire.
The Speaker of the Laborist Party stated, "The Party's political program does not include a four-day working week, so now we're not considering this idea."
John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist economic revolution at the pre-election meeting of the Laborist Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell claimed that he had set up to take back power from the "faceless directors" of the communal businesses and the "trepreneurs."
The Chancellor's Shadow Plan also means that water companies' sharers may not get all of their equity if the labor government implements "counting" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed the intention to include workers in company management and to create an inclusive share fund to pass 10% of the usual shares of private sector firms to workers who are expected to divide each year up to 500 pounds [500 pounds] of sterling.
Linda Gray and John Kennedy tell on the 60 Minutes (60 minutes) show, or can the Cavanaugh investigation, which leads the FBI, change their opinion
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Britta Cavanaugh, who leads the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a Supreme Court judge has been postponed for at least a week, and the question arises as to whether the press senators will continue and continue to support Cavanaugh after the results of the investigations of the Bureau have been published.
On Sunday 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the audience senators John Kennedy and Linda Graham if the FBI could find something to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him I had a conversation with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you really do it?"
He was determined, steadfast, uncompromising."
Seems like Graham's mind won't change anything.
"I think the charges against Cavanaugh are provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly objected," added Graham, addressing Christine Blazey Ford.
And everyone she calls can't confirm that under oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what can it do to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday, New York will receive the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the music world with a staggering number of star artists and a equally dramatic mission to fight global poverty.
At the seventh festival of the Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be mobing in the Grand Gallery of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to draw attention to the true purpose of the festival – the organizers want to overcome the extreme form of poverty by the year 1930.
The Global Citizen Festival Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global People Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors have to do a series of tasks or "acts," like taking a tutor in a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or whatever else to help draw attention to the organization's goal of putting an end to poverty.
So, are there any results, because the organizers of the Global Citizen have 12 years left to reach the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding the act with a free concert -- a genius way to convince people to demand action, is it just another case of what's called "clickivism" when people feel that something is really being changed by signing an electronic petition or by doing Twitter?
Since 2011, according to the Global Citizen, they have detected 19 million "works" of their adherents to achieve different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to declare planned financial additions and programs of more than $37 billion, which will help to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by the year 1930.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 financial obligations and public statements as an example of the results of its activities, at least 10 billion of which have already been collected and spent.
It is estimated that some 649 million people around the world have been directly affected by the funds already provided by the group.
Among the major financial obligations are the Foundation The Power of Nutrition, which is territorially related to Britain, and in the framework of the project, investors and developers have committed themselves to helping children grow up and have promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help cope with the problem of malnutrition after they have received more than 4,600 Twitter messages from the Global Citizens.
"For the support of the British government, meccanants, governments of other countries and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition an insignificant fact of history," said the representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman, speaking to the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 “acts ” that called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced a funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which aims to improve the feeding of 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?"
The representatives of the Global Citizen wrote, "This is a long and difficult journey, so sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the civil rights movement and against apartheid to us, we're going to succeed because together we're stronger."
Janet Jackson, band The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Giannell Mona, is just part of the star artists who will perform this year at the New York festival and weigh Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The Minister of Internal Affairs stated that the U.S. could use naval forces for the "blocks" to prevent the export of Russian energy.
According to the U.S. Minister of Internal Affairs Ryan Zenke, quoted in Washington Examiner, Washington can "as necessary" seek the help of the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East.
Zenke claimed that Russia's involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it is acting on an invitation to a legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy sources.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to mediate in the energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"The U.S. Navy can provide free passage through sea routes and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zenke addressed the parties to the event, which was conducted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that holds itself as the "voice of each consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare the approach to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy effectively and replace it with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "one-sided," because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While these claims were heard, Trump's administration set out to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by evading the Russian energy market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To this end, Trump officials and President Donald Trump themselves are trying to persuade the German government to abandon the "incomprehensible" project to build the North Stream 2 route, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that the North Stream 2 gas, which costs 11 billion dollars and doubles the capacity of existing gas monoxide to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of dishonest competition.
"In my opinion, we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that the consumer should be able to select suppliers," stated Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak after meeting U.S. energy minister Rick Perry, which took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked a negative reaction by Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization of the Federal Union of the German Industry (BDI) has urged the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and the two-way agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempff, head of the Federal Union of German Industry, after the last German chancellor, Angela Merchel, met Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren's going to think seriously about the 2020 presidential race.
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that he would think seriously about running for president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting with the public in Golliok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of presenting her candidacy.
According to The Hill Warren, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington, D.C., and set up the government, and there must be a woman in his head."
"Before November 6, I'm going to think seriously about making my candidacy for President."
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her appreciation for the presidentship of Donald Trump, stating that he's going to lead his country in the wrong direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open-minded, criticizing Trump and his candidate for the position of Supreme Court Judge, Britta Cavanaugh.
In a Friday Twitter, Warren wrote: "...unquestionably, the FBI has to investigate before the vote."
Yet, according to a poll published on Friday, most of Warren’s voters do not believe that it should run in 2020.
In line with a survey conducted by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts expressed their opposition to the senator's proposal.
Thirty-two percent supported the decision.
The survey revealed that more support was being received by former Governor Dewal Patrick, and 38% was expressed for his potential presidentship, against 48%.
During the discussion of the candidates for other prominent democracy that can run in 2020, they also call the former vice president Joe Byden and the senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Baiden stated that he would make the decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD in a campaign to support Donald Trump.
26-year-old Trac Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son's going through now, what he's going through after his return, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are coming home with," she said before the rally to support Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called Trac's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "went home the wrong way they used to be, the cruelest, and wanted to know if they respected what their soldiers, pilots and other military officers had done for this country."
According to the spokesman for the police department of Vasilla, Dan Bennett, Trac was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as with preventing a report of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol abuse.
-- 18 states and the district of Colombia support asylum policy complaints
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia support a complaint of a new U.S. policy that denies refugee status to victims of gang persecution and domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and circuits sent an analytic note to the Washington court councillor to support the client who needs asylum and has denounced the policy.
The full name of the lender in Grace v. Cechns under the American Civil Rights Union, which denounces federal policy and which was presented in August, is not open.
The client claimed that her partner "and his cruel son-bandits" beat her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally held in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace's lawsuits stated that the inhabitants of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (who often seek asylum in the United States) often face serious problems such as gang violence and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status reverses the decision of the Migration Appeals Board in 2014, that immigrants without documents who fled from domestic violence could ask for asylum.
General Karl Reysin, the attorney general of the district of Colombia, stated on his Friday talk that the new policy “neglects decades of state, federal and international law. ”
“Federal law requires that the decision on the application for refugee status be based on a review of the facts and circumstances presented in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle, ” is presented in an analytic note by a judge of the court.
The prosecutor's analysis further points out that the policy that bans immigrants from entering the United States harms the economy because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill the necessary labor resources."
In June, attorney general Jeff Ceshns issued an order for immigration judges stating that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is given to persons who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial belonging, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," stated Ceshnes at the presentation of politics on June 11.
The purpose of asylum was never to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
The rescuers desperately seek out survivors, while the death toll in Pala has doubled
For those who are alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with fever in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palou.
"Every minute the ambulance brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water."
Some people go back to their devastated homes, take over their flooded goods, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals are overcrowded by an earthquake with an earthquake of 7.5 points on Richter's scale.
Some of the wounded, including two of the wounded, two of whom have broken their back and shoulder, rest at the Pala Army Hospital building, where patients are being cared for in the open air through constant repeated pushes.
His eyes were filled with tears when he remembered the strong push that hit the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I've been crammed in the debris of the wall," told Geris to correspondent Associated Press, adding that he and his family came to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife beg for help, and then calmed down.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "executing psychological pressure" with the "advertising that contains propaganda."
A week after the Chinese national newspaper placed on four pages of the American daily publication advertising material on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump of the past Wednesday referred to a pay supplement to China Daily in Des Mountains Register – the most popular newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to influence elections to Congress on November 6, China rejects these accusations.
According to Reuters, official officials in the United States reported that Trump's claims that he accused Beijing of trying to intervene in American elections mean a new phase of escalation from Washington, D.C., whose goal is to pressure China.
While foreign governments can post commercial advertisements to activate trade, there is a trade war escalation between Beijing and Washington, D.C., in which they have already increased import taxes.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the establishment of a repressive customs officer in China was intended to strike exporters from such states as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa state governor, the largest agricultural exporter to China, claimed that China had harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brunstead wrote in a column on the Sunday release of Des Mountains Register, "energizes pressure by publishing propaganda ads in our independent press."
"To promote propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, posting a paid advertising ad in Des Mountains Register," wrote Brunstead.
In contrast, in the street layouts here in Beijing, you're only looking for individual voices of disassociating, and here you're not going to see the true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is disturbing, which leads to the conclusion that Chinese media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party,," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the respectful Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts warn that the failure of Cavanauauau from Cavanauauauau by Republicans set up women voters against themselves before the intermediate elections.
Since many prominent Republicans support and protect the candidate for the position of Justice of the Supreme Court, Britta Cavanaugh, after he has been accused of having sexual harassment, analysts warn that this could trigger an undesirable reaction on the eve of future intermediate elections, especially in women.
There's passion around this situation, and most Republicans publicly state that they want to go to the vote.
These things can't be played back later," stated in an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday, by Grant Richter, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University School.
Rieger doubted that the FBI investigation, which at the last moment had been pressed by senator Jeff Flake (resister from Arizona), would be enough to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., chief adviser and spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group, Catherine Jean-Perryer said on Friday, "The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning the protesters sang "The Face Is Coming" at a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when the Republics decided to move on to confirmation of Cavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blazey Ford's testimony.
In an interview with the news website of Stew Rotenberg, an outside political columnist, he said, "People will be extremely interested and interested."
"They say it is now, and it's true.
However, motivation may increase, especially in 18 to 29-year-old women in the vote, with no definition and often no vote, if they dislike the president."
Even before Ford gave a testimony in connection with the charges of a candidate for a Supreme Court judge for a sexual offense, analysts predicted a negative reaction by the voters if the Republics insisted on confirmation.
Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, said earlier this week, "This is a unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
Gaius Cecil, "it's not about voting a committee, voting a final vote, or Cavanaugh was on the stand of the defendant, but how they reacted to this situation and how they went on."
Yet, Americans' thoughts about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, are divided, and a little more support is given by Ford.
According to a new YouTube poll, 41 percent of the respondents believe or rather believe in Ford's testimony, while Cavanaugh's testimony either believes or more likely believes 35% of those interviewed.
In addition, 38 percent of those surveyed reported that they thought Cavanaugh was giving or was likely giving false testimony, whereas 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after his insistence, the FBI is checking the charges against Ford and another lender, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week Ford testified under oath to the Senate Juridical Committee about Cavanaugh's attack on her while under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez stated that the candidate for the position of judge of the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at a party while they were at the Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world Internet is planning to launch a "new Internet" to create a Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the global Internet, launches a new startup to create a Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
The latest technology legend project, the Inrupt company, is developing a platform with Open Source Solid, an idea that belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and to whom to access information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, the Inrupt goal was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
This is a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create a "personal online data store" or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists of current affairs, calendar, audio library, and other tools for personal use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify at the same time in the same browser.
The unique feature of this personal online data store is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities with data."
According to Inrupt General John Bruce, the company aims to activate resources, processes and skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several state developers hired to work on the project, and a volunteer programming community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own offline applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee claimed that he and his team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete replacement when all their business models undergo radical changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Media Burners-Lee, Inrupt's mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate about online neutrality.
Even at the launch of the Inrupt Berners-Lee, he remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm looking very optimistic at the next age of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the dedication of the Church's representative to the Order of the Cross Victoria during World War I
The only representative of the Church of England who received the Order of the Crus Victoria for fighting during World War I is venerated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was rewarded for taking part in the Battle of Belnglis and Leocourt on September 29, 1918.
But he was killed by a sniper bullet four days later and never found out that he had received Britain's highest military reward.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vanne, called "very symbolic" that the discovery of the monumental stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vanne transferred his battalion across St. Katen's Channel "through a very dense fog and under a dense fire of field cannons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the firefront and, with "sudden bravery," led the force forward, before one broke into the cannon of the field and destroyed three cannons of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918 -- a little over a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vanne said that his grandfather did something he could never repeat himself and that he deserved to be respected.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vanne, laid a crown after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vanne said, "I feel very proud to participate in this parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the respect that so many people show him."
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they were shown Peppu's Pig.
Imagine you're not sleeping all night just to watch the event of Bellator 206 and you're denied the opportunity to view the main event.
There were 13 battles in the San José tournaments, including six major program champions that were broadcast live at night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., just before Hegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to get together in a fight, the British TV viewers were surprised when Peppa's pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the battle.
Some spectators weren't thrilled because they didn't sleep till the morning, waiting for the fight.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a childhood cartoon seemed to him "some kind of bad joke."
"According to the government's decree of content, which was broadcast at 6: 00 a.m., it was inappropriate, so they had to release a child broadcast," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications with Bellator when asked for a television broadcast,
- "Peppa Pig Pig," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, has promised to work on a schedule of broadcasts to cover future audiences in Britain.
"I think that if we talk about repeating the broadcast, we can do it," said Coker.
"I'm sorry, it's Sunday, 6:00 a.m., and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages we responded to, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it turned out that this was a mismatch with government regulations.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to shorten the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we've tried to redirect the fan signal, but we've stopped these attempts for now.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Tom Daley felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper Tom Daily tells us that he was growing up, feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete claimed that he didn't understand that "not all look like him" until he went to high school.
By participating in the Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he pointed out that he openly spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also claimed that because of his fatherhood, he became less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The conductor, who's been running this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for months.
When he came as a couple on Laverne's first program, Daily said that he felt worse than others in childhood, because "sociality doesn't take it when someone likes boys and girls."
He said, "To this time, the sense of inferiority and difference was exactly what gave me the strength and the power to succeed."
According to him, he wanted to prove that something was "watchman" so as not to disappoint everyone who finally learned about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic preser became a famous LBHT community rights fighter and took advantage of the appearance at this year's Association Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He claimed to speak openly about his views because he was happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and he wanted to give this hope to others.
The three-time champion of the world admitted that his feelings for the man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 were a real surprise to him.
Daily married Oscar's winner, 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so many things at such a young age" (at the first Olympics, he performed at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also survive a similar fall and fall.
In June the couple had a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and since then, according to Daily, his "worldliness" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I'd only think about getting gold," he said.
"You know, there are things far more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robby."
His son was named his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said that his father couldn't accept the idea of the end, and before he died, he asked if they had bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, "You can't sit in the front row because you won't be around anymore," said Daley.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he said.
The next year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and gained bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that," said Daily.
It also inspired him to choose his first song - Proud (Horde) in the performance of Gizer Small – which resonated with him in preparation for the Olympics and still summons ants.
The Desert Island Discs program is released to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m. in English summertime.
On Saturday from the tournament match for the Ryder Cup, Michaelson, who was not in shape.
U.S. Phil Miquellson made a record on Sunday, playing his 47th tournament for "The Ryder Cup," but he has to restore the form so that this event doesn't make him unhappy.
Michaelson, who's a record 12th time in a tournament that takes place once every two years, took Captain Jim Furick out of the game at the time of the for balls and forts.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-time winner spent the whole day encouraging the team and practicing on the side, hoping to control his emotions.
Because Michelson was not famous for the fine blows even while he was in the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete was not exactly suitable for a difficult golf course, Le Gold National, where a raft usually punishes wandering strokes.
And if the field is not a big obstacle, the ninth match on Sunday, Michaelson, will have to meet the Open Champion and the exact shot wizard Francesco Molinari, who won all his games this week with newer Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans who are three points behind after 12 single matches start well, the Michelson match can be decisive.
Furic expressed confidence in his athlete, and he probably had nothing else to add.
"He fully understood his role today, rolled me on my back, hugged me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He has no doubt about his powers.
Michaelson is a member of the Hall of Fame who did so much for the teams last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't expect him to play two games.
I've been predicting more matches, but that's how it worked out, and so we decided to do that.
He wants to be there in the field like anyone else."
If Michelson leaves the field on Saturday, he'll beat Nick Faldo's record, who played the largest number of games in the Ryder Cup tournament.
He may be able to complete his career in the "Ryder Cup" tournament, which never matched his individual achievement.
At Michelson's 18 victories, 20 defeats, and 7 no results, but Furik said that his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
"He's funny, he's hungry, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny with others, he's a guy who's cool to have on the team," explained Furik.
"I think the younger players had fun riding on him, and this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big break doesn't solve anything
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a remarkably lone-played match on the last day of the Ryder Cup tournament has not guaranteed a victory yet.
Dutchanine debuted in 1997 in a game at the Walderram Club, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros took the Americans five points ahead, but won the match with a slight break with a result of 41⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in a game at the Walderram field; a big break in Brookline where we lost, and in the Walderram field where we were raped," said Bjorn after watching Class 2018 victorious games with the result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at Le Gold National Stadium, followed by a break of 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has been solved yet.
Tomorrow we have to play with maximum return.
You can go out to the field and do whatever you need.
The game will only end when the result appears on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we know very well who's opposing us, the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a complicated field, Bjorn added, "I'll never run in advance.
Tomorrow things might be different.
Tomorrow we're expected to have a personal match, and that's something else.
It's cool to play field with your partner when things go well, but it's when you stand there alone, and you can check what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to configure players to perform tomorrow: at the limit of opportunity.
You leave your partner with no support, and now he also has to show you what he can do."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number, Jim Furick, expects his partners to play a better game on a personal level, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Up to Furic's very last day, fate came back by different sides: he was among the winners in Brookline, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created the Miracle in Medin.
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, organized players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we need to get started successfully, like it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone else's side, players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We put the players in the team, as if we were going to, like, do something incredible tomorrow."
Tomas is commissioned to try to lead the counter-attack at the top-match against Rory McGillroy, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Polter are on the first half of the list of European teams.
"It's these partners and in that order I chose because I want to share the effort equally throughout the whole game," Bjorn commented on his choice of players at the individual games.
The entry into action of the new German warship was put off again
However, according to local media, this will not happen until at least the next year because of broken systems and a rapid increase in spending.
According to Die Zeit newspaper, received from a spokesman for military knowledge, the entry into operation of the Rhineland-Palatz, the main ship of a series of modern frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
This ship was due to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery affected the ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, have to replace the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of antiair and anti-ship missiles, and some technologies to reduce awareness, including radar, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of maintenance, and it is expected that new frigates will be able to avoid returning to the base port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit warns that because of the ongoing delay, the supermodern warships that were to increase the military power of Germany at sea will become obsolete at the time of the invasion.
F125 was hit in the headlines of the Toric newspaper when German naval forces officially refused to take the vessel into action and returned it to Blohm + Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a naval ship returned after delivery.
Although little is known about the reasons for the return, German media mentioned significant “deficits of software and equipment ” that made the warship unfit for military operations.
Inadequacies in software are especially important because the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class of about 120 sailors is only half the number of soldiers who served on the old Bremen frigates.
It also found that the vessel had a considerable surplus of weight, which made its exploitative characteristics worse and limited the possibility for further upgrade.
The Rhineland-Paltz frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7000 tons) for ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to poor equipment, another problem has been the aggregate cost of the project, which also includes the cost of preparing the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros were converted into a colossal 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion).
The problems of getting new frigates have gained special weight in the light of recent warnings about the decline of German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, authorized by Hans-Peter Bartels, reported that the U.S. Navy had “a limited number of ships capable of carrying out combat. ”
The official stated that the situation had deteriorated rapidly for a time, since old ships had been out of use and no new ones had arrived.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to recapture the navy.
The National Trust will watch the bat's secret life
A new survey of landowners in Scotland’s hills aims to determine how bats use the landscape to find food.
Scientists hope that the data received will help to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take future measures to preserve them.
In the gardens of Invera in Wester Ross, scientists of the Scottish National Trust will observe species such as dwarf neopy and pygmie neopy, as well as the ears of a normal and watery night.
Special registrars will be placed in strategic locations in the land area to observe bat behavior during the season.
Workers and volunteers of the Scottish National Trust will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and ownership of bat screams.
Then plans to develop a detailed animal life map and prepare a report to link animal behavior to the environment.
Rob Duard, the National Cost Resource for the Protection of Nature in Scotland, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of conservation measures (such as meadowing) and to determine the best ways to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the past century, bat populations have greatly decreased in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened with the active construction and development of areas that rob them of their nesting sites.
Other negative factors include wind stations and lighting, fly sticky paper, chemical processing of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The boulders aren't actually blind.
But by hunting at night, their ears are more effective in helping them catch prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated sonar techniques to detect insects and interference in flight paths.
In the National Spending of Scotland, which handles over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, bats are taken seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, site checks, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, which is in the area of Trev's site in Dumfress and Galloway, where eight of the ten bat species that live in Scotland were found.
Manager David Thompson says it's an ideal place for them.
"In the space area I've had wonderful conditions for bats," he assures me.
"There are old buildings, lots of giant trees, and other favorable living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot more about bats, and with the research we do here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to thrive."
It insists that it is very important to test the territory for bats before any technical work is done, because the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for youngsters can kill up to 400 females with babies, which is likely to destroy the entire local population.
It is forbidden to kill, torture, or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Center for Bat Conservation, urged the public to join the organization.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats.
Ronald rejects the charge of rape, and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German edition
Cristian Ronald called the charge of rape "Nacklepe" and claimed that people were "trying to attract attention," using his name.
His lawyers are willing to file a lawsuit against the German newsmagazine Der Spigel, which published suspect information.
An American woman named Kathryn Majorga accused the forward of the Portuguese Congregation and the Yuventus soccer club of rape, which happened in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to a report in Der Spigel magazine on Friday, Ronald allegedly paid her $375,000 for silence.
A few hours after the charges were made, 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to 142 million of his fans on a video broadcast to Instagram, calling the corresponding messages "scroll."
"No, no, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander," this was the statement made on camera by the five-time leader of the Golden Ball.
They want to attract attention using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to profit from me, but similar situations are part of my job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," added a football player, smiling.
According to the Reuters news agency, Ronald's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegelle for published charges, which they called an "unacceptable report of suspicion in private life."
The lawyer Christian Shertz stated that a football player would demand compensation for "moral damage in size which corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most common cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after meeting Ronald and Majorga at the nightclub, they returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, and this testimony was passed to the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident described, Ronald fell to his knees and said he was a 99 percent good guy, who was a 1 percent bad guy.
Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with a model, but by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to a prison policy because she was afraid of revenge and wasware of "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous deal because she's still suffering from an incident that she says happened.
At the time of the scheduled Ronald incident, he was preparing to go to FC Real Madrid with the Manchester U.S. FC, and this summer he became the player of the Grand Italian soccer team, the Yuventus team, for 100 million euros.
Great Britain will “forever regret ” the loss of auto manufacturers
Britain's "long-term regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in auto processing after Brexit.
He added that he was excited by a statement by Toyota UK representatives who told BBC journalists that in the case of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, the company would be forced to suspend the production and operation of its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," assures Secretary Clark.
The Japanese auto manufacturer stated that the effects of the delay on the border in the case of Brexit without a contract could cost jobs.
The Bernaston factory, which produces Toyota Models Auris and Avensis cars, released about 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain exits the EU sharply at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, director general of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other auto manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain’s withdrawal from the EU will affect the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU without an international trade agreement.
For example, BMW said that the Mini Model factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of auto manufacturers are that Brexit without a contract can pose a risk to supply chains.
Toyota's production line functions in rapid delivery mode of parts and materials according to the needs -- details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for automobiles made on demand.
If, on March 29, Britain leaves the EU without a treaty, there may be confusion on the border, which will cause delay and lack of materials.
In Toyota's warehouse, it's said, you can place the details at least for one day, so the production will have to be stopped.
Greg Clark pointed out that the EU's plan for relations with Theresa May (Chequesers Plan) "is specifically designed to avoid problems on the border."
"We need a deal, and we need to make an optimal deal that I think will enable not only to succeed at the moment but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the Today program in radio station BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota representatives and other auto manufacturers, we need to preserve well-formed high-performing supply chains."
The Toyota company was unable to report how long the production would be stopped, but in the long run, it is expected that higher costs will reduce the company’s ability to compete and, as a result, make jobs shrink.
Peter Tswalaris, head of the U.S. trade union orgy at a factory in Bernaston, who worked here for 24 years, reported that other participants are extremely concerned, "I can tell from experience that short jobs are not being restored."
The representative of the government said, "We have made an accurate and reliable plan to shape our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's and Rosenstein's meeting can be delayed again, assigned to White House
As reported by White House representatives on Sunday, the responsible meeting of Donald Trump with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "defer for another week" while the debate continues about Britt Cavanaugh's candidacy as Judge of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's involvement in elections, relations between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential interference with justice on the part of the president.
Within a few months in Washington, D.C., they're discussing the possibility of a deputy attorney general being released, which would endanger Muller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had commented on the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of terminating the President's 25th correction.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House on the background of reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump claimed that "didn't want to" release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coincidence with the Senate Juridical Committee meeting where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, were to testify to.
On Friday Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the charges against Cavanaugh, which added to the vote in the Senate.
Pres Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, performed on Fox News Sunday television show.
She said to the question about a meeting with Rosenstein, "The date of the meeting is not due, maybe this week, and I expect her to be suspended for another week, in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I keep watching the press have the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not hold a mailing call for media in White House since September 10.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the infrequent conduct of the brifings was not associated with the unkindness of public games by TV reporters, although she added, "I can't deny that they're playing public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
"The president answers questions more often than any president to him," she said and added, without referring to the source, "Statistic speaks for itself."
Sanders pointed out that brigging is still going to happen, but "if the press has a chance to ask the U.S. president a question, it's better than talking to me."
We've been trying to communicate with the press a lot, and this should have been particularly noticeable in the last few weeks, and the possibility of talking to the U.S. president is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when outside the White House, open meeting, or press conferences for high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York City this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case by speaking to the journalists in a way that's indistinct and sometimes bizarre.
The State Secretary of Health of Scotland addressed a letter to EU employees in connection with fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has sent a letter to citizens of other EU countries working in the National Health Service of Scotland to express their appreciation for their work and to ask them to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for permanent migration for EU citizens who work in autonomous public services.
In her letter to Mrs. Freeman, she said, "For the past summer, the negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of exit have continued, and this fall should be followed by appropriate decisions.
But the U.K. government is intensifying preparations for a possible exit without a treaty.
I know this may be a very disturbing time for you.
That's why I'd like to emphasize again how I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
The European Union and the countries outside the European Union share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving health services for the benefit of patients and communities we care for.
We really want you to stay."
Christion Ebercromby has undergone emergency surgery after head injury
Half-back of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Ebercromby, had an emergency operation after he had suffered head injury in a Sunday match against the Vanderbilt Comodores, who his team lost with account 31:27.
The Chief Trainer of Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He came to the side line where he was angry," said Reed.
On the sideline, the coaches and medical staff gave Ebercromby oxygen before taking it on the load for further testing.
The official representative of Tennessee State Tigers informed Chris Harris of the WSMV channel (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie had operated at the University of Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "until this time there is no evidence of the type and severity of the injury" on the Tennessee State Tigers team, they're trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-year student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after he moved from the Illinois team.
He did five captures of the ball on Sunday before he quit the game, so during the season he's got 18 captures.
– Foreign buyers will pay more government taxes if they buy real estate in Britain
In response to Tori’s new plans, additional funds will be spent to help the homeless
This action neutralizes all Corbin's efforts to involve young voters
The higher government tax will be drawn from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
In the Ministry of Finance, it is hoped to attract an additional 120 million pounds per year to help the homeless
As Teresa May announced today, foreigners who buy real estate in Britain are going to pay more taxes.
This step can be seen as an attempt to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing for highly paid workers.
The raising of customs will involve physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the government will provide additional funds to help those who are forced to spend the night in the open sky.
An additional tax, accompanied by a two-year-old increase in housing and real estate for rent, may be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects an additional 120 million pounds a year.
In London, 13% of the new real estate that is being built is estimated to be owned by foreign citizens, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for people who just dream of their own housing.
Many rich regions of the country, especially in the capital, are deserted because a large number of foreign buyers live most of the time outside the country.
The new plan of action appeared just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lower national tax to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of real estate by buying land without further use of it, and he urged Theresa May to give up the quota of available real estate to fix the "dishonest situation in the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of important reforms in the realm of immobility, such as the control of rent and the failure to remove without valid grounds.
He also offers to extend the authority of the local council in the construction of new housing.
Theresa May said, "Today I promised that I would dedicate my premiere to the restoration of the British dream -- for every new generation of life must be better.
This requires a change in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always remain open to those who want to live, work and build their future here.
However, it is not fair to say that individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, buy housing under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own housing has become unattainable, and the problem of living in the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "Most of all, I want to be the chief coach of the Scots Congregation."
Jack Ross, the chief FC coach of Sanderland, says that "most of all wants" will ever lead Scotland's collection.
A 42-year-old Scotsman went to rebuild the club from the northeast of the country, which is now ranked third in the First soccer league, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning the last FC Saint-Mirren season to the Prime Minister of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to Scotland's second collection, but it's all over," Ross told me during the Sportssound program at BBC Scottland radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of the Scottish Congregation at Hampden Park Stadium, which always attracted me.
"The only hope for me is to be successful as the head coach of the club."
The predecessors of Ross to the FC Sanderland, including Dick the lawyer, David Moys, Sam Ellardays, Martin O'Neil, Roy King, Gustavo Point, and Paulo DiCanio.
Former FC Chief Trainer Alla Atlettick claims he didn't feel nervous about going to a big club following such authoritative names, rejecting previous suggestions from FC "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"I'm now going to think I've succeeded if the club returns to the Prime Minister League.
Because of its structure and its material and technical support, this club no doubt corresponds to the Prime Minister League," he noted.
"It's not going to be easy, but the other result I don't think I'm going to be successful."
Ross has been a coach for only three years, and he's been a second coach at the FC Dumbarton, and he's spent 15 months at FC's Garts.
And then he helped "Hello" get ready after the FC got to the third division, and the next season, from the St.
According to Ross, he's now more comfortable than ever during his FC game career at Clyde, the Garlpool, the Folkerck, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"I'm at a crossroads," he mentions, referring to the transition to FC "Hello."
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more appropriate for me than playing.
That sounds strange, because I was successful, I was good at it, I was good at it, I was good at it, and I was getting some heights.
But it's not easy to play.
There's a lot of problems that you have to deal with every week.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as the chief coach, I feel at my place.
I've never felt more comfortable in my adult life than since I chose this profession."

Study: 5:30 p.m. Sunday is perfect time for a beer cook
The summer heat has helped to increase the revenue of British pubs, which are going through bad times, but have increased the pressure on the restaurant network.
In July, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.9 percent, while the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.9 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA, who consults on business development, noted: "Since sun weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup, July passed the same pattern as the previous month, when the revenue of the pubs grew by 22.7 percent, and restaurants went even worse.
The red fall of 1.9 in July increased.
Pubs and bars that are so focused on the supply of drinks, so far they have the best scores -- increasing their profits is equivalent to losing restaurants.
The pubs that serve food were also affected by the heat, but not as much as restaurants.
Seems the visitors are only interested in drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, the sales of drinks in a month increased by 6.6 percent, while sales of food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst of the leisure and hotel department of RSM, said, "The same trends we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sports events remain major factors affecting sales on the domestic market.
It's not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to lose their profits.
A long hot summer didn't come at the best time for food - let's see if the temperate temperature we saw in August can give them the needed rest."
In July, the total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new facilities, was 22.7 percent, reflecting the slowing down of new brands.
The Gallusian measure of sales volume of Coffer Peach Tracker in the United Kingdom’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance of 47 workgroups whose aggregate sales exceed 9 billion pounds [9 billion pounds] of sterling.
▪ 1 out of every 5 children have a hidden social networking account from their parents
According to the findings, 1 out of every 5 children, sometimes under 11 years of age, have a hidden social networking account from parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
This news added to the concern about possible sexual content
About 20% of the students reported having a "basic account" that they're showing parents
Every five children, sometimes under 11 years of age, create a social networking account that hides from adults.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages in Instagram -- a social network to exchange photos.
This news has intensified concerns about possible sexual content.
20 percent of the students reported having a clean “basic ” account that was shown to parents and to one or more private ones.
Mother, who accidentally stumbled upon the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a call to rape me.
A study conducted by Digital Access UK and Headmasters and HMC in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social networking profiles. Half of these children admitted that an additional account is secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC Association, said, "We're very concerned that many teenagers feel that they want to create an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elide Doyle will be the "Athletic Athletic Athletes" representative on the Scotty Athletics Council.
Aide Doyle is elected to the Scotty Athletics Council as independent director of the annual general board.
The head of the Council of Yong Beatty called this a great opportunity for those who lead the sports movement to take advantage of its extensive experience at the international level during the past decade.
"Eylid has great respect among the athletes of Scotland, Britain, and the world, and we are convinced that by joining her in the council, the athletic sport in Scotland will be of great benefit," assured Beatty.
Doyle said, "Inspired to act as a representative of athletes, I hope I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland."
An American, a four-time Olympic champion who won 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games and now a BBC sports tourner, lost the opportunity to walk through a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote in Twitter, "That month I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much.
I have learned to walk again, and today I am practicing dynamically!
Thank you for your words of support."
In advertising the milk sucker of women compared to cows -- the opinion of the Internet users split
The milk sucker manufacturer has encountered a vague reaction of the Internet user to an ad that compares young mothers to active cows.
To mark the release of a product called “the world's first quiet soft milk sucker, ” Elvie's consumer engineering company released an advertisement in the gumorist music video to demonstrate the freedom that a new sucker gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cow cow under a song that says, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail," and, "If you see it yourself, it's not a spell, but my breasts."
And then he sings the choir, "Suck it, suck it, to feed the children, suck it, suck it, so as not to waste milk."
However, the commercials published on the Facebook company page led to a turbulent discussion online.
Videos have gained 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the response of the Internet users has been mixed, and many have noted that advertising underestimates the “depressive organization ” of milk production in the industry.
"It's not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their children are meanly taken away from them a few days after birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie milk-absorpacier can easily be hidden in a feeding bra (Elvie/Moother)
Here's another comment: "It's clear that it's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you use them to advertise a milk sucker for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone added, "This ad is so far from reality."
And other users have come up to defend the commercial, and one of the women's videos seemed "very fun."
"I think that's a genius idea.
I'd definitely have bought something like that if she still breast-feeded.
When I sucked my milk, I really felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I didn't look for hidden content in it.
It's a great product," wrote someone.
Here's another comment: "A funny ad that's designed for mommys who suck milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This ad is not about highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk suckers hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use these products feel like cows.
But Elvie's sucker works perfectly quietly, has no wires or tubes, and easily hides in a breast-feeder for feeding, which allows women to move freely, hold children, and even go outside.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of the Weather Advertising Agency, commented on this situation: "The Elvie Sucker is so revolutionary that it requires a bright and provocative presentation.
After passing a parallel between women who heal milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the breast-feeding features, in an exciting and interesting way, showing the incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker would bring.
It's not the first time Elvie's sucker gets into news headlines.
Within the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on a weekend with this product while showing clothes from model Martha Yakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children increased dramatically, although the monthly crossing of the border remained relatively constant, partly because harsh rhetoric and politics by Trump administration made it difficult to place children in caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases the caregivers were the immigrants themselves, without papers, and now they're afraid to put their own chance of staying in the country at risk, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to give fingerprints and that this data would be passed to immigration agencies.
Last week Matthew Albins, high-officer of the Bureau of Migration and Tax Control, testified before Congress that the Office's colleagues had arrested dozens of people who applied for juvenile care without escort.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Over 80 percent of persons who are caregivers or members of their households are in the country illegally, many of whom are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we're continuing to persecute these people," said Mr. Albins.
According to asylum officials, in order to deal more quickly with child cases, officials have introduced new rules that require some of the children to appear in court within a month after being arrested, not 60 days later, as they used to be.
Many of them will be able to use the video conference instead of coming to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who, by a court decision, have no right to receive asylum will be quickly deported.
According to asylum officials and official data from officials in recent months, the longer the children are under guard, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can cause violent outbursts or escape attempts.
The advocates of law claim that these problems are intensified in institutions of larger size, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological state of children.
They added that by moving children to a tent town and not giving enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends, we risk increasing the trauma that many of them have already suffered.
Syria ordered the U.S., France and Turkey's "the occupation forces" to withdraw the troops immediately.
In addition, in addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualham called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been in war for eight years.
Mualem, who also works as deputy prime minister, claimed that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the influence of the fight against terrorism, so "the treatment of them will be appropriate."
"They have to go immediately and not make a deal," he stated at the assembly.
Mualm insisted that "the war on terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He claimed that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The U.S. has placed about 2,000 military officers in Syria, mainly teaching and consulting the Kurd forces and Syrian Arabs, who are speaking against President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war - torn country, France has taken over 1,000 soldiers.
In the case of refugees, Mualem assured the country had the right conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" of spreading "unreasonable fears" that prevented refugees from returning.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help people come back," he said.
"We're seeing an attempt to politicize a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not assist Syria in rebuilding the country until the political treaty between Assad and the opposition to the end of war has been concluded.
The U.N. Diplomas will report that the recent treaty between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlibu, the last large area of the rebels, has opened the way for political negotiations to continue.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish Treaty, it was possible to prevent large-scale Syrian forces supported by Russia from attacking a province of three million people.
But Mualem stressed that the treaty has "smart terms," and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the protesters, including al-Qaida-related fighters of the al-Qaida al-Nasr Front, who would be "destroyed."
UN Embassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee soon to include government representatives and opposition to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem set the terms for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, stating that its work should be limited to “a review of the articles of the valid constitution, ” and warned against intervention.
Why the Trump will be re-choiled
According to this logic, Trump can be reconfigured in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, he does not make up his authority in the post-scrip and impeachment period.
No doubt it would be the "most dramatic end of the presidentship of all time"!
At the moment, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and has actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the Rachel Madow Show program on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of a rating of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when major news was being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our comprehension," said Neil Behr, executive producer of the last candidate drama on ABC's channel about the secretary of state who becomes president after the destruction attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovell, an experienced humorist writer and author of the book "The Only Funny moments: and a few hard truths about entering the Hollywood men's club," offers another theory.
She remembered a trip to a Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's laughing at me," he said.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington can determine the future of Row versus Wade, the possibility of reuniting immigrant families, and the state of the world economy.
Away is the luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it can't be said that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you're watching a team of experts for six hours discussing Bob Woodward's use of "good-known" sources for his book The Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket ("a dress for the haughty") and the effects of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Tramp's anatomy published by Stormy Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
"The sense of a reality show is partly connected to the fact that you are consonant with something new every night," remarked Brent Montgomery, chief executive director of Weelhouse Entertainment, and author of the TV program "The Pawnbard Stars," about rotating in an actor's pool, and daily storybacks in the "Tramp" show (a NFL conflict, support by Kim Chen Ina).
If you allow yourself to skip one episode, you can hopelessly stay behind.
When I was able to meet Mr. Flace this week in his house on the north coast of Cauai Island, there was warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from TV, not when Britt Cavanaugh stood before the Senate Juridical Committee, and the Supreme Court's future hung in the hair.
"Remember how we used to create all these crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I took it as a joke, but it looks like they were right."

External infusions of funds into the most severe inter-con Congress elections
It's no wonder there's an extra cash flow in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, because by looking at the boundaries of the election districts, two of the right congressmen are running for one chair.
In the struggle for this suburb of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, there is a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who won a victory in another region in the additional elections last spring.
Lemb stands up to another valid congressman, the Republican of Kit Rothfs, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are much the same as the new 17th.
Maps were converted after, in January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old boundaries of the regions were drawn to the benefit of the Republicans in spite of the constitution.
Pre-electoral races in the new 17th district have led to strong opposition between the financial subdivisions of the major parties, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee for Congress elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NCRC).
The name Lemba became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning with a minimal advantage in the 18th district during the additional elections to Congress in March, which took public attention.
President Donald Trump won a 20-point victory in this area.
Political experts have given little advantage to democratics.
In the United States, they considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for support of China, but they changed their mind
The Diplomas reminded us of Washington's weak resistance to the Dominican Republic and Panama's actions, which had previously supported Beijing's position.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Pana, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 1951, before Trump had a hotel in Panama, until his partners took out the personnel hired by Trump Organization.
The officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama because of “the recent decisions about Taiwan’s ignorance, ” declared the press secretary of the Department of Gezer Neuert earlier this month.
But it was only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in American aid in 1951, particularly in drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this country of Central America with its high unemployment and murder rates.
According to the results of the internal governing body of the North and Central American states, the conference was postponed at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, followed by an analogous event last year, and was viewed as a step forward in efforts to curb the flow of immigrants in the United States.
But by the middle of September, the high officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, and in fact, that's where the issue of the authorization against El Salvador ended.
According to the diplomacy, Vice President Mike Pans is now planning to speak at a conference scheduled for mid- Oct. to indicate that the administration considers this to be very important.
At that time three American messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, because there were no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's representative at the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that three American officials, two of whom were diplomacy, told on anonymous terms.
The information they gave was confirmed by a foreign analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on anonymous terms.
Learn History
The next problem may be a report by Special prosecutor Robert Muller on possible interference with justice on the part of Trump, powerful evidence of why it can be found in the public information currently available.
As part of his investigation, Muller is reported to be checking the possible link between Trump's campaign and the attack on our voting system by Russia.
If Congress's influence moves into other hands, Trump will have to report to Congressmen, just as it does to the election and eventually to the same party.
There's a lot of "ifs" in this case, and I don't mean to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, just like his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that determines the duration of the fight.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to set up a coup against Hitler if only the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is determined by such crucial moments, and the uncontrollable movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a number of these critical moments.
What are we going to do if Trump fires the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein -- the man who depends on Mr. Muller's fate?
Rosenstein was in trouble even when the newspaper reported that he was offering to secretly record conversations with the president and to share his thoughts on Trump's mismatch.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times untrue.
"How will we react if the investigation against Britta Cavanaugh, which the FBI recently started, turns out not to be thorough enough or honest enough, or if Cavanaugh's candidacy is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite strong accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, will we, in the medium term, vote for those Congress members who can hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz to the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's house.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on the swastika table.
Having such an inheritance, can I not look with optimism into the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting the Vienna Rapid.
The FC Rangers takes Rapid on Thursday, and after an astounding nothing in Spain at the game of Villarreal at the beginning of this month's victory over the Austrians, the Scottish Club will provide a good chance of getting out of Group G of the League of Europe.
Because of the knee injury, Half Protector Graham Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a match with "Villarreal," which ended with a score of 2:2, but he believes that FC Rangers can use this as a tramplin to achieve more.
"This was a good result for us, because "Villarreal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with hope of getting something and got one point.
Maybe at the end of the match, we could go forward, but in general, nothing is likely to be considered a fair result.
In the first half, the opponent was better, but after the break, we fixed the situation in our favor.
On Thursday there will be another important opposition in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not going to be easy, our future opponents have shown good results in their last game, but we can count on support for the fans, and I'm sure we can give the fight and get a positive result.
This past year, of course, was difficult, starting with my injuries and ending up with the changes in the club itself, but now the situation is normal.
We have a great warehouse, and all the guys are happy.
I hope we can move on, leave behind last season and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of retirement savings
Even though the surveyers had a clear idea of how they would like to organize their own care, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who were involved in Nationwide research said they were talking to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of those interviewed spoke to the children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't rush to start talking about this," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance unit.
That's where you start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children, your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need unless you tell your parents your wishes in advance.
consult with your consultant and family to determine where and how you receive care, since this choice may be an important factor in determining the cost.
Involve a financial consultant: he can recommend how to cover the related expenses.
The sources of funding for long-term care include the traditional policy of insurance, the hybrid policy of accumulating life insurance, or self-sufficiency at your own expense (as long as you have money).
Prepare your legal documents carefully: this will enable you to avoid legal burdens in advance.
Prepare confidence for your representative, who will control your health care and make sure that your wishes are done if you are not able to do so personally.
Also, we recommend that we establish trust in the management of money.
Select a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay accounts if you fail.

In Ilfracum, a man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man shot a couple of times with a pneumatic rifle when he came home from a party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfrakum, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
The officers described the shooting that took place at 2:30 p.m. in British summertime as "random."
The victim has not seen the attacker.
His wounds are no threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthqua earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palou on Friday, reports state authorities, but the number of casualties can go up.
Because of the collapse of the communications system, officials working on humanitarian assistance cannot get any information from the Dungal regent, a region north of Pala, near the magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic pulmonary and magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic pulmonary magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic puls and magnetic puls and magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic puls cans are puls and magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic puls cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans and puls can be used puls and puls cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans can be puls cans cans off the air down down from the air down from the air and puls and exps cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans and exps cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans cans off from the down down down down from the down from the down from the down from the air down from the air down from the air down from the air down from the air down from
After a natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Let's give you some basic facts about the city of Palu, the island of Sulavesi, and the Dungal regentship.
The palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800, according to the data for the year 1951.
When the earthquake caused by the tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regentship that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
According to the 1717 census, the administrative region in the lower part of the province has a population of some 292,200.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic areas of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel acquisition is also important in the province, but it's mainly focused on Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Palu and Dongal have suffered from tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938 the tsunami killed more than 200 people in Dongala and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996 the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, and then nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active Pacific fire ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.

Sarah Palin's eldest son, Sarah Palin, was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
According to a Saturday report published by the Alaska State Police, 29-year-old Palin of Vasilly, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with disrupting the report of violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman I knew tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took away her phone.

Federal accusers require rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City
In New York City, federal accusers demand the death penalty of Syfulllo Sayipov, a suspected terrorist in New York City who killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crime since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saïpes, said to have taken a bicycle ride along the highway in the West Side, Lower Manhattan, while driving a rented pickup at Home Depot, and started to shoot the cyclists and pedestrians that he had on his way.
In line with the announcement of the intention to get executed in the South District of New York to justify the death penalty, the accusers must prove that Syipov's "sacredly" killed eight people and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the judicial records, each of these counts provides for the possibility of capital punishment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of the jury charged Saïp with 22 counts, including eight murder charges for the purpose of demanding, which are usually brought against federal accusers in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the accusers who described Saïp's crime as "harvest, cruel and malicious," this attack is the result of "thoughtful planning and preconceived reasoning."
Saipup's victims were Diego Enrice Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lora Decadadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferruche, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnacco, as described in the message of purpose.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time a capital offense was committed in the South District of New York City.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the federal death penalty was carried out in New York City in 1953, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's married couple were executed after they had been convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the judicial records of Saïp, a native of Uzbekistan, he showed no remorse the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the police that he had no regrets about what he had done.
According to Sayipov's guilty act, he informed the authorities that he had been inspired to launch an attack on an IDl video that he was watching on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang the IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He did not find himself guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sayipova, said that they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than to accept confessions of guilt and sentence life imprisonment without the possibility of release only reinforces the psychological trauma caused by these events on the part of all victims," said Patton.
Sayipov's defense party had also earlier asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
MP of Parliament of the Conservative Party believes that NYJEL FARAJA needs to be appointed to be in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Today, during the protest at the Congress of the Conservative Party, Nelson Faraj promised to "mobilize the national army."
The former leader of the United Kingdom independence party stated that politicians should “rehearse pressure ” from the European Union because one of the members of Parliament, Theresa May, has offered his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
MP Peter Bowe of the Conservative Party announced at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "been coming out" if Mr. Faraj was secretary of Brexit.
The attention to the problems May faced in trying to reconcile its deeply divided ranks has been further attracted by the fact that MPs from the Conservative Party, who oppose the exit, joined a special protest campaign in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister tries to enforce the Chequests compromise plan despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those who oppose the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that she won't give up her efforts to negotiate with her despite the negative reaction, and that she'll make the Europscaptics and the Laborists choose between what she offers and "haosm."
At the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solichal, Mr. Bow said he wanted to "return from Chequers."
He asked Mr. Faraj to step out of the shadow and take responsibility for the negotiations with the WH.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out," he said.
Parliament MP Wellingborough added, "I'm going to support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We didn't fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bowe rejected the assumption that after the vote in 2016, public opinion changed: "The idea that the British had changed their minds and refused to come out is completely untrue."
Conservative Party member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to reporters, "I'm just saying, "Priest Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular among the public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not backed by our party and our activists who actually walk the streets and fight for the votes of the voters.
Please throw away the Chequers and start listening."
In her address to Theresa May, she added, "The prime minister keeps his office when he fulfills his promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians should be pressured if they were to refuse a decision made at the 2016 disco.
"Now this is a question of trust between us, people and our political elite," he stated.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them they won't get away with it."
In a report to a enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, who is planning to betray Brexit, to feel pressure.
We're mobilizing the national army of this country that will lead us to victory at Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-conscious, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the opponents went through Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved the banners Conservatives vs. Brexit after the group was launched on these weekends.
Laborist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives because since the opening of the conference, security issues had arisen because of their party program.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technology needed by Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing good about Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning to think seriously about running for president.
U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the election in November, she would "think seriously about running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the general assembly in West Massachusetts, a representative of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for a second term in November against a member of the Jeff Dill Republican Party, who was a co-leader of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
And that's what they view as the main candidate that can fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she had her 36th meeting with the voters in the general assembly format since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to participate in the election as president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington, D.C. and set up the government, and for that to happen, there must be a woman in his head."
They arrested a suspect in a gun-killed basketball basketball player, LSU Tigers, Simsa.
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that a suspected gunman was arrested on Friday by a basketball player named Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in the East.
On Friday, they published a shooting video with a request to help identify the person on it.
By 20-year-old Simms was shot at Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wade Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died as a result," declared 247sports to the 247sports on Saturday, Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul.
Wade stepped in for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found to be at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun with him, and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Batton Police Department.
Sims, whose height was 6 feet and 6 inches, and who played in the Junior League, grew up in Baton Rouge, and played 32 games with 10 stars last season, and spent an average of 17.4 minutes in the field, dialing 5.6 points and 2.9 pickups.
Lewis Hamilton reduced his delay in World Cup championship after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettel.
From the moment that Walthery Bottas left behind Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the poul post and nearly passed Hamilton, who tried to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel an opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to Pit-stop first and left Himilton on the road in the tail of the race that was supposed to solve everything.
The Mercedes crew pilot drove another circle and left behind Fettel, but Hamilton broke into the leaders after a certain wheel to the wheel maneuver, causing Ferrari's driver to reluctantly leave the interior space because of the risk that he would be clamped, after a double maneuver managed to make his way forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappin started from the back of the net and stayed in seventh place until the end of the first circle.
Pottaw led most of the race, because he didn't change the tires to get to the finish quickly and move Kimmy Rykkonen out of fourth place.
Finally, he stopped at the pit stop on the 44th knee, but he couldn't increase the pace at the last eight, so Rykkonen sat fourth.
"It's a hard day, because Walttery was full on all weekends, and he was nobility when he gave me the opportunity to pass.
The team did an extraordinary job to take first and second place," said Hamilton.
The Language of the Body Was Not Impressed
President Donald Trump ridiculed senator Diane Feynstein for her firm stand in not declaring the contents of a letter from Christine Blazey Ford accusing a candidate before the Supreme Court of Britta Cavanaugh of sexual violence.
During a speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the presentation given by Ford to the Juridical Committee of the Senate, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate that, he said, demonstrated man's "insolence, vileness and lying."
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the last few days is anger, you see the evil people who are displaying vileness, vileness and lying," he said.
"You're looking at the publications and the public information, and then they're like, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feynstein, did you share the information?
Remember her answer... did you advertise the contents of the documents? - "What?
Oh, no.
I didn't advertise."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't advertise," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July Feynstein came a letter detailing the charges dropped by Ford v. Cavanaugh, and in early September his contents were made public, but Feynstein denied that the leak of information had taken place in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't share the information I received from her," said Feynstein to the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promise."
But her objection seems to have displeased the president who commented at the Saturday meeting, "I'll tell you, her body language wasn't at all astonishing.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone get worse."
Continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court who was accused of sexual violence by three women, the president assumed that the Democrats were using charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power in any necessary way.
You see vileness, vileness, they don't care who they're offended, who they need to step over to gain power and control," Mediaite quotes the president's words.
The elite league: Dundee Stars -- Belfast Jaiants, 5:3
Player Patrick Dwayer dropped two pucks in a match against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars were rehabed for a five-day defeat in the elite league from Belfast Giants, winning a five-three-third match and report on Saturday.
The Jaiants got an early advantage of two pucks, thanks to Patrick Duyer and Francis Boville's rolls.
Mike Sallyvan and Jordan Cooney have leveled the score in a home match, and then Dwayer has redirected the Jants.
The Dundee player, François Bushard, has leveled the score, and two of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's goals ensure their victory.
This is the third time in the elite league season to defeat the team of Adam Keef, who won the free will victory over Dundee with a score of 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
It's the fourth team meeting in the season.
Dwayer's first puck dropped at four minutes (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall McFall, and four minutes later, Boville, who got a puck from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period of fourteen minutes (13:10), Salivan returned the owners of the field to the game, and for sixteen minutes (15:16) Kooney, after receiving a puck from Matt Markwardt, compared the score.
Dwayer provided the advantage of the Giants before the first break, throwing his second puck at the end of the first period.
The masters of the fields regrouped, and Bushard at twenty-eight minutes (27:37) rebalanced the score by dropping the puck when his team had a huge majority.
Thanks to the efforts of Coney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, for the first time brought Dundee forward and assured the victory of his team in the last five-half-century period.
On Friday, the Jaints team, who has already lost four of the last five matches, will play a race against Milton-Kines.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on a plane could escape an earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared hero after he had helped fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
Over 800 people died and many lost their lives after the severe earthquake that caused the tsunami on the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Strong underground tremors continue to rock the area, and many people are trapped in the rubbles in the city of Palou.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agun refused to leave his post in a highly dispersed control tower at Mutira SIS Al-Juffry Airport in Pala.
He stayed there to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, who was on the landing strip at the time, was safely lifted into the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going down.
Afterward, he died in the hospital.
The representative of the Indonesian Aeronautical Provider Company, Johannes Sirite, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News, Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balipapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of casualties can reach thousands, because the disaster relief agency of the country claims that access to Dongala, Sighi, and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims can go up because many bodies are still under debris, and many of them cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves up to six feet [6 m] high devastated the city of Pala, where mass burials would be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes carry relief and food supplies.
Rhysa Kusum, 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water.
"The mini-marquets have been plundered everywhere."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfund, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they're going to find.
It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
President Joko Vido of Indonesia arrived in Pale on Sunday and said to the country's military officers, "I ask you all to work day and night to do all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on Lombok Island that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: As Air Niugini reported, after the plane fell into the lagoon, one man vanished.
The airline that was flying the Pacific lagoon disaster in Micronesia now claims that one person has vanished, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini said that it was impossible to find a single passenger on Saturday day.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a husband and are working with local authorities, hospitals, and inquirers to do so.
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane landed on the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported six passengers staying in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all stable.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
Air Company and U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in a lagoon near the landing strip.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has flown in the airstrip.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane flew very low above the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told me that he and others were able to get to the emergency exits on a thin plane by girding their waist in water.
He told us that the stewardess panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the modernization of the quay also helped in rescue operations by bringing people to shore by means of an inflatable boat before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
In the past two decades, 111 people have died in PNG-related airline accidents, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst restored the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution took a case against a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rollett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified as an expert in the field of operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to replicate the movement of 29-year-old accused Queenton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette, according to The Clary Ledger, told him that he had received the location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers that evening when she died, which contradicts his previous statement.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the accusers asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was in the Sanford pickup, Sanford said he was "blowing, because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another mistake was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Phone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulette told me that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers' phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Gale.
The defense must present its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be transferred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop-guilty wants to challenge a negative view of genre, filling his music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group of Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature -- political ideas and the struggle to solve social problems have gone away.
They want to go back to the origins and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugues and Commons have recently witnessed the revival of this trend in the United Kingdom through groups like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
In New York City, the nanny sued a couple for release, getting a "racist" message.
In New York City, the nanny filed a suit against a couple for discriminating release after she had received an incorrectly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was another black.
The couple deny that they're racist, comparing the suit to "extortion."
Linda Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw the new nanny, Giselle Morris, who came on her first day of work in 2016, black.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
But instead of sending it to her husband, she twice sent it to Mrs. Morris.
As reported by New York Post, aware of her mistake, Mrs. Plaxson-Flaxman felt "inconvenient" and released Miss Morris, and she claimed that their previous African-American nanny was not doing her job well and that instead she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Miss Morris paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now, Morris is suing a couple, hoping to get a pay-as-you-as-you-pay compensation for a six-month job with the couple she was first hired to do, even though she had no contract. She was to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them I don't have to do this," she said to Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the charge that they were racists, the couple claimed that the liberation of Morris was a wise decision because they feared that they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent.
She's not a racist.
We're not going to race," reported Post to her husband Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with the man you treated rudely, even if it wasn't deliberate?
With your baby?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Comparing the suit with "extortion," Plasco said his wife had a baby only two months ago and "didn't get ready."
"Would you avenge anyone after that?
This is a bad deed," added an investment banker.
Although the trial is still in progress, the public opinion court has quickly condemned the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
According to the new letter, Padington’s publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear who was able to speak
The daughter of Bonda Karen Janekel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to print, said about the letter, "It's hard to put herself in the position of the first reader of the book before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know of the huge success that Padington's story has made."
Telling that her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a child book, was optimistic about his being rejected, she shared how, on the 60th anniversary of the book's release, she felt "joy and sorrow" at the same time, because his father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was a rather humble man and didn't like to brag," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child, because when kids do something, we're proud of them, not theirs, but our victories.
I think he was looking at Padington's success that way.
Though Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye by phone
After her daughter landed, she was taken to the two Louis Pasteur hospitals in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"No, I regularly called, said it was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperus.
"And then Od phoned me and said she'd die in the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating gradually ceased to act and left her body.
She died a while before everything was shut off.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn't mourn, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
She should have really held herself together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who had suffered the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, ignoring the severe trials she had to endure.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I dropped my head and couldn't hold back the tears.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deep compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave postcards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries leave on the Wallian bridge cards with phone numbers that people can call for support and messages to inspire them.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and at age 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way as I do every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, who lives in London, told me that her son was a promising chef with a pretty smile.
"Everyone knew him for smiling.
They always said that smile made any room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died, because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid it's going to have consequences."
Miss Davis created the cards, so people know that there are people they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't get stuck in yourself, you have to talk."
Miss Hamfreys, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband Mark, who had been with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, depressed, depressed or depressed," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas Day, he was completely discouraged, and when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to survive it, "It caused a devastating
I'm going to have to go to the family.
But we have to keep on living and fighting."

Britta Cavanauaugh's future is hanging in the hair: the FBI is starting an investigation.
"I thought that if we could get what we asked for -- limited in the time and nature of the investigation -- we might have reached some agreement," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and added that he feared that the committee was breaking up in the face of an inevitable loss of allegiance to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his press fans want the FBI to investigate?
Their refusal is connected with time.
The mid-term elections will be held in just five weeks, November 6, if the Republic is expected to have problems, it will seriously complicate their efforts to hold their own people through elections to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush phoned the senators asking to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush's rule and who led him to meet his wife, Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, the vote will be taken.
It is still unclear if Mr. Cavanaugh could get at least 50 votes at the Senate sitting, allowing Vice President Mike Pans to solve the problem with the same number of votes and to approve his candidacy as Supreme Court Justice.
During the reign of Kima, the number of North Korean survivors "sooned"
After Kim Chenn In came to power seven years ago, the number of North Koreans to South Korea was reduced, the South Korean lawgiver claimed.
Park Pion Seug, referring to data from the Ministry of the United Republic of South Korea, stated that the number of crossovers in the past year was 1,127 compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the key factors were the increased border control between North Korea and China, and that smugglers carrying illegals now charge more money.
In Pyongyang, they refrained from public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean conquerors eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans were declared to have crossed the border illegally after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than the well-protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China views crossovers as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcefully rehearses them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally in a state of war, has improved dramatically in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, leaders of two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issue of deuclarization, negotiations over which were clamored.
This happened after the June historical meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Cheng-yong in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in general on nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday North Korean Foreign Minister Ree Yon-Ho, in the background of the adopted penalties, accused the United States of not progressing since then.
"With no confidence in the U.S., we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no one-sided disarmament," stated Ree Yon-Ho in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York City.
Nancy Pelosi calls Britta Cavanauaugh "historic" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the position of Justice of the Supreme Court, Britta Cavanaugh, "historic" and stated that he was at the same rate as the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've always thought that if a woman ever performed this way, she'd be called 'historic'," Pelosi commented on her reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony to the Juridical Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the charge of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost yelling and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him an "absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation," by the organized liberals, who were upset that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential elections in 2016.
According to Pelosi, Cavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice toward the Democrats.
"I think that with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will take his own candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was indignant when she was asked if she would try to give Cavanaugh an impression, if his guilt was confirmed, and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say that if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, it's not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he works now," said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is currently serving as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the district of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions against the "On Accessible Medical Care" Act or the "Ro v. Wade" case because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearing on the question of confirmation at Cavanaugh's office, he went to the side of the question of whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, biased person and we'll say how wonderful it is," said Pelosi.
Women must own this weapon.
These are just words that had accumulated months and years of anger, and she could not utter them without tears.
"We weep when we're angry," said Miss Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, but you?"
She went on to say, "One woman who worked somewhere as an executive director and really helped me, said she also weeps when she was angry, but she had her own technique, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to her talker, "You can think that I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
And I am evil."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are considered to be a legitimate way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my most subtle memories of my first job in the office, where most of the men worked, was when one time I wept from indescribable anger, and an older woman -- an unkind manager that I've always feared -- caught me by a cell and dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will think that you are sad, and rejoice that they have come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democracy congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught out of wedlock on board a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, the deeply frustrated Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a very deliberate decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate was the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation Snow White and Seven Dwarves.
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was falling behind in the fundraiser, so she made a promise that she wouldn't take part in the race if she didn't raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her adherents, who had no regrets for the support of men of $1,000, had only given her $250.
"They think I'm going to get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave the talk and announced that she would not hold a formal campaign, she was emboldened by the gratitude of the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made it very difficult to collect money and forced her to be less selective than the members of the House of Representatives, and the anger of sexism, and she was ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schrader's reaction to the press.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
Did I still think about what they would write on my tombstone?
Did she cry?
How the trade war between the United States and China can bring benefits to Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and, although far before it is over, in the long run, divisions between countries can benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots early this year, taxing major Chinese export goods, such as solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
Most of the situation has escalated this week because of new product fares totaling $200 billion (150 billion pounds), which actually tax half of all goods that are coming to the U.S. from China.
Peking paid back with the same coin every single time, recently putting a five-to-ten-per-cent token on American goods at 60 billion dollars.
China has committed itself to similar U.S. measures, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to soon miss the opportunity to keep that promise.
To force Washington to retreat means to accept the demands, but for Chinese president Xi Jingpin, the U.S. public worship is too shameful.
However, experts believe that if Beijing takes proper advantage of the situation, the pressure in the U.S. trade war can bring China a long-term advantage by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic collapse in any country, and this is actually more dangerous than observers have recognized before," said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asian-related issues at the Center for New American Security think tank.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “pready ” for the return of the refugees
In Syria, they claim to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and to seek help in rebuilding a country devastated by war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Secretary Walid al-Moualham stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"The real situation today has become more stable and secure because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild terrorist-ruined areas so that people can get back to normal.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have had to abandon because of terrorism, as well as one-sided economic measures that have affected their daily lives and limited their livelihood.
UN estimates that more than 1.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
The al-Mualham claimed that the Syrian government would be pleased to accept help in restoring a war - torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the riot.
Europe reinforces the victory of the Rider Cup in Paris
Europe's team conquered the Ryder Cup in 2018 when the U.S. team won with a total score of 16.5:1.5 on Le Gulf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time and has not won the Cup of Ryder tournament since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn gained the 14.5 points they needed to win the victory over the United States.
The American star Phil Miquelson, who worked hard for most of the tournament, hit his first long shot on the 16th hole of steam-3 into the water and gave in to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his games and became one of the four players who had ever gone through a score from 5 to 0 to 0 since the start of the modern-style tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost a score of 5:4 from the lowest-rated player in the European team Turbburn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world's rating, gave up on account 2:1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in the last time in the Ryder Cup tournament.
The Spanish veteran of the Cup of Ryder, who had already participated eight times in the tournament, became the European who had won the most of the tournaments all the time, bringing 25.5 points to his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, so happy to return the cup.
And I'm glad I was able to help," said, without controlling emotion, Josiah after winning Europe.
He passes the escapade to his countryman John Reem, who on Sunday defeated the American golf legend of Tiger Woods in a single game with a score of 2:1.
"I feel incredible pride in winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, the Woods lost all four matches and now has a career record for the "Ryder Cup" tournament from 13 to 21 to 3.
Strange statistics for one of the most famous players of all time who won 14 Major tournaments with only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. Congregation tried to get to the fairway area all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-end golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said about his team after a discouraging performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we didn't dominate Europe for long.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the U.S. golf professional player association and the Ryder Cup tournament committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We can't help but commend them.
We lost."
Red tide information: reduced concentration in the districts of Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota
The latest report to the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife shows a general decline in red microorganisms in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to Florida’s Commission on Fish and Wildlife, the conditions of abundant flowering, reported in certain regions of Pinellas, Manolas, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, show a decline in concentration.
The blossom of red microorganisms stretches about 130 miles of the coastline from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee.
The spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but less than last week.
Red tide was also seen in Pasco County.
Last week they reported on the average concentration in the Pinellas area and its coastal zone, the concentration from low to high in the Hillsborough coastal zone, the high concentration in Manat, the high concentration in Sarasota and its coastal zone, the average concentration in Charlotte, the high concentration in Leigh and its coastal zone, and the low concentration in Collier.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, they continue to report respiratory irritation.
No such messages were registered in the northwest of Florida last week.
