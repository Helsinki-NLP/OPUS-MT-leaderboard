Parliament has not made an adjustment to give Timoshenko freedom.
The Parliament's decision was to make adjustments in the procedure under the Code of Criminal Justice, which was the decision of the Parliament, Julia Timoshenko.
The action, which would lead to a lawsuit to stay in the police force, was taken by the Supreme Court.
Timoshenko was in charge of seven years for gas and gas, and it was unprofitable.
The sentence is not yet executed; the trial is of Tymoshenko in France.
Timoshenko, that he was under the regime, that he was suspected of being in charge of the regime.
Under Article 365 of the Criminal Code, Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Justice was signed by 147 members of Parliament.
He'd have 226 votes for him.
Victory of the World

Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the hospital.
I've come to see you.
Usually in the run for the police; it's about whether you're dead or dead.
The transition is acting as a lawgiver of the Shariat Act, we've already gone.
Libya is going to be a homeless country, a thief's going to have his hands thrown away.
It is possible to talk about the institution; the apostates are apostates; etc.
The dictator's dictator, who is the rivals of the entire clans, will be declared by the Koran.
We're going to be in order, we can't imagine ourselves, and I don't think we're going to get ourselves.
Whatever the case, our image of marriage is not in any kind, nor in any kind, nor in any respect, nor in any respect, would it be in any way, in any way, in any way, in any way, in any way, in any way.
In fact, it's the idea that the authorities have taken action against it.
That according to them, the attack by NATO was not a general, but by Allah, which glorified them.
And they are not included in them.
We've been in gunfights, we've been serving Lucius, and we've been charged by the dictator, their Allied Union, without any action whatsoever.
I've recently had a sad experience with both the police and the police, and we're against the police.
It's a locality, so it's not a matter of the "People of the Russians" attack.
Is gold worthless for nothing?
You're not doing it, you're not doing it, and you're always looking at the unselfish rights.
It's not the end of Shariata.
It's time to start the campaign.

The storm has swept over a drunk in the United States.
They've declared GDP in 3 dollars.
There's a quarter block of Czechoslovakia in stagnation, growth and growth.
And yet, it's a record score.
Investing is no longer moving toward the country; it focuses on the country, the country, the country, and other organizations.
The Federal Bureau of the State of the State in the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the United States of America has declared their office of personnel in the country of the State of the State.
GDP at 0.5%; GDP at 0.4%.
Both of the units in the block, in the sector, are in the highest number (up by 0.3% of the population represents 0.1%). The rate is 0.1% (up by 0.1%) (up by 0.3%, the rate is 0.1%).
The Czech Republic showed a growth rate of 1.5 percent.
However, with a quarter block of GDP in stagnation, this is the Czech Bureau of Justice.
It's a lot worse than the prognosis.
What are you doing?
The Czech Republic showed a growth rate of 1.5 percent, but it's stuck on a block block.
I'm going to take you to the season and season, and I'm going to take 0.5%.
It's a quarter block growth rate of 0.2%, which is in line with the predictions of the gnats.
That's 55%.
The income of her 10-year-olds is 28.45%.
The income of both the central and the western sections of the borderline.
Even if it's a matter of time, it's a matter of time, it's a matter of time, it's a matter of time.
It's not that the income of Czech 1-year-olds is 4%.
In a conspirator, the EZB is a lender's attorney, and I will save the rest of the people.
Czech Republic's campaign in EURO.
You've got a 1:0 prize and a 200 dollar prize.
The team's done the season!
To the Czech and the beautiful goal of Peter Jirachek at 1:0.
The time of the Czech Republic's reign was the time of the match, and she took the lead in the fight.
IHNED.cz is behind the match and the match.
It's the most remarkable in the time and luck in the day.
The Great Czech; and the hero Jeiraczek; she won 1:0 in France, and wins the championships at the Company.
Presumptuous defense of the Czech Republic.
Damiachos and Vuncier became the match match match of how they missed the two parties.
The great Peter Chech is one of the reasons the Czechs will not miss the Champion of Parliament in the year, and the Czech football theme is about 200 ounces of Czech crowns.
I mean, it's been a long time.
Both cases with one combination; part part of it went into the field.
It's a long-term attack on the Czech regime.
I've got students in charge of the case.
They're shielding.
There are hundreds of students on the shield of the police in the United States.
The subject of the attack is to establish its authority before the attack against the State.
At noon for students' prayers at the entrance of the hospital, we pray for both the United States and the United States.
In Basfahan, U.S.A., there are hundreds of students on the shields of the Basfas, the Enrichment Factory.
So it's a matter of the law of justice.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
A possible attack on the U.S. Army in the United States took place in the United States.
At noon for students' prayers at the entrance of the Besfahan enriching factory, the U.S. and the U.S. are praying for both.
In an attack launched on the parallels of the police, the police to the press, the installation of both the Isfahan and the Natanz facilities, the government's power.
No breakfast, no sausage, no sausage.
About a third of every 9 to 13 years of age weighs more than that; in that way, as 9% of the population weight, 5% of obesity.
You know, you know, you're the one who's the one who's overweight, you're the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's
We've seen the presence of evil and models of evil for his or her health.
The sausage on the tables, the obesity, the two times as much as the birth weight, the weight ratio.
19% of the workers, obesity, eating on the fryer, looking at this event under Obesity, it's not obesity.
That's, however, the whole part of the population is 15% of the people said that they're the body's body's body for sports, just once in a while.
It was a total of 900 people.
It was held at the end of the year; it contains 900 million units of the Bohemia.
The mayor of Obesity -- this is a failure of a year's duration, under the insurance policy of Vṛseobecná zdravovotní pojiłāovna and Unilever.
The project has 12 students, 4 to 8 people.
Right action and sports by factors, by number, by number, either by person or by obesity.
"For example, half the city said it's five times a day, a breakfast-cook-cook-cook-cook-cook-cook-cook-cook-chop, and that's one of the advantages of right."
Breaking lunch and sausages for dinners
That for a healthy public, like breakfast.
I've got 23% of those who have breakfast.
They're all having breakfast on the same day.
The worst thing is that people don't have breakfast.
And yet breakfast is the basis for the right thing to do.
I've seen that a fried woman in a hospital with an obesity-free environment.
It's about 70% of the day.
About 40% of the population regularly engage in sports, a figure of up to 15% in sports, and a figure of up to 15% in their families.
I'll take the menu with you.
In one section of the population, 204 and 1962 out of 13 schools, there were menus, products, tastes, tastes, tastes, and tastes.
"The post office in Czech food for 12 or 15 years is far from healthy health."
It's a lot of meat, meat, and sweet dishes.
"Specify the popularity of sweets," in the last part of the paper.
In the center of the main dining dish of pasta paste, the bird with the overweight.
But they didn't show any favor for beans, dishes, and vegetables.
The pursuit of a healthy image
I've shown that they've been changing their foods, that they're going to have to take care of them.
"Many of the control measures on healthier diets, asked the Obesity Office for a healthful diet, it's not self-confidence," in the United States.
It was a lot of it, it was a lot of it, it was a lot of it, it was a lot of it, it was a lot of it, it was just water.
In addition to the main main dish of the Pied Piper and Pied Piper, sweet dishes and baking.
Stylist is a very good psychologist, you know.
I've been visiting the Style Training School in the School.
I have no idea what's going to happen next.
I'm going to go to the police station; I'm going to go to a non-standard police station; and I'm going to talk about how all of this is done in the office.
Next, more.
The more we go to the office, the more the police and the more we're assigned.
It's a three-way operation, but it's a good idea.
For once with Alenka, director, (there's not a single) we're going to find, like a house, the body's not quite symmetrical.
It's not symmetry.
In one short neck, in one boy's boy's boy's uniformless, only one weighs more.
Stylist knows how the shoulders will lengthen the shoulders or any missing.
We've been given such treatments as those of men such as Mrs. M. Lopez, i.e. a siege of a woman's breast, hips, and waist, and waist, and not to take them.
I'm going to make a lot of boobs and hips, which I'm going to do with pants or trousers, and I'm going to sew one of them for the order.
You're obviously not going to regret the investment, just sitting there.
You're going to be in an order sewn, you're going to be more self-efficient than that one, eating, sundown, naked waist, etc.
They can wear sleeves, applicants, embroidery, or folds.
I'm glad I've got a lot of shoes, and I'm glad I've got all of this stuff.
And yet, I'm afraid it's a lot, but we're doing it.
Two clothes for any celebrity, for day and evening.
We've put them in the shape of a species, their style, their type.
I'm going to take Miranda Kerr, and you can know by the ads of Victoria's Secret.
I'm happy about myself, because her care is easier than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguiler, which recently recovered by a ton (please note that I'm exaggerating), or young Selena Gomez.
We take you out of the magazines or find it in the hospital, print out the printouts and graphs.
Mudboard is the result of the government. It's our style, and it's our way of thinking about the graph of the state.
It's the best way to put it in the graph.
The stylist is not just a credit to the people, but a food package in magazines (on the average, on the average, in the fashion of a bag, in the coat, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik is talking about.
But it was in the middle of the day.
The Style of the Style of the Sty
Saturday's Day, about the types of people, brought everyone back to life.
Stylist, Honsa Pocorna; fashion designer Jakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
We are told by Jakub that fashion is an illusion and a fact-stylist.
You're a good stylist. One subject.
It's the key to the key.
You can wear your coat-wrath, you can wear your coat-wrath, you can wear your jeans and shirts like your coat; but you can wear it on your naked body, with no burns like your own.
It is to roll up sleeves or collars, and the whole image.
"Play with him," he said.
Anyway, I'm more likely to say, "For you to know the rules."
Then you can send them,' Jakub told us.
I knew that we were going to make all the rules and rules that deal with what and what, like the fashions of magazine magazines, we often see things.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I'm convinced that the stylist has a lot more clothes to wear than the police, and that he's in charge of it.
Yes, for the fashionable 10 tenths (equivalent to 10 robes) I'm ready to do as five fifths of images.
Now I know that in the picture, the subject is often framed and framed with someone different from the one in the picture.
We mean it, we've got an image.
Honsa Posorna, which is often a subjugation and style, half of the total.
Just put it on Madonna, don't beat her with the vocals, but her Zudge and marketing have put her in the Ptutu.
Aside from the stylers in the company, it's a very bad thing.
Even the people who do this are often the ones who do it (and the people who do it in something, or the way they do it in something).
And to us they are their style, and we are the ones who will bring us a little less than he who wears them.
And then we're going to Google and we're talking about Google, and we're talking about whether or not the placards were writing something about some famous fatty/ weight loss, etc.
Honsa and Mario focus on what for a stylist once in fashion and in the company of a dress.
Our work is basically with people, we're talking about people; it's important to be a good psychologist.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
"The manager asks you to hold her and to hold her beautiful, you can't clean her whole wardrobe, tell her she's terrible."
Says Mario.
He told us that it was specifically in the bag.
It's a bag, you bandage your waist, wear everything.
Besides knives, sticky roller skates or pins, it has nylon threads, or sewing kit.
We've got to get rid of this and get rid of it, we've got to figure out the right way to put the linings on the shoe soles.
Even in the studio, the floor is smooth, the soles can be smooth, not to mention the stickers on the run.
And here we are, sticking stickers.
You don't take shoes with scissors, you don't take them.
That's the right thing to do.
It was good for me that Mario praised my work.
I don't like that.
That's part of what we've charged for part of the day.
I told you that it's not that easy for me to be a stylist, no matter what they say.
V Needed for Speed: Run across to America.
CHI
That was a careless walk, and it came into the routine of the next morning's resting room for the rest of the class, and the neglect of the law and the neglect of the law.
But that's right, obviously you didn't want to do anything.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It was hoped that she would push Need For Speed into the new institution; the council was told that she would take a decent seat in the leadership's genre.
We've been in the middle of the war, the hero of the fight and the fight.
How often it is with NFS, in spite of what we've done.
I've been running an arcade race, but I've been spoiling it for years.
Which means it's not in my house, it's the inexplicable laziness of the lazy.
I'm good at it.
You're a hero, Jack, you're a character, you're a hero, you're a character, you're a character, you're a hero, you're a character, you're a hero, you're a character, you're a character, you're a character, you're a character, you're a character, you're a character, you're a character, you're a character, you're a character, you're a character, you're a character, you're a
You're getting into a car on a car in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York City.
You're in the middle of something.
The 10-to-a-half-a-half-a-half-a-half-a-a-half-a-a-half-a-a-half-a-a-half-a-a-half-a-a-half-a-a-half-a-a-half-a-a-half-a-a-half-
That means that the race is going along the route, and that it's going to be in the middle of the road, and it's going to be interesting.
There's no way that everything in the game is going to be the same.
It's not that you're on the same level that you're on the same level as you are on the same level that you're on the same level that you're on the same level.
And yet I still don't have an identity.
We're going to drive the car through the renegade, through the autumn suburbs, or in the snowy mountains.
And besides that, the race from the race gave life to an incomparable detail.
You're going into the storm, and you're clearly visible.
I'm sorry, but in the mountains, in the mountains, there's no way to get under a lavender.
The race is pretty good.
I've got it, but I've got it.
You're in the middle of the race; you're in the middle of the race; then you're in the middle of the race; or you're competing with one opponent.
Besides all else, you're going to run into a police station, and it's much more challenging for you to do.
The components of the police are the police.
That's just an animation, that's part of Jack's money from someone in the fight and you're gonna hit him by pressing the buttons in the office.
You're the best.
I'm sure there's less fragments than you could have done.
It's on the record that it's good for you to do it, because it's not boring; it's all of us, it's one of the charges, it's a charge for a person.
It's a model for modeling.
It's because she's no longer anything, but she's not doing anything.
You're the one who's going to have the office, you're going to be the one who's going to be in another.
And yet it's a model for the dynamic race, even though you can find people on the road.
So far, so good.
But it's because of something.
The model isn't so good.
You don't tell me that, but you don't know what you're doing in front of a collision, how your car behaves, something's wrong.
And yet in your car, your car is going to be a race.
Or she's broken.
It's not important to restart, but it's fun.
Re-starting it so that you're either out of the way or you're out of the trass, taking you to the point where it's aborted.
Five and five re-starts are available for the race.
You have done them all, you have run the race from the beginning.
It's not going to happen, it's not going to happen, but you can't do it.
And you'll learn by heart how to run the race.
The fact that the same company is often in the same company.
You're not gonna fit in.
On the other hand, you're sending a staff in one and the same line of action, and you're five, five, five, five seconds or a minute.
It drives you into the police force, like it's easy for you to drive cars crawling into cars, like you're in there, you're already doing so, that you've either got them or you've got them.
It doesn't matter if you're next to them. It's like you're right in front of your nose.
There's a lot of people there.
You're in charge, you're in charge, you're outlawed, you're outlawed, you're being overrun by the same company, you're overrun by the same person.
It's obvious at the end of the building, on the bridge, that you're going to go to the capital.
Apparently, you're looking at nothing.
The thing is, what he brings before you, he commands you to do the same, which leads to one or both of them.
I mean, it's pretty obvious that you've got a lot of interesting and interesting adrenaline, but it's so obvious that you've got a problem.
I'm sorry, because I'm going to put on a simple model in a campaign, a campaign for and out of a campaign that is so bad that you don't have a commitment to you.
It doesn't matter what I don't tell you. It's 50 million tours, race or anything else.
The idea of driving cars into a race is unusual.
You've got a gas station on the way, and your car's on it, and it's on the point that you've already got it, you've got it, you've got it.
Cars are divided by three.
The sporting facilities are for the police; the strong cars are for the sections of the police; and the super-sporters are for the equipment, by the curved mountains of the toss.
This is a race race, and you're going on the race.
You've won a policy for both medals and points, a policy for challenges and history.
We've got a car and a car and a car to take care of.
And that's why you're using the Autolog online function, which, in addition to all of this, compares you with the results of other cases, and it compares you with the results of other cases.
Behold, there is one other weakness that is hard for France; this is the interpretation of the race in the race.
You and your car are going into the subway tunnel (we'll be right) while you're running down the rails in the air (we'll be right).
Your speedometer ranges from 150 to 200 kilometers per hour (let's be sure, what's going to happen) when the subway raids you, putting your car in a pile of puzzle.
We're in charge of our company, whether we're in the police force or not, or if its agents have taken us into such a trap.
It is not the same as the same: but it is the same as the two parts of the family; it is the same as the other parts of the family.
I'm sorry about the fact that in my moments of recording, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
It's not gonna help you either.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is for a lover.
I'm going to please as much as I can, and I'm going to have the soundtrack, but I don't think a lot of people are going to buy it because of her.
Run the mess.
We could have told you that Po run is part of NFS in years.
Anyway, it's not over.
It's a curse, but be prepared for what will strike you like a spotlight.
Carl's choirs you're going to the students in the barch concert.
It's about a year before the Festival Academy Festival was set up. It's a student's day and a barrage with a campaign.
He'll present the board and the choirs.
Two concerts at the festival, 17th.
"Carlove's got a job at the festival."
"Home is included in the Chorus of the School of Education and Science; Václav Hampple, president, in the army," said Yakub Chalun, head of the office.
It's going to be a public concert of choirs, and it's going to be a 2:00 p.m. 17:00 p.m. in front of the Davice Concert.
The name Jazz Mass, the essay of a Czech jazzman, Karela Rookie, is part of the ruling.
Last night, at the house of the Vinocrades, the concert "The Students in the Barch," with choirs choirs, choir choirs of Carl's company.
The goal of the Festival Academy is the seventh day of the student and worthy of the 22nd Barchats; and to present the chorus of the chorus to the high priesthood and the people's office.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
All of this takes place under the recognition of God's glory to liberty, Lord Mayor of Prague, and Václav Hample, President of Charlove.
The festival will be held from 16 to 20 in Prague and Pardubica.
There were concerts, and there were concerts, and there were students, there were students, there were performances, and so forth.
Look at the website of the festival: www.fastaacademica.cz
EU ambassador Wizenova:
The Czechs are not friendly and skeptics on the other side.
"Lissabo's contract is under the authority of the government."
"I don't know what it's going to be."
"It takes five or six years, but it takes five or six years to stabilize, and it's going to go down and all of the police are going to play the role," U.S. ambassador Milena Wizenova, at the faculty's faculty.
She's proved to be the motto of "Clarity and Desire" in the same part of the government, where she described the EU's commitment and it was so simple and straightforward that the lecturers of the KU faculty would be envied.
So, Vicinova commended the new office of the police, Herman Van Rompei:
"At first, the critics said he was a gray ball, he didn't have any role; I'm telling you, everyone's hurt, he did well with the role."
"He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he
She's done her job on the board and on the board of the board, like, "This is the union, this is the union, this is the number I've been asked to do," which is, how do you do in the country and in the country's office, such as China or the country.
We don't have our friends.
It goes on to rely on the EU's leadership, the EU's leadership, the EU's leadership, and the EU's leadership.
She called it Czechia last year.
The Czechs have taken action against the country, and they have overcame the country and the country for the partnership.
She said that the resignation was a large security officer.
The Czech Republic is in the EU.
As the ambassador said, both the Episodeo and the U.S.A. will be in the middle of the breeze.
In addition, there are seven sevenths of the EU's budget, which is not easy to do, with the budget.
Whether the budget will be the same as the budget, or the budget, the budget will be given to the government; the budget will be greater, and the budget will be smaller; all the budget will be in the country.
She brought her ambassador to Brussels, "Oshma, I understand."
"No words, no jargon, no words, no jargon, no words.
How can they understand that there are people who don't have a cricket or a bunch of cucumbers, bananas, or something to do with our paintings?
It's about the EU and more Czechs in the EU.
Multi-speed Europe -- our mission
The ambassador, that the Czechs are skeptics of the Czech Republic; but the people who have done the work, not the actions.
She wants to, more Czech than the Czech Republic.
She's the one who's in charge: the modesty of our officers and their motive for writing.
She's in charge of the Czech Republic, and she's in charge of and out of the Vishegrad Church.
"Believe that I impress someone out of and out, and to us a Slovak, a Frenchman next to a man says, "Hey, according to the police, Vishegrad General?" and he's not happy at all.
It's mostly the rules for the public.
It's not a high-speed, it's not a high-speed, it's not a high-speed, it's not a high-speed, it's a high-speed, it's a high-speed, it's a high-speed, it's a high-speed, it's a low-speed, it's a low
"We've got both the people and the people of the zone."
"We have a Schengen zone, and we already have a cooper's company."
"At first it was said that men, men, men, men, men, men like men who are not men, can be put in custody."
"The number of such forces will be reduced; it will be a fast-facing Europe," by Vicenova.
She's part of both the police and Herman Van Rompey's role in the rules, all of the law, all of the EU, all of the EU, all of the civil servants, not all of the people who enter the Fasconian.

IBM innovator in the first century of the day.
Someone's gonna want to find the word, they're gonna kill IMB, they're gonna kill me, they're gonna be "the most important."
IBM is a symbol of the IBM; the IBM is a symbol of the IBM, even though it was founded a hundred years ago.
Her punishment was laid down by her boss, the spokesman Thomas J. Watson the eldest.
He's got his motto in it, and he's got his motto in it, and he's got a lot of people on it.
His title, "Think!" thus became an image, and it was a figure of a giant (and his magazine, IMB, started in 1935).
That's what it was. That was what Watson built.
"For us at IBM, we're in charge of the action.
IBM's been talking about it for a hundred years, because it's the right name, even though I wasn't afraid to change everything.
For our whole hundred years, we've been told to go, to go, to go, to go, to go.
Over a hundred years, we've been on our own," says Samuel J. Palmizano on the anniversary of his anniversary.
The complex system
In the 1930s, Watson was in the same way as Batia in the Bay -- and IMB was one of the parties with the penalty, insurance against the regiment, elegant uniforms and bonuses for the parties.
It's the same as IBM's.
It's been one of the parties that's been in charge of the entire campaign, which is what's done to her.

They're acting like the legendaries of the Tadelica, i.e. the women's office, the women's office, the women's office, the women's office, and the people's office.
The architect of the company was Charles Ranlett Flint, before 1930, the Board of Directors.
Flint's the director of the competitor, Thomas J. Watson, who helped him.
Next, the founding of the IBM in the United States -- the Watson Banks Foundation -- is based on the non-scriptural nature of the policy and the validity.

IBM, as it is clear from the statement, is going to be on and off the force from knives and knives to clippings.
For Watson's purpose, the revenue doubled to the highest level, and a massive expansion of the impact on all continents is under way.

I'm going to tell you about my husband.
Yveta, you're a fool. I don't like him anymore.
Darin Richterzov (53) said it's over!
It was because her husband Joseph Richter (53) became the bodyguard and the governor of Iveta Bartoshchew (45), Darin, that he was awakening and going home.
She doesn't want to do anything, she doesn't want to do it anymore, and she's defined the rules for doing it.
"Pep must return home, but no longer as my partner," Rykhtarzow.
Darin Richterzow's in the summer in her house is the blood of Bartoshzew, and she, she, in fact, has not taken any note of what she has to do with her marriage.
And even though she forced Yveta to come from Rzycán for 30 hours, Pepa didn't have a song.
He's mad that he loves her.
By some means Darin surrendered, a form that had humbled her husband's affair: and now she had forgiven him.
The archive doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even Richter and Barthosov will fail, and his wife will not take him out of the way.
He'll want to spend his days in your house, and he won't throw him out.
He said, "But he's not like me, he's like me, he's like me, he's like me, he's like me, he's like me, he's like me, he's like me, he's like me, he's like me, he's like me, he's not like me, he's like me, he's like me, but he's like me, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, "He's likes me, he's not like me, he's like me, he's like, he's like, "He's like, "He's like, he's like, he's like, "he's like, he's like, "he's like, "he's like, he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's" "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's" "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's" and "he's like, "he's" and "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's like, "he's "he's "he's like, "he's "he's "he's like, "he's "he's" "he's "he's" and "he's" and "he's "he's" and "he's "he's like, "he's "he's" and "he's "he's "he's "he's "he's "he's" "he's "he's like, "he's "he's "he's "he's "he's "he's" "he's "he's "he's" "he's "he's "he's "he's "he's "he's "he's "he's like, "he's "he's" and "he's "he's" "he's" "he's "he's "he's "he's "he's "he's "he'
Not until Joseph objected to his wife's displeasing him.
"I respect your dignity."
"I'll be with Yveta, I won't change it."
"My wife has married her marriage on board, and I respect it."
"Our alliance in the United States; I'm taking care of repairs, garden, house and boot shops."
"Darina and I are normal, because we're not splitting anymore," said the Richter of Black magazine.
He's the one who won't be able to take him.
"We don't sleep, and I don't care who she's going to, who she's with, who she's a friend with, who she's a friend with.
I know it's my fault, I'm staying in Yveta and I'm carrying you, Joseph Joseph.
I'm sorry, Cass, do you have any of you?
You're asking men to kill them all.
Dear ladies, you're in the middle of the day, you're in the middle of the day, you're in the middle of a lot of bad luck, you're making men angry?
Shophopper's
Your half regret that you're shopping?
Have you ever been treated as one?
Do you need to buy a sale shop?
Yes, so your boots can get a bad hold on you.
They admit that they've somehow made their way to the schoppers.
And yet, who of you will refuse to go shopping in the house sitting in the seat and taking her (preferably, in the company of the people) into the office?
You know, shoppers and hobbies for men, but for men, it's going to be a living hell.
Just leave me alone, this time you've been talking to half of you...
You've got to go.
"Am I crazy?"
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry." "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"Are you still coming to me?"
Did you hear the phrases?
Yeah?
You enter the office, in the form of an official.
Not for you, but many men are literally allergic to a partner's partner for their species.
The more the police, the more the police, the more they're being harassed.
The importance of good order and cleanliness
It's like an endless story.

You're criticizing your partner's partner for attacking the cafeteria in his boots; behind the mud in the sink and the window of the glass in the living room, did you clean it up like that?
And that in order and cleanliness, there is no standing on the front.
It's harmless to clean up your lives, and it's good for you.
Teams are on the road.
"Brown into the basket."
"You'll wear your socks tomorrow?"
"The washing towels don't lie on the floor."
You've done it to your partner once a day, and he's got to say it's annoying.
You've got it, you've got it, you've got it, you've got it, you've got it, you've got it.
If you'd understood it, you wouldn't have done so many commands so often.

He said, "You've got him."
"I don't want to say he's a league, but he definitely goes into the three," said the Yagr, commending him.
I didn't think I'd end up with a hockey guy like him.
"I'm sorry."
"I want him."
"Everything in the NCH is my duty, and my duty has come, "for Jagr.

Evolution of prices of prices since 1989
By 1989 there were five and a half agencies in Czechoslovakia: ❑edok,porturist, CKM, Rekrea, and Autotourist.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Thus, on the Czech Sea, tourists traveled to German Democratic Republic; the Federal Union (Sochi, Krum on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both on the Black Sea); and Wengxia (Balaton).
We were forced into Yugoslavia from 1962 to 1972, and then the Yugoslavian regime returned to the state, which, by the way, was taken by the Czech regime to Yugoslavia.
The paradox of socialization was that the social groups of the bloc (i.e. and Czechoslovakia) did not approve of social action.
The Czechoslovakia party wanted to take it on its own, to the Soviet Union or to Poland, was written, received from the Czechoslovakia; in the Czech Republic, was the case.
There was an agency to go to the hospital, but it was either standing in the room all night, sleeping with a sleeping bag, or "good company" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Currency was an excuse to go to prison. He wasn't handed over to untrusted people, he wasn't given out.
The Czechoslovak currency was not an envelope envelope; without the currency, it was the currency of the currency (the currency) for the country.
More often the Czechs conducted their own house, which led to the formation of cottages and summer houses, and to this day's work.
The 1989 tourism industry in the Czech Republic has thus survived the revolution.
That's how up to 1989 the GDR or GDR was the culmination of our troops, and in the year the Czechs spent 4.5 billion in the Peace Council.
It's a great paradox that we don't think we can do much more, that by 1989 we couldn't have enjoyed the popularity of Croatia in Croatia, and that it was a success.
In the 1990s, a visa was obtained from the police, which led to the establishment of a short strike, mostly in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakia couldn't have satisfied themselves with the plan.
In Paris, tourists slept in tents in parks in tents, because they didn't go to a hotel or Mr. Pilgrims.
The type of Czech figure in that area was to bring food (conserves, salami, etc.) to the office of the government.
In the middle of the moment, we have an envelope with a cup of crowns, and then our tourists can take the Western currency.
Our income and income went up, which in 1997 led to another important action.
Since 1997, the demand for the Flight agencies has been for the charter of the airlines, and since 1997, the Flights have become cheaper for the opts.
By the 1990s, the Czechs didn't need a visa for all of the nations, the U.S.A., that's why we're doing it.
The demand for the first direct charter flight from the government's office in France, is demanded.
Flights have since been chartered by the Czech regime to the Czech regime in the city of Benzo. This winter flight from the State will be held on the basis of the Russians.
I've got 100 Czechs for about a year.
And there's just one figure that symbolizes our leadership in 2008, and that's what we're doing.
From 17 to 20, 2008, U.S.A. issued a visa for Czech officers.
The Czechs spent more than 50.3 percent in 2008, and the Czechs spent 15 percent of the crowns in the country for the purpose of taking them into custody.
The president's office, the father of the police.
There was no president in Czech football. It was a risk that Mr. Haszek's head of the Czech football team (FAהR) would not be named as the only extraordinary official in Nimburke.
There's no point in the rules of procedure.
Not without a charge for one of them.
Yinrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomasz Paclik are thirsting for a ride to establish Czech football.
Goszek left his post in Paris.
No matter what, the Era of Haszeka has loaded football in the midst of the war against the head of the Houses, they can't identify a candidate.
It became obvious to 16 men, and it was the new president.
The delegates were sent to the house of House in Prague, Smishov, the delegates were not allowed to go.

"The dispute is whether to set standards or find a model," says one of the Presidents of the FAṛR, Dushan Freedom, who is the winner of football in the United States.
By decree, by decree, the steward of the third, the candidate, the leader of that institution, he is the candidate.
Moravia is determined to defend a candidate with a candidate with a number of votes in the Houses of the Republic.
On the other hand, at least two thirds of the vote in the percentage of the donor per vote.
"That's not the case, the two parties would have taken their place; that would have made the whole of the House," "Freedom with Moravia's arguments, "he says that it would have been impossible for the rules and rules to be out of the rules and standards.
Tomasz Paclik is with him, although by the rules of the law, by the statutes, they're telling Pelt more than the other officers.
"I'd like to, I'd like to do as much as I can."
"I want to do all the foolishness of foolishness like on the inside," says the director of the capital of Plzen, who is a candidate; and in the company of them, he's mostly Pelette.
Pelta's a pellet.
He said that the president would be in Nimburke; he said he was in charge.
"Every bro's going to be a champion of the Champion of the Champion."
"Futball will be on board, people will be willing," says Captain Applentz.
Richle's holding back.
"I'm on it, but it's not clear."
"I don't have God and Moravia, but I have rules."
"It's only one and only one of the officers."
"I'm going to kill you," said Reichle.
There's not a lot of interest in getting it done.
I'm in charge, I'm in charge, but I'm sure you'll be in charge of a soccer game before the match.
In addition to the others, Presidents Dalir Kucher and Reich in Podhorse, you didn't take Prague from the morning because of the company's presence.

I'd like to see the opponents in the presence of a strong sports force in the country.
They're on the stake: individuals; lenders; football; and directors of the Czech Republic for Sazki's problems.
Paclik's in the presidential office, because he's not a candidate.
Head of football player Plzen Tomasz Paclik would be a strong candidate, as he would have his lead to President Football Committee (FAåR), he would not have claimed to take office.
"If I were a candidate, I'd fight for him and I wouldn't fight for him myself."
"But I haven't done it yet," said Paclik ▸TK.
Pazlik's motive for working with Mirosław Pelta and Yinrich Reichel is in Pelatet, the Favorite of the Bar, the FAṛR.
So, Paclik, he's president of the Republic by the year 2013 and he's president of the Republic.
He'd like to, he'd want to, he'd want to be a top manager, he wouldn't have a football drive.
"I've spoken to the people, I'd have thought about it."
"For me, it was a terrible experience, as most of them said, at the moment, they didn't have to go to Czech football."
"I'd like to say it," he said.
Burb is the rival, chased behind the sculptures like a lobbyist, taking a vote at the President's office.
Paczlik, so this is Pelta, and Pelt became president.
"He's gonna win, he's gonna win, he's gonna win, he's gonna win, he's gonna win a no-go folder, and football won't go forward."
"Berbra's company, a capable man, that would be a big deal for football," said Paclik.
He hints at the fact that the name of Pelta was recorded in the cell phone record in the custody of the cell phones in the custody of the police; Peltet succeeded.
"I don't know, the prestige of Pelta's prestige would bring football."
"And how we'd get into UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, and he's no longer in custody of the report that he's going to sell the club Plzen, and Pelt will be president.
Paczlik wins Thursday, he could've checked with Pelta at the party.
It's a candidate, Reichle, Paclik before the hospital, and it's a fiasco.
"None (Pelta) would have been someone I'd talk to."
You're crazy.
"I can put it in the bathroom."
"But he didn't do it."
"I don't put my nose into anything I don't believe in either," said Paclik, who took the lead in the campaign, the team leader of the team, named Ludek Machela, named Dagmar Damkov.
I'm afraid he'll risk it.
He led the Plzy team in summer, and with him celebrated in May her three triumphs in the league.
"I've got a job, I've got a job, I've got a job, I've got a job, I've got a job, I've got a job, I've got a job, I've got a job, I've got a job, I've got a job, I've got a job, I've
He said to Paclik, he didn't confess his antipathy, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krzetinski.
One of his responsibilities will be to bring FAṛR and Czech Republic to the country, and with him he will be a lobby for the country's lottery sports.
"One of the moments, the President."
He said, "I've done it, but I've done it, but I've done it, I've done it," he said.
Paczlik didn't do his job with the club Plzyenjki, although he did believe that President FAåRI was the president of the club.
Pelt's with the Applebearer, and Reich's with Prague Duclay.
"It's not a bad idea."
"And yet I don't see the evidence in the transfer of the Plzy club to anyone else, when I'm going to go back in six months," says Paclik.
Pelt's under the rule of FAåR, under the rule of Pat's fine.
Two days before the end of football, one of the presidents, Mirosław Pelt, who is to be elected, he'll be in charge of the FAṛR rule, in charge of the rule of law.
Till Thursday night in Nimburque, I've got a full-time full-time full-time full-time full-time full-time full-time.
He's focusing on both the institution and the government.
He's taking action in the first moment before he's gone.
"People on board have been playing soccer for a long time, and the President will be on Thursday."
He's been in Sparta for many years, and he's been working with the Yablonec club.
That's why he said he's a Frozen, who's a Czech football player.
He's the one who's got a lot of euphoria, the kings of Haszek.
"The rules, they're not as good as we all thought they were going to be."
"If we had no legal status, we'd already have a president," said Pelta.
He's going to take a copy of the document as the basis for the presentation.
"I'm going to be president, and I'm going to be the president, and I'm going to be the president, and I'm going to be the president, I'm going to be the president, and I'm going to be the president, and I'm going to be taking the lead, I'm going to be the president."
We can't do it without it, Pelt.
Besides, he says he doesn't take himself against the background.
He's already claimed that he was in charge of his case with Yinrich Reichl, who was in charge of his case; he's in support of the fact that his rival candidate would become his state president.
He didn't attack Thomas Paclik, who criticized Pelt.
"He's in football more than a year and he's in it."
"Everything that happens, his attacks have been defiled, and a lot of people have committed his pre-election campaign."
He said to Pelta about the rival, and he said that he was faithful, he said he was in France.
He's got a lot of football, from a very low-cost competition to a low-cost competition.
You've got a lot of football.
"I'd like to take care of all the cases of Bohemians or the corruption of scandal."
"At once I'd focus on negotiations both with and with the police, the funding for all football," the 40th candidate said ▸TK two weeks ago.
And then he said that he's not taking a job as a football player on a fired ticket.
It was his policy of insurance, the government's responsibility to control the perceived nervousness.
Don't go to Nimburg on Thursday, he's not going to come to Nimburg.
"How do we get to the whole round, with which we can do it?"
"Futball, he's the one who's chosen him," says Pelta, two days before the day before the day before, he's got the power of the quartermaster.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
On Thursday, Yinrich Reich, President President, will be president of the football team, who is said to be dissatisfied.
If they choose him, they'll be the best.
He wants to get a staff and a staff for football.
It deals with the Bohemians; it deals with both UEFA and FIFA; more football; and the President's President, Mr. Haszek.
"I'd like to focus on football in the United States."
"From UEFA and FIFA, to the best, the best, the right football and the right football for the people."
"That's what I don't want to tell you I'm all alone," said Reichle in the ▸TK clinic.
"I'm a commanding officer, and I want to take the lead, so I think I'm a member of the team who's focusing on the action."
"I'm the race, so I'm in the segment of the football segment forward."
"You can't tell a lot of people that it's going to be a good job, not just criticizing others," he said.
The atmosphere of criticism in the soccer team has forced him into a candidate.
"It's about me that I spend 20 hours a day."
"But I know if I have anything in me; and that I will not be put down by people who put sticks in my wheels and put them under my body," he said.
"That's not who the people told me I didn't give up, man."
"I can't do it," he said.
He says that his motivation is a job, he started with Haszek.
And I don't want to rewind it all.
"We have been able to bring them in after six years, and I don't want anyone to destroy them," he said, fearing that the candidate, Mirosław Pelta, would be the one to return to the one who was before Haszek.
"I believe in this approach, and that's what it's most unlikely to be the expert Mirek Pelta."
"I'd like to be a football player like this, because it was available to the people."
"I can do a lot of things, but I certainly can't do it."
"I'm sorry."
"I want to play football available because I'm doing a good job of running, not having a good job," said Reichle.
He claims to be the president of the Czech Republic.
"Although humans, I plan to maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it came to the League on the Czech and Moravi side, the League's office, and the League's office."
"It preempts the League to have three Moravia officers, which are for the Moravia people," said Reichle.
It's like the President's Office of the Plzen Club, Tomasz Paclik, Reich, not taking his stand for the campaign.
"Then I don't believe I'm strong in the House, and I'm the President of the House, and I see that I've reached some of them," said Richl.
He blames himself for not having a license.
Pelta was "disfellowshipped from the loan agency for Czech football," he's the second manager, Paclik, a candidate for the candidate, who's got what he's doing.
"Someone didn't know that he had a job at Plzen in the year."
"They'll pick him, "that he'll take what he started, "without a prison seat."
"She didn't want to feast for a purpose," said Richl about it.
I'm sorry
Jump in the water
Julia Stanek
Travelers can try incredible water on their own and relax the body's body in the tub and walk around the city or walk around the city.
One book tells you, you've got water.
Without one of Iris Meder's men, she couldn't take her bathing suit.
She's lying on her back in the water, she's going up with the taste of a painted dome, she's going to the marble cherubs, she's taking her to the edge of the cherubs, and she's admiring the flavor of an Ar-Nuo swimmer.
She rushed into her notebook with details about the construction and the administration.
Historian Meder's sailing at about 200 swimmers -- and this led to the formation in the recent Badefreden Bank, from Munich to Munich to a bunch of palaces in the Black Forest and the "beyond concrete beef" in Townus.
In addition to 13 countries, she took baths in France, France, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the Republic, the country, the country, the country, the country, the country, the country, and the country, and one city in Luxembourg, the country and the country.
The 46th author is an enthusiast of the stock.
She's not very good at sports, says Meder, but in the water, it's fine.
Inexperience is that the worshipers of the United States are willing to tolerate the blue cafe tile and the smell of chlorine, but as runners can be lured by the smell of the odor of the weeds or by the fermentation of the birds in the park.
"One of the things that I do is that I take myself, that I'm a swimmer, that I'm so proud of," says living in Vienna Meder.
"Yes, I'm sorry."
It's a double architecture.
Splashing oil in and oil in the sauna-- the health factor in the baths is so significant because, according to Meder's wife, the incentive is all.
And swimmers can do eye-feeding work, and they'll take on that kind of labor. "Instead of the floor in your labor."
"The surface of the world, but it's beautiful."
It's all about the ceiling, the tile, and the trams.
Illustration of "The Joy of Buy" at 190 C.E., of the value of the architectural and oasis regulations, and you're going to fall into the water.
The Collegiator of the Meder water ponds, he's giving up his staff in the United States.
She's got a lot of pediment-rich water in the carst-teast water, and she's got a teram bath bath, a water jar, in a városi Termálfordö in Yasberen, and a cheetah therapist, a 100-year-old Secheni bath in Budapest.
You can take all Zurich out of his bath on the beef or because he's snowy Arlberg at the bar in St. Anton, and in pairs of houses, you'll take you to the banquet.
Aqua-congregation in Ezthal is like UFOs that landed in the Alps.
In winter, he's got a pair of steam from the sinks, and it's a little small on the background of the Ezthal Mountains.
The Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Meder's assistant is not in the company to smell the smell of chlorine.
The baths smell like gray. The Arpád baths in Bekeshchab smell so much like you, that you're in a healthful state.
The smell of carbon monoxide in water jars, the water is black from the mud, it sticks to the skin as you get into a hospital, it's health-like.
Iris Meder, however, was disillusioned at the very first moment at the moment by the beauty of the house to buy.
The Suite, a project by Dushan Jurkovic in 1902, was executed.
Meder looked in the form of an Ar-nuo-style red-and-white style, she's making weeds, she's making a tile caffeine.
One of them was stopped by the heated moorings, a floating mooring in the Black Forest, the Palace of the Term of Water in Bad Willbad.
You're not going to find the Neo-Roman in 1844, but the Moorite Moorite Hall of the Alhampoi style, which was 1900.
In 1995, Therm's Season -- the floating figure of Iris Meder -- and not because she's from Schwarzwald.
It's like, "It's the way you're going to think about the architecture of the style," says Meder.
They're in the heat of the palace, obviously.
The heat is hot.
Deutsche the Bank of Races claims to be in charge.

Hamburg --
One, 84 percent of Germans believe that banks spear against the police, like wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of the total, the Deutsche Bank and the Bank Banks, the President of the United Nations, the President of the United Nations, and the poorer people in the world.
I'm in charge of the Fudwatch Company, the Foudwatch Company, and the Forsa Company.

The author of the report, Harald Shuman, said that the stakes on the stock of goods under the siege, and the banks, thus leading to global hunger.
Deutsche Bank Bank Joseph Ackermann's campaign against the banks of the house, even as Godman Sacks and Morgan Stanley do.
Initially, the interest rates were set as a charge against price prices.
Whatever it is, it's against the rules and regulations of the government, and it's against the authorities.
In the face of competition in the U.S., Ackermann is critical, and he's critical, and he's the one who's saying, "I don't know if I'm at risk with Deutsche Bank."
In the case of SPIEGEL ONLINE, it's a racial complaint, as reported in the Foodwatch report.
We're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're done, we're gonna go, we're done.
The head of the bank is in charge, he's in charge at the end.
I'll take the goods, or I'll take the goods, or I'll take the goods.
Ackermann's over my DJ.
President Faudwatch Tilo Bode gives news to the sector.
Like a bank lobby at Ackermann's bank, there's a very good idea, Bode.
"Daughter Bank" said Bode.
It doesn't matter whether it's about starving people or Deutsche Bank.
Quick to Ackermann's office, but the director would like to make sure that he's safe before he's taken to the company.
Deutsche Bank's invaded that they wouldn't move into the Council of Rights, as they did.

21st House in Vienna
The new hotel pavilion
Ingeborg Dzheowski
The palace of 1958 for the city of 1958 in the conquest of the city of Vienna became a castle in Vienna, a desert and was abandoned.
Now he's acting like the center of the center.
The Pavilion of Charlemagne, a project by Karl Schwanzer for 1958 in the United States, a project by Karl Szvanzer to deal with his shapes, a glass of Halls, boldly take the authorities into custody.
The Svantzer Pavilion conquered the Grand Prix in architecture in 1958 for its light steaming cockpit of steel and steel.
It's a milestone in architecture.
It's so bad that he's in charge of the building at the exhibition.
At the end of the year, he glorified the world in 1973 as the legend of the legendary Nazilinera Tower of BMW and its officers in the cup.
The Pavilion, the design of the exhibitions, was transferred to the Swiss Garden at the U.S. station station in Paris, to the Museum of 20th century in 1962, and often as the House of the 20th century.
Anyway, it wasn't suitable for the museum for both the museums and the museums -- it had no walls, it could have been on board, it could have been on board, and it could have been a condiment.
But it's not until we've got a house in Vienna.
The house has been empty since 2001, and it's got a lot of trouble.
Architecture Adolf Krishanitz is the one who was called the 21st House and will be the museum of the museum.
The museum is the Museum of the Museum of Belveder, and the exhibition is in the middle of the night.
She became the director of the Austrian Gallery of the Belveder Gallery in 2007, with a new beginning.
Khussleyn-Arco, professor of the Department of Social Security in Youth, Sotheby's office, Huggenheim and in France, founder and director of the Saltzburg Museum of Defamation, and director of the Recognance Museum, and director of the Office of the President of the Office and the Office of the Secretary of the Secretary of State and the Office of the Secretary of the Secretary of State.
The museum was in Fresti Wattruba, a cafe and a bookstore with a name.
strict control of the & budget
Krishanitz was a perfect candidate for the case.
He was the restorer of the Venesian Secezionion, and the winner of the competition, Joseph Olbrich, but he went to Svantzer in Wetser, and the pavilion was for him "excluded," and he said, "almost recently."
He knew the design, and he knew the design, and he was standing in front of the arts, and he was already a part of greatness and ease, and he was transferred to Vienna and Odeo.
It was a "swallower of the house," says Crishanitz.
Oxyphilus on the glass facade of Paris, was inserted with fibrous fiber, and the glass ceiling was placed with the facade.
Translate the heat of the bridge, or the heat bridge, and the ceilings were removed from the ceiling.
Two lower levels for the new unit, a fallen well and a low base for the new office, but the shvanzer's graceful pavilion.
The original door of the door was painted in the red-black edge of corrodation.
Hall Cilitheater is the same as she was.
It's all under strict control of the museum department and with a budget.
"We often find ourselves found, we've been good, cheap, and we'd be a museum company," says Krishanitz, hoping for a rough floor in the company.
I'm going to have to take care of them and their lungs, take care of them, take care of them, take care of them, take care of them, take care of them.
Creshanitz recently, that the Brussels pavilion was a character -- type of the word "clap into the city."
The architecture of "not always on the floor" and the subject doesn't want "stimulation" at all.
The 21st House is on the right side of the city, and the city's city is being rebuilt by the train station, with the Swiss Garden.
The 21st House is under Krishanittz's leadership.
Deutsche Bahn a lot of winter-winter anti-feet packet

The same is true for Citigroup, 20.5 percent.

The governor, the bank and the headquarters in Frankfurt, took charge of the "many" charges, but he didn't make a mistake.
Deutsche Bank has acted as a non-self-conscientific and non-consensual case against them.
Warren Buffett contributed 10 to IBM.
Buffet's dear guru actively invests in IBM.
He bought ten cents.
To this day Warren Buffet claimed that it was not an investment in computers and I.T. companies, that it was hard to predict them.
However, IBM's opinion of his position in the country.
According to Buffet, he was aware that IBM was in the company of the stock manager and was buying a computer for other companies.
Warren Buffett was considered to be a knight's cause.
IBM, an IBM veteran, became the title "Sir IBM."
In the U.S. CNBC Business Channel, Buffet Bayffet, that he's with IBM on 10.7 percent.
His favored Berkshire Hathaway holdup became one of the IBM keepers at a rate of 5.5 percent.
Buffet said that IBM didn't know about him before he was here.
He commended management, managed to get the staff in charge.
Buffet said, in the sense of management.
IBM's income was on ITM services, such as data centers.
Founder of the computer unit, has been more than 100 years old, has been responsible for all that power and power for the company.
Until now, Buffett's in the office.
He told me that the investment was in what he was doing.
And the investment, and the transportation, and the transportation, and the maintenance and engineering.

Inevitable
The Tswickau Cells have become the law in the United States.
One of the newspapers is talking about "bloodmania," and one of the newspapers is looking at the party.
The murder of eight tenths and one hundredth of the population of 2000 and 2006 was a result of the right-wing opposition.
Fear and fear have reacted to this in both the United States and the German-German community.
Many of the Turks in the United States have long been in fear for their fears. The right-wing extremist actions against the Turks were not with the regime of the people in Mellena in 1992, and in Zogen in May 1993.
I don't know, but it's not that it's a bad thing, that it's a bad thing.
However, the right-wing extremist is on such a scale, not at all.
It was the headline of the Haberturk newspaper.
The newspaper Sabah, with the police, that one of them was the real steward of the secret of the services, and that the German authorities could get into the right-wing extremist mud swamp.
The Turkish community in the United Nations (TGD)dea, remembering the victims of the State, were silently speaking with a picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate to France.
Two hundred years ago, the Turkish community took the lead in the engagement of the German-German-Green State.
It was presented in a positive form -- like a story.
It was like a slap. "A gift from a gift on a payoff" is one of the articles on the "Haber X" National Portal, comment by the President.
The Germans of Huriyet didn't miss it either.
It's a column of Ahmet Kulahji.
He said that they were people who paid taxes and contributed to the stock.
I've been raided and raided on the German-named Info-forums.
They're asking, the German authorities didn't think about what they wanted to do in the right-wing extremist circles.
They've reached the realm of rhetoric. "They're just as clumsy, there's no other action, there's no other action, there's no other action."
"It will be self-defendant."
"The peace of the world is greatly different from how everything will be done and how it will be done," says Selen.
In the '90s, it's very clear that peace is under siege.
Photographs of the ruins of Zoo's ruins were captured in the slaughter of Germans and Turks.
It didn't reveal to the turks so clearly that they're on the floor, and to their own people, that distrust and stoutness can really turn into reality.
The turks, however, are the turks.
You don't know what I'm doing.
The Turkish press in that office was in the very image of the German regime of the government. Helmut Kolka was the survivor of Mellin.
He sent a telegraph to the President of the Republic of Zozen, but at the memorial in Cologne, he sent a telegraph to the President of the Republic of the Republic of Zogenen, but at the memorial to the residence in Cologne, his professor of the business of Klaus Quinkel-Kinkel-Kinkel in a tax charge, and the Turks pay to you,
He pays the price.
Nowadays, the evidence shows how the mistrust of many of the Turks by Germany's Germany's people has grown ever since.
I've clearly shown that there is no exception to the establishment and establishment of the rights-based extremists in the country.
The bank scandal on Lake Zurich
The risk of a bank is not in the bank or in the bank, but in the country.
UBS is not going bankrupt and has been fighting this one and the other with no respect ever since.
I'll take him to the German course.
Alex Weber didn't know he'd get a role.
In 2013 he was under the leadership of the Federal Bank, and in 2013 he was under the leadership of the Governor of the Federal Bank of UBS; he was the head of the federal bank of UBS; he was the head of the capital; he was the head of the capital; he was the head of the capital.
Alex Weber was obviously thrilled, commending Switzerland for her, UBS for getting a job and a job for his colleagues.
"UBS managed to make a statement."
"I'm looking for an investigation with Caspar Philliger and Oswald Groebel."
But it's already clear in France that everything will be in the same way.
The UBS trader went over the bank's bank and went over 1.7 percent of the bank.
The UBS director, Osvald Groebel, is a banker who's not in the country, he's not in the country, he's in the country.
Since then, the UBS Department has been in charge of the UBS, and everyone knows, "If Alex Weber is going to take up his post, will he?
Weber's been a bank since the year 2012.
And as a bank in France, he'll take office in May, not in 2013.
It's not going to be easy for Alex Webber.
He's a professor at the Central Bank and not a banker at the Central Bank, and he's got an application.
He's suddenly behind the bank, and he's proved once and for a time that he's long deserved from "the President of the scandal in the United States."
The UBS, on the one hand, is -- until the other, he's in charge of the assets in the company, and with the other, he doesn't get out of scandal.
That a proud bank doesn't spare anything.
It's all over the place.
By 2007 UBS had been invasive.
The bank had an image of the money and the money, but at the same time, it had a very sloppy asset with the assets and assets of the bank, and it was going to become the stockholder in the bank.
In 2007, UBS managed 1.6 percent, so it had more money in it than the bank in it,
And at the bank, they're in the League of Peace Banks.
That's a good idea.
Hans Geiger, a banker and professor of business who has long been involved in Zurich's office, said, "I led UBS students as a bank."
"Knowing what we are, you can do as I could have been so wrong."
He made a mistake.
In 2007, it became clear that something was wrong with UBS.
Director Peter Wuffley, who's the one who's given an identity to Civil and, at the same time, to a banker, he resigned from his post.
He's gone.
Invest in the bank's capital was on a substandard basis, and it was from the bank.
Believe me, I'm not, but UBS is on the 13th floor, you're in charge.
The bank is going to find the bank -- but the banker's banker's office recently, one of the non-transparent funds from Singapore and one fund from Singapore, which is not owned by the bank.
It was a blow.
Everything got worse in 2008 and it's gone bad.
The bank took action on the death penalty, and Marseilles Ospel took action on the salary of the office in 2006 and resigned.
In 2008, there was a disaster.
The UBS has been poisoned by the bank by the unnamed UBS, and the Swiss bank of the Confederate has paid six percent for the envelope of the Envelope with the Envelope Envelope, to become with the bank.
The whole thing was in shock. It was a drama of what banks were going to be in the hospital.
Finally, the balance sheet of UBS in 2007 was five times greater than the total population (see figure).
"I don't want to save UBS at least once," says banker .
There's been a disaster.
The UBS captain in the U.S. and the U.S.
The UBS pays 780 employees for the cost, for the cost of expenses plus fines.
The UBS, therefore, is either an individual or an individual, which was a violation of the policy.
In the same way, UBS will destroy what was his name in the wards of the prison, the veil of secrecy.
It was no longer the same as it was.
The director of the office and the office of the officer of the office of the officer of the office of the officer of the office of the officer of the office of the
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The bank's going to take action against the police for the sake of the speculators and the assets in the custody and denials.
And everything went well and it became clear that UBS was able to break the deal, as a crash happened with a treacherous treacher, and one and a half of the trader dropped 1.7.9 percent of the stock that was at the bank of France, that something was wrong.
One thing's clear is that you haven't done your job yet.
"The Adoboli incident clearly stated that the control of the risks is the case," says Martin Jansen, professor of the department and the office in the Swiss Council of the Church of Zurich.
The executive director of one of the German banks also doesn't say, "The UBS problem is that he doesn't have a risk control policy."
It's not a risk to the bankers of the world's assets, but it's not a risk to the company, it's not a matter of whether it's the Alps' peace or not.
The Safeguards of Banks have become a symbol of the unscriptural nature, as Lindt and Springli symbolize the sophisticated taste of chocolate.
The UBS apartment in Zurich is still an image of a decent bank bank, much more than that.
She's a classic.
The main bank of the Bank of Zurich in Banzofststess, leading from the station station to Lake Zurich, in the snow of the caps of mountains.

Mr. Unglund's book is from the book.
It's also an adjustment to the statement that the Treaty of Peace was a major trenches on the front.
"Beauty and Grief" is the panorama of other theaters of the United Nations: the Alps, the Balkans, the front, Mesopotamia, Africa.
Soldiers are in charge of hives; one of them puts the Tsetse flies under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is the Tsetse flies.
It's a book from the beginning.
The war against all humans is like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smells like dustless dust.
You're not far away from the canon, and you're going to stay in the bar or in the bar, and you're going to stay in the bar or in the bar?
So, or is that what you're talking about?
You don't know that you have to go and take care of yourself.
Mr. Englund's Deficiency, the "complete of guesses, guesses, figures, fears, enticements, plots, plots, whims, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Pilgrimage" has been the product of people like Florence Farmborough, a nurse in a Russian firm, and Richard Stumpf, sailor of the German Navy at sea.
It's mostly from memoirs, letters, and other applications.
The evidence of their lives can be frightening or frightening, but they are in the midst of Mr. England's moments and details.
Of them are of them many, and of how they will be dealt with.
He says, "Erzaz, who is an erzaz."
"Superiorcoff, forged caffeine, inexorable rubber, bandages, bullies."
He's working on an erzz food in France.
It's about "a meat of pressed rice boiled in a bar full of fat (and a decorated fake to a tree; a tobacco carving from a land root and a dried lantern; a carving a tree."
He said, "837 of the contestants, the wrinkles, 511 of the coffee players."
It's about honor and courage.
One U.S. man has a sense of passion and says, "You know, at the end of the line, that's what, at the end of the line, that's for you, and not for you in the comfort of a cigarette and whiskey chair, an evening newspaper or a bestseller and a story, that the display of the show and the presence of the civilisation and the underside of a piece of rubbish with a pair of sticks is not a barbaric."
Soldiers, soldiers, soldiers, that he, in fact, is not going to or won't go or go.
He writes, "I'm sorry about the self-sacrificing scheme, he'd love to know that this is in front of the leprosy,"
But it's a frighteningly like "convicted, hung in secret."
It's about fear, fear, and fear.
"The conflict is becoming more and more competitive," writes Mr. Englund, "the war factories."
He notices the coming of someone who is "a new species of bestiary beginning with the beginning of the book: the beautiful and the well-dressed suit of the finely-dressed crew, the carnage of the carnage, sitting at the writing table."
In the same way, the low level of action, heroism.
Mr. Anglund about soldiers, he's gonna catch a venereal gang from prostitutes, he's gonna take a stand on the front.
He writes, "The greatest mass of all things can be found in Gonorrhea dwarfs, bought by buyers and sold in their genitals in France,"
"A lot of people have rubbed him into prison, which has often led to the Bayteh."
Translated with Swedish Peter Graves, Mr. Anglind's proses is flexible but non-negotiable, beautifully suited for his humanist.

People are on the move, and they're on the move.
Paul Fascel's book on the I.K. is often indirect, like "The Great Harvest and the Sacrifice" by Paul Fascel or the novel novel, like "The Front Without a Defense" by Erich-Marie Remarque, not by the authorities.
Mr. Englund's book is part of a non-pattern pantheon.
His book is the best I can do in the least.
I won't do it.
But it's out of the book that he's going to go to a list of characters, you're taking it out of your hands, and you're burning your spaghetti.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You've got hundreds of men in the army, you've got hundreds in the police station.

There was no mention of a repetition of such acts as pepper gas against protest, which were governed by the rules of the government and the hurricane of favoritism for the occupation.

The authorities were preparing themselves, as they were in other cities.
You've got to take the anti-couple against the cellals with the Zukotta.
The authorities have taken such training to the counter-action of the measures taken by the Lower Manhattan.

For reasons of secrecy, there was a lesson, a lesson in town.
The 14th power cleans the park, but they put them in front of hundreds of protesters, slammed them in front of the police, told them about the plans.
I'm in charge of the police, I'm in charge of the district, I'm in charge of the police, I'm in charge of the authorities.
Mr. Kelly said that they were humans, as if they were at work, moving and moving out of the park in the middle of the day, that they spent 1 o'clock in the night for the people.
He said, "That was the right thing to do, in a park with a lot of people," he said.
Cars with searchlights and spokesmen, at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, outside the Manhattan Bridge, just to go ahead.

The main protest is in front of the kitchen in the center of the park.
You have brought barricades, and the police have entered, and have committed them.

But on Facebook, that the site is following them, whether it's in the Scrabble and a friend's office, and it's miles from you, the website of the government.
But how do you know you didn't tell Facebook to do anything about it?
It's like you've got a very strict offline, online, online.
"I don't think that even though they've been told that the payer is behind them," says Neil Selwyn, who's from the knowledge board, about who he was in 2006 with the students on Facebook.
"The people who imagined it, it was theirs and theirs."
I'm sorry about that.
Even offline, there's no evidence that it's honest.
On Facebook, I'm on Facebook, I'm on a profiler's office, and I'm on a police station.
"What you say on Facebook, and what you're looking for Facebook, are two absolutely absolute accounts," says Selwyn.
That's what the notebook and the pen are, and the notebook, and the pen, of those who can be executed.
He says, "Nothing will bring peace and peace to the world, and to the affairs of men."
"I'm afraid that one of them is the other, and the other part of the whole thing is offline."
Anders Bering Breywick will appear before the court.
Anders Bering Bravik, who confessed to being a member of the army, took 77 men in the summer, described himself as an enemy combater in the first state in the Oslo court.
"I lead the Commander of the Norwegian Police and the Knights of Tampler Bay," in front of 500 people in the audience.
"I'm the judge, because you've taken your liability from the law, from the offense of hatred, and because it's a multi-culture culture."
"I admit it, but I don't admit it."
Torquiel Nesheim interrupted Bravik as a monologue, because he "did not want to take Bravik to take it as a route for the company."
The same thing he did to Bravik, and he brought with him a written statement, to take the victims at the end of the statement.
Nesheim told him to keep Bravik under 12 men, to give him access to the police at 12 men's office, and he said that the authorities would take strict control of all the police and the correspondence at the office.
About 30 survivors and victims.
He's under the lock.
I've been trying to find someone on my behalf.
"I thought he'd be cold and cold" -- the Norwegian NRK channel was one of the survivors on Utoya.
"It wasn't comfortable, but it made me feel bad about how I was going and how I was going."
Dressed in a dark suit and Bravik's blue brace, he's going to take and take and take and hold the people and the survivors, he's going to take and you're going out of the business.
He didn't go to Brevik's country to say that he was opposed, and the Council ruled that he wasn't opposed, and said that there was no evidence that he was with the lawsuits.
It's hard to say that the 22th attack is against one extremist, not radical.
But it doesn't hurt the grief and the gloom of the whole nation.
"I'd like him to act like a monster, but he's not," said the police.
"It would have been easier if it had been so."
7 hundred and seven from Steve Jobs' missionary to the theater in the United States.
The death of Steve Jobs was compared to Henry Ford, a description of the Gg as the Great Inquirer of Predestination.
But what Apple fans can do in recent years is that Apple fans are able to do the same thing in a recent institution, that they're going to do the performances at the International Center for Women, that's like a lot of creative minds in the media and in the government.
He was, of course, a designer, a forwarder and a hippie, but he was a thorough and modernizer of the government, who was the "sickness, which is 90 percent... [but] in an agreement from a great product of the price of the price."
Back in 1995, Bob Wringley set up a television series called Triumph Nerds on the arrival of a personal computer, and he's been with Jobs for hours.
By the way, it's been ten years since Jobs got kicked out of Apple, and he's been in the office of the NeXT computer account in France.
It's like part of Cringley was in the Nards, he's saying that the missing persons were missing in the transport.
The execution of Jobs' death VHS copy was in the director's garage.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
For a man who hates his hatred of the people, Jobs is uncommon to declare his own policy and strategy.
It's the thought and the thought.
In the middle of the moments, we're going to have a 10 to 15-second campaign, where Jobs is obviously going to tell us.
There's a way that Jobs's perfectionism is at the stake, because he's in the custody of Kingsley, causing him to go to the treaty or to take action.
In filmed before the police, iPods and iPhones, there's something evil going on, that Jobs has done that, like him, the police are right and wrong, and he's right.
One case of Jobs' postmortem death, but there's something hurt and hurt in Jobs, and we see that we're looking at a worthy Spectator of greatness.
He's got the same thing, and he could have done the same.
He went and said it.
The sky's a seven-year-old on the seven-month stand:
About how he studied the job:
And you said, "Oh, it's just like that."
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
That's what I did.
The job is to take the final action at Apple.
Racedly writing, often starting with the "standards" and going off the ceiling and then getting up with the "days," it's the structure, it's the structure, it's the state, it's the government's responsibility for the trifles.
About the pope's joke:
Jobs is about blue, because he's made it with Steve Wozniak, and he's got people on the phone, and he's got people on the phone.
There's been a lot of writing about it, but Jobs' euphoria is contagious in the blue box.
He went like Wozniak and Wozniak test box box, phone-automatic phone ringer, and then connect with AT&T to man until they put as much of it as possible.
"They put a half-a-half a dozen times, and you yelled at the telephone machine, and it got a minute into the phone-a-car," says Jobs with a smile.
"You're young, and all we've had is that we could build something that could have been a force for peace."
We knew all we knew, but we could have built a team, we could've built a team -- that was the lesson we learned, and I don't think Apple could have appeared without me.
Jobs took one of the famous handkerchiefs, and Wozniak and Wozniak did it, put him in the Vatican through a blue box in the middle of the night, and asked the Pope to call him, and he had the power to arrest Henry Kissinger.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
And the cold name Bill Hewlett:
At the age of 12 years, hunting for a supply of Frequentometer Frequentometer Details, he put Bill Hewlett on the phone and took him to the hospital.
They sent their 20-minute phone caller, Jobs, to Hewlett Packard.
"It was a strong force on me, "that was the company that I saw in it, "and it was my opinion of what it was and how good it was to get to it."
Jobs became one of the HP officers who visited and visited the palace of Palo Alto, and he said, "The very face of the computer."
He was carrying a suitcase, he had a little bag with a tube, and I slammed into it.
I often went to HP when I was a teenager and I used to write that paper for her.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Gobs is talking about the invention of food on the fly.
At the dawn of his day, he's making a handful of the board, one of the officers asked for his computer.
He's been working on 30 jobs on the loan, and he's been planning both the checker and the delivery.
In Apple he's on the scene, with the mouse, once I'm a computer mouse:
"I was furious... yelling at me that it would take five years [with a mouse, 300 dollars], and I was fed up, and a designer designer."
Ninety-nine hours ago we had a mouse, and we were in charge for $15, and we were trustworthy.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Before he did, Jobs had exactly foretold how he had been wrong in the form of a fight and had broken control of the action.
"Let's say you go to IBM or Xerox, because you're a copier or a printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the company, you don't have a monopoly.
The sale and marketing of it, so [that type of people] the people in it come to the market, and the people, the product, the crowds, the crowds, the crowds, the crowds out.
The genius of the product, the monopoly of the monopoly, the crowding of the people, the notion of the difference of good and good foods, is not defined by the notion of good and good foods.
That's what happened with Xerox...
Xerox could have taken care of the entire campaign.
He could have been ten times as big, maybe a Microsoft of the '90s...
They're out of the way.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You're going to race in the city, it's going to run and run.
You're talking about her intimacies.
You don't have to run the police, you don't have to run the police, the robots, or the factories.
You're going to take 5,000 of them to the hospital, and you're going to take them all...
It's all about taste, it's all about self-infecting, it's about human beings, and it's about bringing it into what you're doing.

Scalia and Thomas conspire with the opponents of the law as long as the court judges.

The attorney, the attorney, will stand before the court and will argue that the law of the U.S. government will, of course, be Paul Clement, who was the attorney general of George W. Bush's president.
Clement's company, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the top dozen, sponsored by the Federal Federal Council, long ago by the Brazilian Conservative Council.
It's a federal agency, it's a government fund, it's one of the police, it's a law, it's a federal agency.
The one sponsored was the giant Pflizer Inc., the chief of the police in charge of heavy loads.
Lunch is in Washington D.C. for hours and hours.
There's a front, a front, a front, a Harvard McConnell, a council of the French in the Senate, and an opponent of the law.

They'd be under principle 4C. They'd be under principle 4C. They'd be under the principle of principle 4C.
It's not the case that Scalia and Thomas's apparent case of Scalia and Thomas to the police in the police, as it was with the police, was a signal to the police in the army.
"It's astounded at the fact that the court is faithful to the same rules as the other courts," said Bob Edgar, president of Dela.
"The judges have scolded and reported to the Court of Justice for legal action against lawyers, the Court of Justice case."
It's all about impartiality and freedom.
Scalia and Tomas, if they're in favor of critics, they're saying that they're willing to settle cases with the federal federal government.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a conservative.
That's why, conservatives, it's in Caghan Bay, not Scalia and Thomas.

The sister of the president of Mexico is apparently on a missionary in Michoacán.

I still have.
The mayor of the PPD was killed before the warrant, and he's an Agit for Louise Maria Calderón, and he's a member of the election race for fear.
For the IR, however, no matter how much it takes in Michoacán, the reception will be given.

The extreme power of the Pentagon for the defense
Léon Panetta has set the stage in Paris in Paris, warned that the police will blow up the forces and you'll take the chain from the corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields on the battlefields and to the leadership.
The Pentagon is already in a state of climax with 450 percent of the population in the country, but it's not possible to go to the state.
The Panetta, in a letter to the French senators John McCain, Arizona, and Francis Grimham, France.
He said that the budget board and the budget office in such a way, the sequestre is responsible for 23% and many businesses.
"So strong, so thoughtless, that we're bound on shipwreck and incomplete -- you can't buy three-fourths of a ship or ship -- and bring it to other countries," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We're going to have a lot of our state officers and since it's going to be so much, we're going to have the state, the state, the state.
"These will blow up those who will destroy our company and bring them to the rescue."
He said Panetta.
"Although in Zarubeg, the police do not have a sequestre, the police will be affected by the weeds in the courts," by Panetta.
"Contracted personnel will be the one who cancels both the police and the police, the police."
"Personal personnel will be the one who will be in violation of the law and will be in violation of the law."
Two senators wrote Panetta 10 a.m. back, invited the police to join the office.
"After the sequestre in the capital will be the cause of corruption as a person."
"Stand firm for these dragons," the senators in the army in the middle of the night, and they advertised Panetta's letter.
We can live with him, and that's not what we're trying to do.
"Secvestre is the office of the police, and you're in charge."
Whether the letter of the Panetta or the President of the Senate will bring the Senate to the budget or reinforce the statement of the Pentagon against France, it will take action.
The Panetta was absolutely motivated by his actions, even though he's been in charge of the Pentagon for many years in the Senate and the White House, and he's said he's been under a lot of pressure.
I'm going to press on the police force, and I'm depressing the picture of what I'm going to do next -- with an obesity but no nucleus.
"No sailors."
"No bullets."
"I don't know how much I'm doing."
The Panetta in the State Council at the Pentagon said, "The tiger is a tiger, with barracks, with bombs and bombs without soldiers, without soldiers."
"Force, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power,
"Inside, it's the same."
In writing letters to McCaine and Heikham Panetta, Panetta spoke about how "the risk of risk is risk-taking: putting the risk on board, on board and on the charge; putting our risk in and response to the situation; and leading to the risk in the leadership."
And Panetta said that the defense forces can deal with the security forces, that they've already done the tests, and that they've already done the tests, and that they've been on the force.

How to Get On a Bet
A fugitive on the headlines of the law, and the common lies and lies of the law.
President of the Federal Republicans, Herman Kane, is involved in the election of the Presidents of the Republic, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand.
The Pennsylvania police were guilty of perjury, of murder, that a football coach who went on foot raped his men.
President Nicola Sarkozy was caught on the scene, and President Barack Obama told U.S. President Barack Obama that President Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lodge stirs up and shakes up.
Mr. New York City's attorney and Protector-exgressionist Anthony Weiner made himself a fool, denouncing his handkerchiefs, which was held out by the authorities.
John Dance's candidate for President was involved in all the frauds of the police, the harassment of the police.
And he that chewed in it shall not forget the media circus with President Bill Jen, the charge of the police against Monika Benzski at the post.
The story of fraud at a school and a police department's office.
The teachers gave the students the exams, the same thing they did.
The teachers, who teach the teachers, do evil, which lie and lie.
Are we doing this?
In one day, like a police officer, you can be lied to 10 to 200 times.
That part of it is a lie.
The second showed that unnamed people lied three times in 10 minutes to each other.
I'm trying to get a job, or I'm going to get a job. I'm going to get a job, and I'm going to get a job, and I'm going to get a job.
In front of the labor force, like, let's say, shaly, who's going to cry out, "Take!", "Take!", "Take!", "Great" is based on the State, "Sixty percent in the prestige of the country, with all-round projects, psychology and physics papers."
One of the results is the fact that the government of the city of Crete had a negative effect.
You're lying to me.
They don't stop, they stutter, they blush, they don't cry.
Don't take it out of the question that liars are hard to break up.
This is the first time that you've ever been a fighter, you're going to fight for violence, mimics, violence, and characteristics.
I've been years, I've been taking the lead in an extensive and extensive segment of knowledge of the people, and it's clear that I've been able to make it easy and easy to take it into custody in the country.
You're a liar. You're a fool. You're a self-efficient man, and you're an intuitive man.
We believe that the four-verts are lying rather than the introverts, that they are more self-thinking, that they are more like others, that married people are more likely to lie to their partners than to their unmarried partners.
We have made you a liar, a liar, a deceitful man, a deceitful man.
How do you know if anyone's lying?
Call for help, please.
It's an "awe and a fight."
That's the starting point for the action.
Prompt for posture, for posture, for voices of character.
I'd love to tell you if you knocked your feet in a normal way, because you don't have the same people, because you're knocking your feet in the countryside.
Then you'll find the deceitful and unfaithful deeds.
Treat them like beautiful flags, not deceitful flags.
Deceivers can take the upper part of their lives, they can put their feet up against the door, they can go down to the door, they can move to the front, they can change their posture in a way or they can change their posture.
They often falsify the signal of the attack, just insisting on it.
All right, let's take a look at it.
That Scott Peterson's infamous and committed suicide, that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her death on duty.
People can drive the distances in the speech, "I didn't have a relationship with the police, Miss Scouts," or I did.
I've got a note-pointed indicator of catch.
Someone's been saying, "I'm sorry," "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
It's more beautiful than a sword, and it's often a beautiful flag.
There's no magic, there's no magic, there's no lie, but you can be deceived.
The mind will raise the mind to the point that you will not become a swindler in both men and women.
The U.S. Department of the United States Department of the United States Department of Human Rights has planned a joint plan to escort him to the U.S.
And the way that Obama took the lead from the city to the Gulf of Mexico -- he summoned the guards, but he summoned the prisoners -- the company, the escort, the fact that she willingly invaded the project, the management of the project over it.
TransCanada at night, that she'll remove the complete escort from Nebraska Pessac Pessac Hill and make sure that the project is still valid.
It sounded like it at a press conference in the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanadah Company Alex Purbas says that the company's idea is that she's in charge of the wire, even though she's on another route.
It's going to put the project on hold until he learns the route, the Nebraska Sand Hill region, and the Ogahala Aquifer, a good supply of supplies.
"Go ahead," said Fox Newsman Lee Terry, a Nebraska citizen.
The government's orders, ordered by the Department of General's Department, are essentially going to push the police down to 2013 and it's going to go back in the year, although the authorities were in charge that they were in charge.

Patty LaBelle was sued for taking a nausea out of fear.
From New York City, that the disco-demo of Patty LaBell had a buffalo in the lobby of their house in Manhattan, frightened them a little to the point that it vomited out of fear.
Tirada under the Lady Marmalade, 18th Geneviève Gusu Monk, so strongly that she endured "the wrestling, the dreaming" and "the fear of the uninformed people," says her Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It's a 10-per-cent wage, Kevin Monk, his wife, a gardener, Rosanna, and Geneviève Chaia took the land.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk came down in the lobby at the Riverside Boulevard with their luggage carrying Geneviève.
Rosanna Monk told me that she was lying on the door and she dropped her daughter's face on the floor for a moment.
"I said yes and took her," she said.
LaBell's angry with the reprimand.
She said to Rosanna Monk, "You weren't the one who was at the door."
"I said to her, "I don't know what you're doing or what you're doing."
She's going to swear, and she's going to swear, the word for C and the word for F, the word for F, the word for tones...
She's got a squirrel, and she's going to pour water out of the squirrel on me.
She said Genevieve had a hysteria.
"I said to my mother, "I said to her, "Keep me out of this," said the mother to her.
LaBell attacked her mother -- and she kept Genevieve Gueva -- and her delinquent wife and her car in charge of the car, said Rosanna Monk.
She cried so much that she vomited, she cried.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry.
The lawyer and Ms. LaBell are not on the job.
I'm not looking for anyone, but the lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken this action and that he had made a donation to the office, to the office, to the property, to the property, to cancer.
"The purpose is to punish Patty LaBell for his offense," said Davis.
"That's what I'm doing, and I'm going to go to the 18-year-old teacher of the garden of the house with 18-years in my arms."

On the same day, 998, the Supreme Court of Justice (FRY) ruled on the state, the State's "non-government" and called the state's vote on the state on the country, because it does not have the right to "permit or destroy them."

Besides, the vote in all the urns on the board of the body of the body is that the candidate-sovereign candidate of the staff and the subject of who's in the staff, or at least one percent, in the case of who's in charge of the office and/or who's in charge of the office, the president has been put out of the office.

The U.S. government's campaign to celebrate the 19th and 20th anniversary of the American national stand-by in the United States.
On that day, you've been on the State Department, since 7:30 p.m., working with a team from Los Angeles The X and Las Roberts.
It's a decryption, it's online in The Nation.
Do you know that you admire fans?
The trip to Costa Rica is the same for us.
It's our place in the U.S.A. and Central America, and so far everything's going well.
I've been to Costa Rica once, once in a hospital, that's what I think, and I think we've been there for a while.
We've been trying to bring our office in.
I asked for it because I didn't want it; the fans were in a lot of trouble on the nights before the concert.
What are you gonna tell your great fans?
I'm sorry that we're doing everything.
It took us about 21 years to go to Costa Rica for doing this, and we regret that we've been doing so many jobs, we've got to get over here.
He's got a lot of people at the concert, and he's like the show of the show.
Does that add a little bit to the charge?
We're in the 21st year of the show, and we're in the middle of it.
We did a show in São Paulo and we did, which brought us into the form of a concert in Costa Rica.
We're good, we're good.
We love our lives, we love us surfing and jungle, that we love ourselves, Costa Rica is one of the nations in the world.
How did you find out about Costa Rica and her sickeners?
We've got a lot of field service, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and I've got a lot of people.
I'm going to go to Costa Rica and Mexico, and to Mexico, this is from the surfing base, and that's how we're talking about it, from the people who are surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say you're a show with a lot of people.
What are you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we didn't go there, we don't have any idea that we can do it.
We're going to try to do a show with a series of performances; we're going to try to track the record from the album and introduce our fans to the repertoire.
You're not a repertoire.
How'd you do that?
I think that's because we've got nine records and we're able to do better than 120, and we're able to do better than 120, and we're able to do better than 120, and we're able to do better than 120, and we're going to do better than 120, and we're going to do it, we're going to do it, we're going to do it, we're going to do it, we're going to do it, we're going to do it, we're going to do it, we're going to do it tonight.
We have two or three units, we don't have to do it, it keeps us in a tone and hurts us, because that's what we're talking about, love we loved ourselves and what we could do.
It's a show that's good for us and us, and I think it's good for people.
You've been on tour for 20 years.
Look back at everything you've been doing?
Yes, I am.
I don't think any of us could imagine that we were going to be in a rock company and that we've been doing this for 20 years.
We rejoice in our fortunes and we rejoice in the things we are able to do.
We all love each other and love the campaign.
We're going to places in the country where we're going.
Everything's good for us.
What does that mean to you?
It was an honor to be honored by the great crowd.
We've been working with Soundgarden, Mudhoney, and Alice in Chains.
That's great, it grows from the office, and that's good.
The city is one of the cities, but five or ten of the people are in the same place in the city.
We're proud and honored to be in Seattle.
I'm still messing with one of them.
Last year we were at Alice in Chains and we were in Mudhoney, we were on their tour of Soundgarden, we were on board with them, we were on board with them, and we were honored to take the sound of Seattle, and we were honored.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Yeah, four of us are 21 years old, and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago, which in itself is worth more than anyone else.

We're all freemen, and we're all free will, and, you know, the right to go, the right to go, the right to go free.
We trust each other's music, and everything couldn't do anything.
Your glory was unforgivable to the word of your word; but you have done all that you have done.
How do you find the balance?
We've got a balance, we've got a balance.
We're going to talk about not being on tour, because it's easy to put crowds and men in the camp to take your people.
For now, that men are for the sake of the cause, it is for thee that thou shalt take the lead, and that which she is not to be renowned for the famous and rock-guilty, that which none of us in the midst of us shall speak of.
You've done your project, Manner Love Bone?
I think we're writing the title of the board, and it was in everything.

That was a bad guy, and we miss him.
The local standing of Las Robertas will be for a show show in Costa Rica.

Do you change the words at Yellow Ledbetter's concerts?
This is a visit to Ed, so I don't know.

Who's going to attack you like a bass player?
There's so much.
Who comes to mind, Gezer Butler, John Entwhistle, C.J. Ramon, John Do, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so much that I can talk all day about Bassists, and I love them.
How did Pearl Jam get involved in the campaign of garnage, saying that he's no longer in fashion?
I think we're all not immune to the word "grange."

At first you were very gloomy, and at first it was very positive.
How do you know what you're doing?
It's interesting, because I think there's a lot of people in the album who can do it, but there's a lot of people in the And or Just Breathe, even though they might sound a little positive.
Wherefore, I cried, I heard them, I heard them, I heard them, I heard them.
I think what you're doing, and you've had some kind of trauma, and you've killed a member of either, or a friend, you've been looking at your creation and your behavior, and you've got two, of course, it's for me.
So, I think you can do a lot of things and you can do a lot of dark stuff.

I've had a lot of people with no people.
It's been 25 years since Trijove International: 6,000 percent of the people under the Police have helped to protect the fourth quarter of the population.
I'm going to add a hundred hundred officers to the office for the office.

The occupation invaders 11 out of 13 units at 51 Balmes.
12 of the occupations left the army at noon without a warrant.
It's a nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare.
At noon, they left the army, and the illegal occupations and occupations, and the punishments, and the punishments, and the punishments.
It was done, it's locked on the door, it's locked on the door, it's repeated.
"As soon as possible, we'll have access control," said the manager.
The Squatters, they captured 11 of the 13 troops, the community, they put everything and a fraction of the water, they painted and scavenged various objects, they took a bank of alcoholic beverages.
There were three seats on the party floor, and they'd hung up to the party, and they'd talk to them.
The club, Balmes 51, was damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, for Europe Press, that since the Deno, her income has been 80 percent.
The owner of the club says that the invaders took her into unfair competition, because they sold three drinks for three, like a club for ten.
Besides, the discoster was on noise, although, as she said, the noise was not a club visitor, but the people of the Squat and, I mean, the subjects of the club, where they had the frequency and frequency of the movement, as the government said.
The owner of the club said that she had done things like that, that she had done things with the company, and now he's nine and nine, he's forgiven her for paying her fees.

In fact, he said, "It is necessary to put an end to violence and to maintain a culture, to create a culture in action."
Okay, so we're taking the evacuater to New Jersey.
At 15:30, the DEA on Montral, 35 percent from the police, the police, like the authorities in the action.
Four of them.
Park or mountain?
Architecture for the competition competition competition for the debate over the
The town of the 16-door competition competition on the role of Colcerola in Barcelona.
In the '80s, on the execution of the collapsed city of Barcelona City, the U.S.S.S.A., and the posting of the Colcerola ads.
The book describes the mountain as the park park of Barcelona table park.
Well, it was compared to the pictures of New York Park Park.
So, in 1987, the Park of Action of the SKB, which was a public consciousness park of many as Barcelona's highest point as the capital of Catalovo, one of the capital, not on the right-hand side, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The posture of Colcerola as the natural park of the country.
The prototype wasn't a park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar in the role of Yoga's nurse.
That's how it was, until, in Paris, the Council of the Non-Professional, 16 competitions for a bunch of other gates to Colcerole.
Under the gates, the park's fences, okay?
Either that or someone wants to put the gates on the field.
Colserola, park or mountain?
The competition, and their side, and their side, and their side on the city, for the assembly of Barcelona's city.
It's the same thing as repeating the subject, the first two members of the human clan are in the driver's seat.
And the fact that fact leads to one of the coincidences is that it's three of Barcelona's three capitals.
Miguel Rodan, Daniel Madolo and Mara Bayona:
For Roldan, the coast of the "necessary" state, the front side, the Ildefon Cerda, the mountain with green apples, was not.
"We have to assume that Barcelona Park is the beach.
Besides everything else, he's got a great job.
Colcerola Dezia," says the headline entitled "The Colcerole Gate" for "the word": we don't think of them as "as the entrance to the park, but as the zone, we're the zone, we're the zone.
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayon, with a city in the city, called the "and the "and the "and the" with "some of the "rights."
Risks, not the '80s, but the Swan Song.
Fear is the limit of boundaries, you can make it.
"Something's about something, it's about something," I mean.
"Anything about the general capital plan (GSP) can lead to trouble."
Closer to you, Modolo Modola, that the Calcerola Valley can be understood like a park, Barcelona, not as a pure topographer.
The Modolovo, which is already a work in charge of Calcerola, is not "not about getting past the ears," although he is responsible for the charge, the governor of his company, to take part in the project "from the beginning."
And the fact is, that the city's intimacy is a pass, but "he's in" is whether it's the subject of whether it's a team ("success," it's a team), or whether it's the Architecture.
The Bayon suggests that it's on the board, that it's on the side of the side, and it's folded, because in the rules of the Collserola competition, "There were 16 million contests,," he says, "on the Goth Sea, but there's no reading, a title, and a sense of the area as an expression."
It's a 16-to-six-to-six competition.
The project for one gate is about to run through the project and the project for one gate.
From the point of view, it's my duty that the stripes above Rhonda de Daltus are in the area of the city, which is designed for the smooth flow of city and green.

There's a neide in the wreckage of a ship, some kind of fire, or fire.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The land is from seven to 30 ounces.
It's shown in the pictures, and it's on the road.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's not that a ship's crew was scattered, that it was hit, that it was hit in the country.
MSS Office of the obese gene
A study of the obesity gene in both people and people; it's from IPN
Mexico's Office of Human Services (MSSI), which conducts a study of the obesity gene in both humans and humans, the protocol "Henthetic Obesity in Humanity and Humanity" and the protocol "Genetic Obesity in Humanity and Humanity" and the protocol "Genetic Obesity in Humanity in Humanity" and "Genetic Obesity in Humanity in Humanity in Humanity" and Human Rights.
The head of the Head of the Central Hospital of the 21st Century Hospital, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a team of therapists, nurses, dietologists, and leaders had been gathered together in a multi-professional group.
The National Institute of Health and Health (NIPH) and the Center for Human Rights and Rights (CINVEESTAV) of the National Police (NCI).
If you go to the MSSI Sports Center, you go to the Valley of France, you'll be tested with the authorities from 8:00 a.m. in the morning.
He said that the protocol would be to conduct a sports course in Quautemoke (in the western state of the state), and with 8 percent in the sports force in Nesaualcooyotle (state of the state of the state).
It's about how between 500 and 600 people are going to be in the Sports Department of Status (South Africa) and Morelos Sports Center (north France).
It's done what it is to understand and define genetics in the capacity of obesity and to establish a risk factor for the Mexicans and the Mexicans for the purpose of protecting the degeneration of the Mexicans.
The 14th day will be the first day of the week, and the three men and women in the six to 14 years of the year will be the first day of the week, with the interrogator's request forms.
They'll ask about the activity and the risk of risk, and the risk of leading to the rise of the action, such as the attack or the appearance of the assault.
He explained that in the 18th anthropometer, the weight, growth and circumference of the waist, the blood and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin and insulin, and the control (Gen, with obese obesity).
Crus Lopez said it's a charge against the police.
In fact, from 1999 to 2006, it's said that in six years, the growth rate is 77 percent obesity, 47 percent obesity, and that it's too much growth, says MSSI.
He said that the validity of the markers was based on the fact that it was against the other peoples on the basis of the vote.
He reported that in Mexico a 65 percent descendants of Mexicans, 30 percent descendants of Africans, and five percent descendants of Africans, and that it affected genes, genes, population and population.
It's about the genetics of obesity, which is basically about the genetics of obesity, and it's about to kill the handkerchiefs, and it's about fat.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Even, he said, "It's the subject of folding the folds on the chess and the forearms of metabolism and any prediabetes.
The doctor hands it over to the family, and they enforce all and all in the form of a law, and the doctor takes it into the form of a law, and they take it into the form of a law, and they take it into the form of a law, and they take it into the form of a law, and they take it into the form of a law, and they take it into the form of a law, and they take it into the form of a law, and they take it into account.
Crus Lopez University, which is three times three, provoking weight, obesity and obesity: sedentary image, or lack of activity, half the day of the house in front of the seat, and transportation on the sides of the house, to pass.
It's for the sake of calories, so there's and there's a sugar and carbohydrate supply (tomatoes, beans, hamburgers, hamburgers, etc.) of fats and proteins, and a predisposition that's in it.
Asphalt UNAM
Raphael Errera, professor of the UNAM Department, polymer-medicinal bitumen, I'm taking care of the police, I'm taking care of the police, and I'm taking care of the police.
To the authorities, by road traffic, it would have been possible to repair up to 200 percent of the yards of the season in the Paris Valley, says Raphael Errera Nahera, a spokesman for the UNAM Department, and that both the department and the asphalt board are governed by the pits of the nucleus, or the pits are reduced to zero.
In his campaign, Technologist for pits, read within the framework of a range of chemistry, he carries for himself a polymer-maritime bitumen for those who have the characteristics of battery, but with both at and at temperatures.
Ererer Nahera said that the type of meth battery that hits the ground, that the weather is hot, like the cities on the coast, the roads and, on the other hand, the pits.
It's a bit like a bitumen, it's part of a molecule of carbon monoxide molecules, some are a molecular union, it's called asfaltens, and the other is a molecular union of Maltens, and it's his characteristic viscosity.
The viscoups of the bitumen bitumen is the fact that at the topmeratures at 180, he behaves like 120 of his whiskers are tall, and at 50 degrees Celsius he is firm, in the way the temperature is controlled by the bitumen beat, he said.
It's the fact that the street asphalt is not asphalt, but in the middle of the day, on the side of the police, and on the side of the police, he said to the party in the company of the government.
The scientist's chemist, who's basically in the six units, and the three units include bitumen.
It's the top of the bitumen, which comes from little bits, puts it in bitumen and then presses.
He said, hit a bit.
With the force and the example of the force, it's the force of the force that's pretty good for the force.
If it were an asphalt, they'd fight a lot, said the chemist.
On the asphalt, he's taking, he's taking, he's taking, he's taking, he's taking, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he' he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he' he's got, he' he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he' he' he's got, he' he' he' he' he' he' he' he' he' he' he' he' he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he' he' he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he's got, he' he's got, he's got, he' he's got, he' he' he' he' he' he' he' he's got, he' he' he's got, he' he's got, he's got, he' he's got, he's got, he' he'
Because of this, you're going to have contact with the wheels of the vehicle, he's going to be in contact with the vehicles, he's going to be in contact with the asphalt and exercise.
I'm going to take care of it, and I'm going to take care of it, and I'm going to take care of it, and I'm going to take care of it, and I'm going to take care of it, and I'm going to take care of it, and I'm going to take care of it, and I'm going to take care of it, and I'm going to take care of it, and I'm going to make it.
The weather, the violence and the declines, the severity of the factors, the water, he said, because she's taking the asphalt.
The soil is swept, the water is infiltrated, and it's hard for it, it's a softening of the body, and, of course, the pits.
He said, "If you're wearing a weed and then it's a ride to the bitumen, but it's not running, it's under the charge of the government.
A member of the police force, that transport is just one factor in the operation of the police, and a member of the police is responsible for carrying out the load and carrying out the work, and often the pits.
Raphael Errera said that the bitumen was all necessary and necessary, by the way, bitumen muscularity, other acts are already on board, and they make holes with ease and without temperature.
You didn't present a candidate for Valle, who would be Columbus Columbus?
I'll explain the reasons why I'm going to take Cerna Melina Ramirez to the crown of the wife.
Valley's wife's title of title is 14 times.
This is the time Valle del Cowca took the crown of Mississippi.
On one occasion, Melina Ramirez Cernaza was the subject of a runway with a crown and a crown and a police force on her behalf.
In the evening of Carthen, the Miss Atlantic took the crown and the scepter, the 14th title of the title, and Melina joined the legion of the Valle del Cauca, with the crown, but with the titles Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Belina Ayal (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Marie Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Elila Blanquet (88), Monika Evers (89), Maria Sunsuela Pinedo
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
Because as a result of the favoritism, she's got everything, who's a Miss Columbia, for a reason, she was King Paul's wife and a beautiful figure in Vogue, titles, titles, titles of the Queen, chieftain, Tatian Vargas, or Natalie Navarro, who was the crown of Missy's.
The factor that played the role of the jury in the first princess was that she didn't take the title of First Princess, that she didn't take the title "The book of the book characterizes you and you?, according to Martin Murilla Gomez of the literary charity, let's take a look at it.
She said,
"I read a lot, I believe in Germany, I think it's a form of culture, and I think it's a book characterized by "The Little Prince" -- it's a really tough book.
It's a masterpiece that I'm reading at the moment, and I'm reading the book Irina Nemirs, the writer of Latin, the beautiful book under the title "The Fire of Blood."
It's because it didn't specifically say how the quote of books describes it.
But Melina said that she was calm and satisfied with the result: "All the wise are wise, that they are wise."
And all of you, please read the book, "The Little Prince" is the book.
It sounds like a hypothesis -- Valle with the exception of favoritism.
The reporter of Bogotá, who, in his preference, preferred to be a ovation, and she was a candidate, a candidate of all the wives (Clinical competition with Ostera, a viewer for a suit, and Queen-Mother), "the roar of other candidates, the inducement of the queen's protection, and how she did not shine at the march."
And it was her first act in a bathing suit on Hilton Beach and her performances on the evening crown.
She's got her hands full, she's got her hands full, she's not got her hands full, she's not got her hands full, she's got her hands full, she's got her hands full, she's got the Magda Atlantic and she's got the Magda Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, the "House at Home" secretary on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was known as the "means that the candidate you're taking more in the competition, not the queen."
That's right, Valley's wife in charge of the press, and that was wrong.
The hypothesis is that Vallet's assassin failed the jury's successor in charge of bringing in the law, and I'm in charge of the Contestation of Beauty.
That's what two days before she was a member of Miss Dota's High Court, said that she was a member of the civil court, who was a member of the civil court.
She said, "One thing for Mississippi, we're not going to look at the outside, but we're also focusing on the consciousness, before they get into the competition, they're already getting into the competition," she said.
It's very controversial, since the jury of particular hers, as a candidate with "esta beauty," and in her whole healthy body, the head and I'm taking care of her.
The counsel of King George Hernan Orosco, that Mellin didn't have the body, which was both body and body, "but there was a fibrosis on his belly, which I didn't have, took her glasses for me on the first day."
Cross-theme, Mrs. Guido Oios of Cromos, of Cromos University, that Valle de Cauca is involved in the fact that she was involved in her own intervention.
"Operation is good, but Valley didn't do as much as they did.
Her body was not hers, and she was punished for it.
It's a prize, it's once and for the first time in the hand of the competition, the predictions came true, that it was a giver, that it was Raimundo de Melinda's fault that she remained crowned.
So whether or not, the fact is that Mellie had a year's life, not a queen's wife, but a queen's wife, but a wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife, a wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife, a wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife' wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's wife's
But she's in a fight like one of the queens, one of the queens, one of the queens at the kartachen competition, with the crown rulings.
That's what Alfonso Cano's body identified.
CSI from Calais to the police, like the death of Alfonso Cano.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
4 CTI Calais in the company of the FARC and Alfonso Cano in comparing his prints.
There are seven officers at CTI, and there's a "device" by Jázzarzena, from Tehad, for 21 years in the army.
In the city of Choco, he was often asked about five inches through the jungle, the police station, the police station, and he needed to do the same.
In 2000, he went to Valle and he became a member of the human race, and he was trained to train his men, that is, his hands and his feet.
He was told to take three days.
It wasn't here that was coming.
When he arrived, he was on a raid from Cauca in Palmyra.
He knew that he needed two corpses, and one of them, like the other, had the oldest party in the world, so that he was asked to take ten pictures of the prints of Guillermo León Saens.
However, when he brought his body with his armor on his body, he did not recognize it in the face of it; he was greatly distressed by the fact that he was in the company of the public authorities.
He was without beard, dressed like a farmer, without glasses, and thinner.
But you don't lie.
And the ink, the blade, and the scapegoat, the phonsar compared the body's body to the figures on the pictures.
It was Alfonso Cano.
At the same time, the Tehad police asked Juan Juan Carlos Pinson that it was the CHRC.
The fingerprints of the body
To take into the Cijin Dactyloscopy of Calicia from Calicia, which is from President Juan Xin Santos Caesar to the Press Council for Action Against Cano, especially significant.

In addition to the bodies, the Dactyloscopies in the police, such as theft and murder, and the action.
In the case of a forgery or not.
We take them and put them in action.
He said he stole a piece of the house, because the thief in the house resisted with his hands, his safe, his possessions, and his property.
"With walls, because you're not comfortable with the surfaces of the prints, but in you we're able to get the palm of the hand and to get the hands of the people who are stealing," he is.
Prints from the police, or shares in the actions, with the murders.
Recently he was a man with a handkerchief under his liquor.
There's been evidence that there might have been a suspect in the police and, in the case of the case, the statements on the rack match.
It's not that he was a Witness, it's that he was in a suit.
There's a Dactilescope from CTlPl, which is on the plaza, which is a chemical, or a chemical reagent.
It turns out, the blade or the blade, to take them off.
I've got prints from Asif, I've got a job, or I've got a job.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of uninformed documents on Columbia," said CTI.
He explained that not everything is as shown on the CSI television.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not all that you touch, but upon itself.
However, if it is, it will be done.
New York City's authorities are in charge.
Hundreds of protesters protested before the Succothi.
The protest protester reported a riot and headed for the parking lot park.
New York City's "Take Wall Street" campaign against the New York City authorities, the New York City government, the New York State, the Manhattan government, the evacuater's office on the run for one park of Apple.
Hundreds of protest protesters dug into the Zukotti forces, where they ordered the orders, the "resenting men" to smash the forces into the forces, while part of the army took a run, captured the park on the city's border, and they took the city.
"Ours is that, since the court doesn't let us break it down on the ground, we're going to take charge of the Zukotta movement and through the sedentary strikes and strikes," said Mark Bray.
That the order was given to New York City Secretary Michael Bloomberg, to the court, to the Billings Board, to the President of the United States, to the President of the United States, to the President of the United Nations, to the President of the United Nations, to the President of the United Nations, to the President of the United Nations, to the President of the United Nations.
In fact, the "seven humans" began to take over the new park, which was located on Channel Street and Offenway Roads, moving from the Dutch Tunnel to the New York and New York Bay, and taking hold of the coming of the Tropas Church.
At least for a time, they could have done it, but then the police came and started to protest, although Bray couldn't find the exact number, but he told Efe that he saw them, and he also had handcuffed them.
They believe that hundreds of hundreds of men stood with tents in the camp, where the police were held, that they were all members of the staff, that they were in negotiations with the police.
It's the Zucotti, it's the Zucotti, it's the army, it's the police force, it's the police force, it's the police force, it's the police force, it's the protest in the morning.
The protesters, the protesters, they send them in, they bring them in, they bring them in the same way, and they give them the officers, they force them, which leads them to "some small figures," said Bray, the attorneys, that they beat the protesters.
The authorities take the evacuate of Wall Street and force "laws, powers of capture, or protesters to get access to the park with shops and stores.
Mayor Bloomberg told the reporters that because of the city's presence, the city had suspended the city's headquarters and the demonstration of the police, but he did not allow the police to make stores and sleeping bags.
A member of the Board of Defense protested against Zukotti, invading the army, invading the army, invading 200 persons, and invading them, because the protest was "infringing the law."
Bloemberg said that he had ordered the cleanup, which made it "a place where people came, not protest, but law and, in it, they bring to other people," because "non-prisoners" and "non-prisoners" were afraid of "for themselves."
The evacuation of the first morning was an ingenuity and the fact that the death of the soul of Bloomberg was more important in the administration of the civil service, the President of the Republic, the President of the Republic for "abstinence to the word."
The campaign for "Take Wall Street" was launched on Thursday with the "Grandiose Company" and the "Grandiose Company" on Thursday, on Thursday, with the citizens and the citizens, two protest protesters, 17 protesters.

Twitter Twitter changes its platform and Facebook
On the Internet, Twitter's website has included in its staff, in its staff, in its staff, in its staff, in its staff, in the ranks of those who are behind it, that it's going to take them to Facebook.
The "activity" tab and the "name" tab are easy and easy to use for other "twitterers," the Internet user, the "twitters" tab, and the "twitters" tab you're sending, and the ones who're sending them.
It's about getting to know, it's about getting to know, it's about having to sign on to the bank accounts, it's about having to know who they are, and so on.
The Twitter formula was a protest against the "low percentage in" in front of the "invasion invade" in front of the "invasion invade" office, and the APF stated that the Twitter press secreted by Dalvin Penner.

In the Constitution of the Golden Rule,
Under the leadership of the social-democracy and the democratic-democracy movement, in power in France, in favor of the "Golden Rule" in the Constitution of the State, the budget level, and thus the lowering of credit rating ratings by credit rating agencies (threefold A).
Social-democracy chancellor Werner Faimann said that he was at the end of the campaign, and that Austria had 74.6 percent, which was more than the threshold of 60%, the Maastrich Treaty, but it was the duty of such countries as Islam, freedom or action.
We're going to have to pay three cents more than a year more, to argue the argument of the Francis-Canceller and the Council of Affairs from the Czech Democrats Michael Spindellegger.
Thus, the 26th class members of the State in the State; the 12th year; and the constitution of the State or the law of gravity.
The Austrian law, the German model, was the one who said "rule."
By 1717, the structural level of GDP per year is estimated to be 0.75% of the gross product (UV), and since 117, the structural level of the federal government in the year is not equal to 0.35% of GDP, but, like the VCR, it is equal to that.
The goal is to achieve a drop of 60% under the Maastrich Treaty by 2020, 200221.

I've been involved in the intervention of the police.
It's Esichiko Noda's policy that the authorities will conduct the intervention of the officers on the board, and they'll take charge of it, and they'll take it.
We're going to intervene like this once, and we're going to consider the exact volatility of the course and course, Mr. Noda Senate.
We're going to have to go before we do, and we're going to have to take the power to intervene 31 people.
You sold the yen on your day for dollars in the United States, you sold the Iena for the U.S. dollar in the United States, you sold the Iena for the U.S. dollar in the United States, you sold the record since 1945.
But ever since, the yen has grown, the shopping company has been known as a safe haven in the sadness of the peace and peace movement in the United States.
The dollar went down over 77 yen, and the dollar fell down at 105 yen, close to the scene, the intervention agency.
It cost about 120 yen at the start of the 21st century, and 160 yen at 160 yen.
The growth rate pays a high price to the government's office, and pays the income of the employees to the bank in exchange for the conversion of the currency.
"Resister, self-involved" and "self-involved" by 1111, they defeated Tohoku (north-century), Mr. Noda, who feared that there was growth and that there was a growing fetus in charge of the fetus.
It's growing in the size of the state. It's growing in the size of the state.

We've got 7% of the people on board, we've got a double figure in the population by the year 2050, and part of the population will not be left out.
It's the same thing as recapitalizing the increase in the number of people, the number of people under the government, not in charge of the total amount of gas, the number of people with an imbalance in the country, the number of people with an imbalance in the country, and the number of people with an imbalance in the country.

We pay 40% more than the French government pays.
Because, in a globalized measure of competition, and in a competitive measure, and in a measure of equity in the government, the French government has taken the cheapest price in the country.
It's a significant measure of growth, and it's an illusory to make an illusory statement about the actions and actions of the authorities and the actions of the authorities.
The price, the price of the French paying, is because they're not against the idea of a form of a price in the company.

There was a party to Nicolas Sarkozy's care: the police, the police, the police, the figures of the figures, and the self-declaration of the state as "the rights of the people."
It was followed by the students, and the students were taken to the police, the officers of the police, and the officers of the police of affairs (Liberation, of May 23), who said that they were "not talented, stoned, stoned, and stoned."
But it's being guided from the point of view.
The right and the right are in a lot of trouble.

Presidents Goodluck Jonathan Alen Juppe's report on Boko Haram's execution and the invasion of the police.
Peace like his guian as president.
With Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, and Rick Perry, we're in competition in both incompetence and incompetence.
Is it possible for the weakened U.S. America to pursue peace with the U.S. and the U.N. to pursue peace with the U.S. and the U.N. to take action?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've already seen Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and the police multiply the thunderstorms, but the details of the charges are very detailed, and they're very strong.
Lozunges, women, women, women, women, and children often talk to each other.
Mitt Romney, in his campaign against the Old World, threatened to bring Chinese complaints to the stock market and bring them into "manipu currency currency is the theme for America, and it's the theme for America, and it's the capitals in Asia.
He said.
John Chancesman, Ambassador Obama's ambassador in the army, and the candidate, who took the lead in the military, failed to fight the opposition, and he indulges the Eios.
He's working hard, but he's working with Beijing.
But he's in charge of the ratings, he's not in charge.
Reagan Style
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"They'll pick me, I'll stop him," he announced.
They're going to have a bomb.
He accused Obama of being guilty of being guilty of being a partner partner.
Recipient Herman Kane, in the ratings of the score, the guy who's done no business.
He's recently taken the lead, because Beijing's power is obviously not that China's been taking it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, the President of the United States, says that he's ready to take the U.S. action against drugs.
They're going to run to the police force in 2009 by Obama, recommended by Kane, Perry, and candidate Michel Bachman.
All of this is far from being a candidate for 2008 by John McCain, a weighted candidate.
Resisters of the President's office, that Reagan's got a very simple policy and that he's out of the cold.
They're saying that Obama himself was a lover and that he had a tone in his relationship with him.
They're just about to take his naive action with him, the "kiddies" team from the police, his tricks in Canada, bringing him a weak man.
But it's not that easy.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's not an intervention, it's trapped in the sand.
And, you know, that America's going to re-enter the state of justice, Obama's right.
North Stream, open gate to enter the gas into the country.
The North Stream Gas Pipe, which is blowing up the port and Russia along the sea floor, is now under way.
He's driving gas on 30 people.
Gazprom, gas, pump.
There are 500 guests, a chapter of the Presidents and the Presidents of the Courts on the Baltic Coasts, an orchestra and a snack board, the North Stream, a new gas pipe, Russia and Germany underwater.
The chancellor of Angel Mercury, President Dmitry Medvedev, President François Fion and his Dutch viceroy, Martin Rütet detachment, turned the ventilator back, controlled gas control in the European Union.
The new gas line is 27.5.5.5 cube cubic meters of gas a year in the country's first pipe, 1,224 km, in Leningrad oblast, in Mecklenburg-Pomer State.
The pipe is ready at the end of 2012, and it's going to be 55.5 cubic meters [55.5 m] of gas for all the needs of the government.
And the construction of the pipe wire on the same site is already under way.
For Gazprom, it's a charge.
It's a project of a bitter and violent campaign.
The North Stream allows gas to be transported to Germany, escaping the passage through the Bay (Polshu or Ukraine).
Two men destroy the power of the government: the state will take control of Russia, secure access to the government.
At the very moment Warsaw did not hold back before comparing the North Stream with the Germano-ency Covenant, which insinuates the union of the State, and took the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that you're the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who
This is a project underway, it's under supply control.
But it's because the project is a lie to both the police and the police.
It's done more than five years before the direct bond and the long west of the country, they're bringing the gas and gas to the country, and they're already on it.
"The gas pipe is part of the gas pipe, it's part of the country, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of us," by François Fion, running the gas pipe, it's a demonstration, it's part of the gas force, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of us, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the state, it's part of the state, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of us, it's part of the government, it's part of the state, it's part of the state, it's part of the state, it's part of the state, it's part of the state, it's part of the state, it's part of the state, it's part of the state, it's part of the state, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the state, it's part of the government, it's all, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government, it's part of the government's all of the government, it's all, it's part of the government, it's part of the government's part of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the government, it's us, and it's all, and it's part of the state, and it's all, and it's all, and it's us, and it's all, it's part of the state, it's part of the state, and it's part of the state of the state of the state of the state of the government, it's part of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the
It's all on the heads of Gazprom who were in the Ljubmin Bay, the gas gate.
That's also a feat.
Under the pipe, the steel is made of steel, in concrete, from the anchors of the ships.
It's lying on the sea bottom, it's 200 meters.
You should've taken it, you should've had a minefield, you should've had it.
"The hundreds were either invaded or invaded," said Jens Muller, the press organization of the North Stream.
It's a lot of stuff, it's a lot of wildlife and flora.
The pipe is the fermented snake of the world, weighed at the weight of 124 Eiffe Towers, with no airstrips, no fans, no fans.
The control platform was in the country, but it was a project on it, because it wasn't thrilled that the company was going to settle on its shores.
"We're going to cut the gas flow off in less than a moment," by Jens Muller.
So the gas is going to go into the gas pipe, get in the air.
But it's an unlikely designer, a seam design, a leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the gas pipe will be an underwater robot, and the control of the gas pipe will be a pushover robot, and the control of the gas pipe will be a pullover robot, for the police, and the circuitling of the gas pipe.
Cigarette in a 1-foot pipe pipe and pushed forward with a flow of gas.
3 meters 3 meters per second. It's a good idea about the deformity of the office.
The gas pipe was designed for 50 years without a slight penalty.
The gas Circus is in charge of his arrest.
It's 200 bars at the start and 100 bars at the run.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The leader of Gaza Gazprom, 51% of the company.
The Germans are E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French newspaper Group GDF Suez (9 per cent).
Five units, called the North Stream, had to run and run the gas pipe.
His headquarters is in Tsuga in Paris, and he's in charge.
Send Gazprom to hire him for years with all the gas.
"Gazprom will pay for the charge, and of course, gas will actually be transported," by Jens Muller.
The gas pipe was up to 30 percent of the supplies and 70 percent of the bank loans.
Two pipes.
The GDF Suez is 240 percent.
But the minority leaders who will pay for them, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The road from the Sea of the Holy Sea in Lubmin to the coastal shore, planting soaps.
The vents are four and a half feet [4.5 m] high.
The sensors measure the temperature, temperature, and characteristics of the gas before pumping it into the German gas pipe.
One third of a cubic meters of gas is time.
It's going to be 3 times a time, and in 2012 it's going to be 6.

Moleskine, Italy's five-five years ago, will bring the taste back to it.
He's got the aroma of adventure, hours, writing at the time.
Moleskine's notepad is easy to navigate through the right side of the cover, in the rubber, in the slightly white, in the white, in the middle of the front.
However, the notebook Moleskine, which we considered to be the one in 1997, was written.
It's the Modo Modo Modo Company in Milan, and it's going to run the designer of the notepad.
Maria Sebregondi, a senior consultant of the firm, took action to launch a new product.
The notebook of the police, the molescine, the lacquer boy boy-kiddling, the women's office, the women's office, the women's office, the women's office, the women's offices.
It's amazing that the type of notepads value writing and writing.
"Moleskine in a tasteful old-fashioned and infamous style, which was the cult of a cult for the vending artists before the 20th century," said Maria Sebregonde, who has since become a brand brand in Modo Modo.
He's gone.
Between 2006 and 2010, it was 25%, 12.7 million.
We're far away from the years, and we've had as many as 3,000 notepads.
Molyskine crossed the branch and moved in 70 countries, from the U.S. to the U.S.
I'll set up a typical case, because the notebook is from Louis, the student, and the state office.
Buying Molyskine's cosmopolitan policy, the police and the government.
Little Italy Company, 12 officers, 100 and two units, one in Milan, one in New York.
She runs her notebooks at Fnac's bookshops, shops in the headquarters centers, and the evidence.
"Resisting the spirit of the spirit and the authority of the letter, on the side of the letter," by Maria Sebregonda.
It's the cultural character of Moleskine; it's recently the brand of the "Cool Road" exhibition, where the artists and the artists have their own blockbook.
He's run the cover of a leopard with a drawing of the Locarno Master's Fair.
In response to the efforts and efforts of the Aura, Moleskine has made his own presentation, which includes bags, pens, bags for the Aura.
Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, by Syntegra Capital, and signed by Moleskine.
Is the fate of the family so high?
19% work.
The 15th and the 15th were on the move.
Not on the face, starting in 2005, the percentage of the percentage of the percentage of the percentage of the percentage of the population in 2005 was only two-half, and 19% versus 9% for the total.
Are you upset?
"No, I'm Ric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, I'm sorry."
"In 15 years, I've been in prison."
"In that fraction, it wasn't two, it was three times more."
"However, there's a lot of money."
I have to tell you that there's a lot left for the Pitai in there.
There are more: 37% over 50 years of age (17%).
They've got 80 percent not a bachelor's degree, but 2.3 percent of the students at 10,000.
That's 85% for women versus 38% for women.
In short, all of this, all of this, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, according to President Grapen, Director General Tremplin, President of the Republic, in 1992, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of it, all of this, all of it, all of this, all of this, all of it, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of it, all of it, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of it, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of which, all of which, all of this, all of which, all of this, all of which, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, all of this, it, all of this, it, all of this, it, all of this, all of which, and all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of the work and all of the work and all of the work and all of the work and all of this, all of the work and all of the work and all of the work and all of the work and all of the work and all of this, all of the work and all of this, all of this, all of the work and all of the work and all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of the work and all of this, and all of this, all, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of this, all of the
That's what I'm talking about.
No one speaks of mentality, but they do.
IMS-Entreprendre at Cita's order, showed that a survey by the manager of the board of directors of the board of directors of the board of directors of the department of police and "representing themselves to a number of people in wheelchairs or cars, or to a non-principle."
The result is that 20 people are far from 6% of the population, in 1987.
By 2008, we're looking at 2.6 percent.
"Today we're at 3%," says Nick Blanc, director general of Agefiphh, the prosecutor for the police, who is not under the law.
Proof: the number of the tax collectors, as well as the paid payees, ran from 2007-2009, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 percent).
"The 2005 Act, the police force, the strong force on the force, the Blanc."
"But it's an increase in productivity, in the United States, in the United States."
The rate is 59% with 20 to 49 percent with 20 to 82% with 100 to 199.
Azar: "I'm sorry."
Before you fight the Blues in the evening of Friday (20.45) Eden Azar and Georges Leachens didn't kill, they took a friendly match.
We're not going to get to the point that there was a conspiracy with them, but the painting is symbolic.
Sitting next to Stade de France, Georges Leachens and Eden Azar were reconciled.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, with the fact that he's a Belgian."
"I want to go further, I'm sure I'm going to believe that I'm going to kill Lille.
It's one thing, it's one thing, it's him.
"I've been in Lille for a year, but I'm not in Lille."
"I've got my points."
Remained in stock, in a match match with the team, in a game against the fight in the night, Azar in St. Deny, and he said "greeting."
I don't like it, but I'm also talking about "pleasing."
It took the Blues since they were seven years old and took care of 1998 and 2000 years.
"I took them, he did.
That's, of course, the character of the match.
He said, "These are the things which are on the throne of Ceté (Debushes), Johann (Cabe), and Adil (Ramim)," he said.
"It's just our roads that have crossed."
"To have a fight against them is to do it."
Leachens's good-natured talk about pride.
"Perfect" at the Christmas match.
"Perfect" in "suggest" that "newly became a team of people" just a year later, in the Nist.
"Loran Blan was like a thunderstorm, admiring him.
Now, if he misses the job, a tech athlete will fly with the blues... to Brazil in 2014.
"Ours are the Belgians," he did.
"Something built, you're hungry, you're hungry."
You're going to fight the match.
I'm sure I've got a sense of myself.
▪ Paulo Bentu presented his match against Bay (22:00 p.m.) in the United States with the police.
You've got both men on your way to him, you've lost your way to him.
By 90 minutes we'll be a team and what we'll do is we'll be a team.
Paulo Bentu is already in and out.
He hasn't had a man who's been driving since 2010 to take charge of it.
It's 90 minutes away.
But you have a match, you have to go, and you have to go, and you have to go.
It's clear that it's not true.
She didn't succeed in that fight, she would have killed her.
"It's a good result, but it's risky."
But in himself, at the office of the de la Lus in fege, the Portuguese, which will pass, at the seat of the army, the officers are thrilled, even though the match will be a match,' said the Romanist, but Bento.
We've got a 42-third port coach.
"We've got 50 percent interest in 2012," said Carlusz Keiros.
There's no one in a match against the Portuguese.
No one could have done a barefoot thing.
"It's a good result, but it doesn't take the risk, Ben Bent.
"Let's fight against it, there's a lot of violence and there's a lot of violence," he said.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese have had the maximum hope of being barefoot since the beginning, "Don't let them think about it."
I'd love to have her once and for once.
