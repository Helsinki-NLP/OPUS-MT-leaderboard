If there's no choice, I'll do it anyway.
Thank you in advance.
Back in Herson, the Russians hadn't been able to break up.
As told by the Westerners, the chersonians had been able to hold a rally before the military and technical equipment arrived at the site.
"We've had time to hold a rally, and now the PF technology has arrived," said one of the participants in the event.
In the past, the townspeople had traditionally gathered for protest at the Square of Liberty, near the ODA building and the charms.
This area, like the building, is now controlled by armed Russian troops, using weapons against protesters and stealing people.
On April 3, armed Russian occupations reportedly used weapons against peaceful protesters in Cahovca.
According to Ucrynform, in Donetsk, citizens regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggression.
Russian military forces use force and weapons against humans, are injured and detained.
Russian invaders also kidnap the inhabitants of the area.

Hi, I'm sick, so it's better to take you to the next weekend, I'm sorry.
I know how to cook, but I like to bake.
In Ukraine the traditional is the borsch, the cooks, the others.
I don't have favorite dishes, I like to try different dishes from country to country.
What do you like about cooking?
I want to be busy.
There's a train, there's no place.
Sorry, we're a little late.

Green: Mariupol is the heart of war, stop fighting, we're going to have weak positions
President Volodymir Greenski believes that fighting for the east of Ukraine, and especially for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the VSU is defeated there, the Russians can give up negotiations and recapitalize the deOccupied territories.
The direct language is, "Mariopole is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It fights, we fight, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have more weaker positions.
They're people who've pulled a lot of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the OSS, and if they are stronger, the table of negotiations will be closer to us and we will have the advantage of dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we may not wait to meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we're currently deoccupied with.
They can do the same.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting to the Russian side.
Sadly, we do.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory...
Detail: Greenski also said that going to negotiations after the torture of the Ukrainians is difficult, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
The direct language is, "People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think any peace will satisfy them on any condition.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it must end in millions of casualties.
And even where there's a million casualties, it all comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight -- but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing left, there's no people."
Good afternoon, do you have any more free seats for the Czech adult class from 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday?

Dominika, who buys the material?
This procedure is permanent, should it be ordered as soon as it is completed?
Because of the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality state.
It's the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the status study.
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows for analysis of post-modern contexts, such as where metaphor plays a role in acsiological criteria.

Good, 'cause I've already started drinking that I've got something wrong and I've got it wrong.

The main intelligence agency of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military officers who have been involved in military crimes in the Bucha region of Kiev.
According to Ucrynform, this is reported in Facebook by the Ministry of Defense’s General Intelligence Agency.
"Every Ukrainian must know their names!
The MoMA of Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 individual motorcycle crews directly involved in military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Butchá,” states the report.
In the MOU Group, it is noted that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and held accountable.
You can view the list by link.
According to Ucrynform, Irpin, Bucha, Hospital, and the whole region of Kiev were freed from Russian invaders.
In liberated cities and villages, massacres by Russian military civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, the city’s head, Anatoly Fedorook, reported that 280 people had been buried in brotherly graves.
On April 3, the attorney - general of Irina Venedictva stated that 410 bodies of killed civilians had been removed from the Russian invaders of the region of Kiev.
On February 24, Russia’s president, Lord Putin, announced the beginning of a full - scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian invader forces are firing and destroying key infrastructure objects, carrying out massive shellings of residential areas in Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, firing jet systems, ballistic missiles, air bombardments.
Good afternoon, I'm sorry, but I can't work for you because I'm going to go to Canada soon enough.
Right behind the dash, there are formal names, and then there's the snail expression, in parentheses, the abbreviations that are used on the clock schedule.
I don't want to bother you, relax.
I've been watching the weather forecast.
I don't need brandy.
Just nice clothes at normal prices and size.
We were at the store at the train station.
The trades they offer, can't do without the knowledge of language?
It's important, if there's such a tradition, I need to know for me to prepare)
I thought in a week, but we're going to have a bad time, sirens.
Tomorrow might be a bad connection on the way.
I thank everyone for their experience, even if it is painful.
I think I've had experience in every situation so that I don't make mistakes in the future.
The guidelines are made in the form of numbered written additions, which are part of this legislation.
I'm sure there's no problem with that.
In Ukraine, many people celebrate this week in the same way.
It depends on religion.
Is there a Greek Catholic or a Catholic?
At first, you can try it for free.
Maybe you could write us an algorithm to pay for it, so we'll pay for it.
We have that paper that kids get at the end of the school year, it's a table, and they get a witness at birth and married.
Yeah, he's on it like an experienced driver, but I don't know if it's better, but I'm worried about the walls of the apartment.
It's written to fill in the life story, in Czech...
I'll try to make it, because I'm still in the town hall, signing the papers.
My wife is not angry that you're on the phone
In my daily prayers I thank God and God for you.
May they cover you with their cover of love and warmth tonight.
My heart belongs to you.
Do you mind if I come right after the war?
place, day and time will be clarified according to interests and opportunities
We promised that if you went to school, we would surprise you.
Bullob's great, I have money for two months on the ground, the area doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
Photographs of dead and shot people have confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other, how could that happen in the 21st century?
And I'm not surprised at all, it's exactly what I was waiting for.
I took the children and the elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girl coworkers with the kids, and then he went back to the capital to work.
Ever since 2014, I've been helping the ZMA in a series of ways, and I've never doubted that in the case of the occupation, the front of Kiev would spare my family.
Because I was, and I'm absolutely sure, that the essence of the decaying Communo-CDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist; it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in Gitomir's prison.
A few years ago, in the Jewish U.S.S.A., a copy of the ancestors ’ shooting case was removed: the whole case was over a hundred pages, and the sentence of execution was very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was illiterate, denied the accusation.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was a free man, a poor one-door high, never went to the fortress.
The fact that they lived on the fertorians and had several cows was enough to condemn the parrot and the feeder of young children to death.
My parents did not even know where to bury them.
Grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed except two who agreed to give false testimony.
There's the name of the scissor Shary.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I won't be surprised if his own relative was a KGB informer.
The apple from the apple is not far from falling...
The shooter who had the peasants executed was the ethnic Russians.
As he analyzed the case, he was interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia like "The Deadly Wall," which are good reminders of what happened in those years.
So in today's Russia, the descendants of the NVSD found ways to punish and kill almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 to 80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalin’s oppression and publicly wrote the names of the killers were discredited and then destroyed.
It's like they found children's pornographic files on the computer, and they put them in jail for it, and they died soon.
The KGB is still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the past century.
So why are you suddenly amazed at their actions now?
There are the most repugnant traits of human nature.
On top of a thousand-year Ordinary tradition, there was slavery and imperial chavinism in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then they did an animal genetic experiment, cutting out intelligence during a few waves of red terror.
Look at the 1992 Half French film Checist, and that's what happened.
Zo, you saw my picture in my bathing suit.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from the cough?
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I also wanted to ask you if you know where the kids went, because Galia couldn't know them.
Honey, Igor asks if you can drive tomorrow.
It's very embarrassing for us to bother you so much.
You're very helpful, thank you!

I don't know how to go to Europe, but in our country, people enter marriage for different reasons, mostly useful, mercantile goals.
And I have a problem with that, if I don't love someone, it won't work.
Yes, we took our aunt home and drove her away immediately.
She was very grateful, and she cried.
I told her about you and how you helped the Ukrainians.
The tears were in her eyes.
I said if it might be possible, there might be some old blanket and pillow.
But it doesn't have to be, only if it does.
I certainly felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had a lot of questions about God, why my life has been affected by situations that have caused me to become distrustful.
Do the little grocery stores work?
It's just that I decided to go and you made the meetings.
That's right, but we don't even know where we are, and we don't know where we are. We've been looking for an hour today and we've been on foot.
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you wrote me.
Does your father just speak Russian or any other family?
You can have kids come to Valie and play the cholesterol.
All right, let's take the risk:)
I'm glad I met you too.
The apartment was talking to Volodymir, or I was asked to wait until they found or looked for me, and the ladies who lived with us said that we had to go to the museum subway station there was an institution that helped us find accommodations.
For the little one, I'm going to cross the barrier.
Some of their questions I didn't know the answer
So it was good for Thursday if you could.
I can't call the doctor because I haven't done a food license test yet.
But I can't call him because I ran out of money.
I can't fill in the phone because I don't understand the Czech online banking and the Ukrainian bank card doesn't keep up.
In addition to the waterphone, I can't change the fare so I have normal calls and the Internet doesn't fill out the number.
I'm going crazy.
The headline doesn't sound right, what do you mean?
I'm ashamed to be without a job.
I just wrote that at school,
I'm sorry to bother you, but I was very worried.
But it's closer to leaving the borders of Ukraine to know for sure what they're going to get.
Because there's a question all over the world right now.
Yes, the size is 10 to 11 years, but our size doesn't match.
I'm looking for everything for the house and the kids.
Thanks to the people I live in a chapel, they're always asking if I need anything, and I'm ashamed to say, I'm asking myself to find it.

According to European Truth, Well writes about this with reference to sources in government circles in Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 Gaubits, including teaching aids and spare parts, amounts to 1.7 billion euros.
And it's also offered in the 1.2 billion euros version of the Boxer BTR.
While tanks in battle have to climb relatively close to the enemy’s goals, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can drive fire over 30 miles [30 km] away.
As reported by the Ukrainian government circles with a link to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-started Hawaiians will follow a circular scheme.
The Buddesver will give Kiev 100 of its hubites in the shortest of terms, and the gaps that have been formed will then be filled with industry in the second phase.
The first new Hawaiians can be installed 30 months after signing the contract, or earlier than the second half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed by 2027.
Is this us in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you.

I just had to give it to the country today!
I didn't know even the big shops would be closed.
I'm making the doves this way: I'm making tomato paste in a pot of 0.5 liters of water, 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste, and it's going to cause boiling.
I put the doves in a pot and pour that sauce.
I've been smoking in the oven for about one and a half hours.
How much do I have on this room?
I've got to bring it all in.
On Monday four.
4. In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine may request humanitarian assistance at the new workplace of the Labor Administration in the Prague Market.
The branch office in Hall No. 29 is specially designed for giving and processing relief requests, so there is a translator on the scene.
Lydia's been brought to school, but we're going to go to school on Tuesday.
I'm sitting there, holding headphones on my ears, listening to music, and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I think we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there'll be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I can do a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what's going to happen to the apartment.
I need to be tested for the production of the food license, can I do it with you?
Please tell me to prepare the apartment for five guests tomorrow.
Is this the fifth place in the room with the TV?
Lay down and make the couch?
Will we stay with you while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
Not a new one that's been used, but it's a workman, but it's not necessary.
Write the Czech address, let's see on the map where this is from us.
I don't know how much free space there is, so I can't plan anything with furniture want this week to finally look at that apartment and then figure out what furniture I need.
I'm sorry I answered so long, it was a day, it's hard to adapt
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want you to finally be with you, to have this opportunity to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how you feel.
There's already a bed and a bath here for the child, something I found for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me if you could, but don't give me the last one.
I want to make a haircut called a hat.
Oleg's sick, sick and cough.
Only I'll be a little bit later - about eight o'clock. - May I?
I don't want a misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm worried everything's going well!
Because we haven't even talked about it with these excerpts!
I understand how important this is to you!
I'm still talking about myself.
How are you feeling today?
Hey, sorry, I just woke up, slept badly.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was upset that Collea and I started translating the test badly yesterday.
I'm going to ask whether Gregory Denisenka or Yoneszek) for some help with mathematical concepts.
Maybe there's something I can do for them, too.
If I can do that, I want to add mathematical terms in the weekend.
Geometry is actually difficult, but we have to work with the wheel to make sure that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the Test Jobs
That's what we really hope for.
She's very happy about any gift.
Yab wanted her Czech number to plug in the Internet.
Yesterday at the 402 bus stop, I met a Ukrainian woman named Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she's alone... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine to feel my heart is intrepid.
The branch office in Hall No. 29 is specially designed for giving and processing relief requests
Turns out I ordered a backup card.
No, I'm a simple man.
I don't want her to be afraid no one did.
You taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babin Yar Holocaust Center in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yaru.
I was privileged to speak after three heads of State, including the president of Germany.
He was talking about the "common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and secure Europe.
This foundation we must defend is also part of our responsibility to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!
The fight must last."
Today Russia attacks a peaceful country, bombes and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of the cities it blocks, and allows them to die of disease.
Russian troops have mass shots of Ukrainians, even visually similar to those of Babinya Yaru.
For over a month, the Germans have seen it in real-time news.
Yes, Germany implements measures, provides humanitarian aid, and also weapons that have not been imaginable for a long time.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than fighting the swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against massacres, genocides, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to conquer evil and stop the atrocities that take place in Ukraine.
One song for you tonight
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when to be gathered
All were sick only Lydia didn't get sick they had omicron a new kind of beetle
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
This is a ticket I'm using instead of a car.
Be aware of the lateness of the documents.
The ticket cost me 2,000 gums in the headmaster.
Sergey Sidorenko: Our NATO membership is no longer a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67 percent of the Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18 percent of those surveyed were in favor.
After the Ingredient Revolution, the flight of Victor Janukovicz, the Anexia Crimea, and the beginning of the Donbasi war, the number of NATO opposers began to fall, and, on the contrary, the ranks of the adherents began to grow.
Since the beginning of the full - scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have established a record level of support for Ukraine’s NATO approach among Ukraine’s citizens — over 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine's entry into NATO and the help it provides in war conditions, there is now a lot of criticism on the part of the state and the country members for the untimely supply of weapons, refusing to close the sky, refusing to irritate Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its desire to become a member of the Union because of the position of the FF if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will be given reliable security guarantees, including military guarantees.
In the new episode of the Podcast "The Curse of the Question" with the editor of "European Truth" we're talking about exactly how Ukraine has helped since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and why critics criticize, why our prospects for membership in NATO are closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in the negotiations with Russia can become the second Budapest conference.
What do you think is here
I have a volt partner saying that my application is under consideration.
I served it through this mobile plugin.
We don't have a visa, we have to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was made in Poland, where we didn't have a visa, but we gave it a pessipulation.
We'll write you a letter!
I went to Dennis in a good mood today.
I arranged for a boy from Ukraine whom I met yesterday to meet at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
'Cause I don't like it that way, I'm missing for a long time.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic sent T-72 tanks and infantry combat vehicles to Ukraine.
I'm going to leave the kids alone, waiting for three or four hours, and I'm going home because I can't leave them anymore.
And the brothers are six to seven in the morning.
Yes, there was a heart condition.
I had genuine feelings for this man, but he did not act very decently and I left him.
After a while, he returned and apologized to me.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he phoned that he had had a heart operation.
He asked me to talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During that time, we had many conversations.
I had a problem at work in parallel.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at it differently.
And he asked me to marry, and two days later he died.
Thus, God has made our own decision.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage to you?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to tell you that I was able to find a place to live, and I'm very happy that I have a place to live and a place to be with the baby.
Did I have to remember before?
( ) I was helping to see children in the family.
Just write the sentences you didn't understand.
I realize that the translator does not always translate the text correctly.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor, is she supposed to give the paper?
They must have forgotten, I put it in the closet.
Maybe it's time for you to go to bed to work tomorrow.
Can anyone help, the necessary things for a woman the size of XS or S the height of 165? And for her daughters the age of 8, 10,12. Thank you.
That time in the ice, I bought two packs and my mom bought two.
That's very nice of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
All right, let's talk about something else, and I'm not sleeping, I'm still asleep, and I'm dreaming of a bomb...
God is never late, his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:)
I understand very well the value of unqualified work, and I realize that the kind of work I had at home in Kiev I can't have here and the money I made at home, I can't get here now either.
But just sitting there and doing nothing, I can't do anything, because then all the bad thoughts go into your head, so you have to do something physical.
The airport will have documents from 7 a.m. to 7 a.m., and at another time you can just wait.
The Lord is back at 4: 00 a.m.
So we took them with us.
Vic and I slept in the kitchen, and they were put in the bedroom.
I'll finish the job and go to the airport with them.
When you have it, write and find out what's next...
I don't have a place for myself anymore.
Sir, please, these are Ukrainian children who are going to take part in the gymnasium.
Yeah, but I'm making it difficult.
Okay, write me when it's comfortable.
I don't know yet, I'd like to have kids in kindergarten and school.
Is it better if we change things sometimes?
I'm sorry, I really don't have any missed calls from Wednesday.
I'm offering work, cleaning the bathroom and the toilet, washing three windows, washing the dust.
It's about three or four hours, 800green once, Tuesday, Tuesday, 2:00 p.m.
I hope I'll just tell you we're good.
Can I call you?
Or could you write your wife's contact?
Grishka started coughing, and I want to ask you what I can buy from the pharmacy.
I'd like to ask you for some advice.
We have Anna as the root of the name Ania
She was handed over by her uncle from the house
Made the English version, made new partners
Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget me, please.
Are classes on Mondays and Wednesdays different?
Thank you so much, you're doing so much for our family, we're all so grateful.
It takes help to stay in the pool
But that's my opinion
My uncle handed her a roller skate and a torture board, and she was riding at home, so it's got
I also got up at 9: 00 p.m., and I'm just cooking breakfast now.
I'm sorry you're talking to me on your weekend, but I hope I'm not too annoying.
We want to report a change in the home and also submit further documents for the map
We're now taking medical oxygen to all hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you there's going to be lunch tomorrow.
One mother said she'd cook doughnuts for the kids.
He comes to visit you.
Please tell me, do you have an approximation of the cleaning of apartments a month ahead of you, even though for an approximate understanding of what days?
I won't remember that schedule.
The Russian army is threatening to launch rockets on Kiev, saying, "You haven't done that before."
Conashenkov's direct language: "We're trying to snare and target Ukraine's troops on targets in the RF area.
If such cases persist, the armed forces of the Russians will strike decision centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army had previously been held."
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kiev from the first days of the full - scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles that hit the Ukrainian PPO system fell on a apartment building in the capitals.
On February 26, a Russian rocket hit a large surface on Valerius Lobanowski’s Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit a television set on the Roads near Babinya Yaru, killing five passersbys.
On March 2, Ukraine’s PPO systems hit the Southern Railway Station with Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building.
On March 14, the wreckage of an invader’s wreck destroyed a house and a trolley bus in Korrenivsk in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a living mass on the Vinogradar, killing one person, and wounding another 19 people, including four children.
On March 21, Russia’s rockets destroyed the modern RETROVILE at Winocrate, killing at least 4 people.
The mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klczek, stated on April 13, that the people of the capital who had been evacuated from the city were still on their way back.
The army explained to the local authorities that Russians could still launch rockets on Kiev, and there were a great deal of mines and unbroken ammunition in the vicinity of the capital.
The main intelligence agency of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12, that the Russians were planning a series of terrorist attacks in the territory of the Russians to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the atrocities of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, a naphtobasa exploded near Belgorod in Russia, supposedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopter.
Early in April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that a "Ukrainian projectile" had fallen near the city.
Evidently, both the elites in Washington and Berlin are hurled into a cold sweat from the very idea that Nazi fighters would strike Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Greenski doesn't talk to them as much as to their voters and societies in general.
In his speeches in Parliament and before the thousands of crowds on the major cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader does something that none of his predecessors could.
Green doesn't convince European politicians to do anything for Ukraine; it convinces European nations that politicians choose.
And these talks, this elegant alloy of power, the touchingness and the time of despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
As long as the same Baiden categorically opposes the closing of the sky, 70 percent of his fellow citizens are supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels opposes Ukraine’s speeding up, this process is already under way.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered a swindler.
The baskets you collect are better to give to people who need more.
I can come over and we'll figure it out, but I'm still here to help.
But the air's clear, it's plus .
It says that I have a two-on-the-Internet fare, and I asked you to do the Internet.
I don't understand the terms of the fare.
Do we have any other room today, or, as usual, just the stairs from the top down?
So I'm on my way and you're on the train.
But I won't stop loving you, you're everything to me.
This loan is handled by a financial consultant.
So it takes a few days.
Katia asked for the Internet, can I give her the password?
I thought you and Milan didn't shoot each other.
Super, then my husband's gonna give me a ride because he has a car from the construction company today where he works.
We are so happy and grateful that our Nick and grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you so much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war, we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
one has to be cut into four sections.
one of these particles can be used for two or three days, but can be used every hour.
I'm interested in architecture and color.
I'm really glad you're all right.
At 4:20 p.m., the concert will start at 6: 00 p.m., and then I'll be free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet.
So I'll make tea and get some candy.
I went to the school page and I'm going to try and order Ani dinner for tomorrow.
But I love going out on weekends.
So can we go there tomorrow, find out the conditions?
My name is Sacha, and I came from Luhansk to Prague.
I'm a certified massageist and a 27-year-old nurse in neuroscience.
I'm offering medicinal massages, a rehabilitation gym for children and adults.
I speak English, Russian, and Czech intensively.
Contact: ---- I'd like a letter so the Czechs can write to you through a translator, they don't have a SMS here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, they won't agree.
You really don't want this price?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they have to do.
If you don't need a prime sheet, I won't put it in.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
Dorechi, you didn't want to write to me today.
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
Actually, I'm just asking for attention today.
I have so much to say today, so I ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, you go to work, you plan your shopping, you plan your vacation.
You have dreams.
You're planning to buy that dress you saw yesterday at the shopping center.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't understand that.
He's gonna chip for the old reality.
You call at work, see if you can go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something gets clear.
There's hope... it won't be long.
Now... they'll make a deal... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
I don't have anyone or anywhere.
I have $50 in my pocket, everything we spent at home.
Many of our superiors did not pay for our jobs.
Who needs me, how can I provide for my children, where can I live?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything from the house... you drive 1,000 miles.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you're dragging kids all over Prague.
I don't know, how long is it, but the kids ask for sweets, and you don't know, it's expensive.
And we don't have any of them.
It's our choice to stay there and alert our children to danger or to try to escape here.
She was very happy with those hearts and the things the kids gave her when she came to school.
You should have called me when you arrived.
I'll text you at dinner.
Yes, I believe only in God and I believe in my life
I don't have the strength to do this anymore.
I thought you were in love with some Ukrainian girl and you didn't have time to communicate.
I figured it out on the menu, I even ordered it.
2. Would you be interested in working with your Czech neighbors, friends, and community?
If so, what kind of species?
Please send a page with a visa or a driver's seal (red with a date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian aid.
Mrs. Libuche, did you pay for the carpenter?
Because I can't understand.
You're doing so much good to us.
We owe you a great deal... thank you!
Yeah, I know that's very good.
I'll send you a picture of the lady's card that I'm learning English.
I don't know if you're gonna write it tomorrow, see if you're gonna change your plans...
Good morning. We've got enough. It'd be nice to know someone from Ukraine.
If you want to, you can be with me after work.
You're busy tomorrow, don't you want to meet me after 4:00?
What are your general impressions from the first week?
Karina brought us the medicine the other day, and we drink them.
I can work with bedridden and disabled kids.
But I must say that I speak only Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.
Can I smear your foreground soap?
'Cause it's just an antibacterial hel.
I'm not sure, 'cause I'm not really in town yet... about half a dozen.
What services/activities do you think are needed/missed for the elderly?
I don't know because there was no text from the bank and I didn't take the bank cards, and the kids took the bank attachment and they made me very upset.
Then write me a letter when you're going to drive.
Today we have the joy of our city of Bucha being liberated from the invaders. Our troops have been spared.
There's a cleanup from the enemy, looking for Russians in the basements and apartments.
The whole city has been replaced, and the work of changing will begin.
And John would see if something needed repair or something else to do.
Diano, whatever you want, maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Panas wants to stay home, says he's tired of us, and he wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We'll bake the masan and do the lessons.
These are small businesses that have opened volunteer headquarters in their rooms and shops.
They're tractors who actually go to the field under fire, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree to go in rubber today to temporarily occupied areas to take relief supplies to and from there.
These are heroic leaders who, without fear, go into the war zone, calm and help refugees in the trains, and at peaceful stations, help volunteers to load a relief truck into the trains.
These were the gas stationers who stood on the Gitomir Road during the early days of the war and patiently ministered to frightened and nervous people.
These are the utility workers who carry garbage under fire, repair pipes, and power lines to provide for the needs of the people.
They're doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and they're still volunteering to pick up the first aid kit on the front.
In Ukraine, the juice stops when the little ones are leaves.
Please tell me, little kids-- what age do you mean?
My daughter is 8 years old, is that age acceptable?
I'm looking for a home for my daughter and me for three or four days every day to come to Czechia and pass on passports for a visa to Canada.
In Warsaw, there's a lot of people in the visa center and there's no on-line queue.
I wanted to come for a day, but it's a long way, it's a long way on the train, and it's going to be hard for the kid.
So I decided to look for a place to live in or near Prague.
No, we're fine.
Last night's instruments to bring in
But I can't change the password when I follow a link, because I get the following error:
It's in the microwave, something's burning.
In Ukraine, major bank operators are always connected to customers 24 hours a day, and all the issues are settled quickly:)
Nothing, I'll get used to new realities.
I don't like it, and I want you to know it.
You can edit the post, the most important thing is that it's true.
Yeah, TV's full of it.
We've already arranged for the refrigerators to come back by some Czech guys at 1:00 p.m. and help with the transfer.
I want to go to you, give you a strong hug, and kiss you.
at 7: 30 a.m., reading the history of the world's theater to actors, directors, and theater historians.
I appreciate the objects in the evening.
He's still sleeping, he's crying very much at night, he's got a tooth.
I'm on the phone right now with everyone I know from Lviv, and a lot of people died.
The Czech Republic began to issue a visa after March 22, according to me.
By that time, they had put images like this and then compared these images to a visa.
Ukraine’s foreign election district (U.S.A.) is an election district that unites the voting powers outside the territory of Ukraine, and consists of voting rooms at the Ukrainian ambassadors and consulates and facilities at military bases abroad [vinoca 1] where the Ukrainian peacekeeping campaigns (Cosovo and DD Congo) are located.[1] The circuit election commission for the Concordance Selector District plays the role of the Central Selective Commission.
In the foreign election area, there are only national elections: elections for the President and the People’s MPs, and countrywide elections.
Local elections are not held.
They're at the train station at the mother and child's room.
Says he doesn't know where they're going anymore.
Are you angry with me?
I'll get a picture in the bathing suit.
I don't need any more money. I borrowed a long term loan from a friend.
I wanted to say I've already plugged in the Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device to do that, so I went to O2 and they made me an electronic SIM card that I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
I'm very uncomfortable, Sunday works and I can't.
You said you had a broken washing machine.
We don't have enough blankets, we don't have enough blankets, we don't have enough plates. We don't have any pajamas, we don't have anything to move into.
Good morning, I'll be leaving at 10 o'clock. Write another address, there's a text missing.
I don't want to torture you or myself, I'm going to get in there somehow.
So it would be nice, but I know there was no free space, and in principle they now have all the lessons on schedule and they're teaching pretty good.
Do you have a meat cutter to make paint?
Let's do it after the big day.
Yesterday, did your mother say something hurt you?
She can't tell them what she wants, and not everything understands what they're saying.
I went to school today too.
I saw Kristina’s mother today, but she didn’t even say hello.
Very tasty apples, what kind of apples are they?
President Andrew Yermack's head of the President's Office announced that Russia is starting a "feasant operation" on the weapons that the Allies are handing over to us.
The direct language of Jermaek is, "They understand that they're losing war, they're seeing their backwardness, and they're trying to break up the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fags is the destruction of the S-300 tradition of Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
We know Russian scripts, one of them.
They can launch facials that the Ukrainian soldiers of Burkimto seem to have weapons from the Allies, and it is massively moving to the armor of the Russian army.
I'd like to warn you about those fakes.
For the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the U.S.S.A. are exclusively sending the enemy to that world.
I'm sorry, did I forget to ask you how much a garden would cost in the month and if it would work in the summer?
Everyone is given his strength.
There's a lot more sad stories, believe me.
So I needed to survive to change.
In the Torah it is written, and God created a wicked foundation in man so that during his course of life, he would change spiritually and become better
It's your house, you can invite anyone you want.
How do we find this lady in the social media tomorrow before we go to the hospital to visit the town hall?
He listened to Mom and didn't come with us.
I know it wasn't easy for you.
And I'll make you happy.
After what you wrote me today, I'm happy.
I hope you meant that seriously.
I'm looking at an announcement that's taken a lot. Now it's hard for us to do that.
I'm sorry, I didn't get the whole question.
Couldn't you call today about changing the mobile operator's fare?
I'm sorry, but I can't trust anyone in this life.
Today, I was offered a job every day.
I'm sorry, but I agreed to work there already.
Thank you for your response and wish you a good help.
Perhaps your father told us that there are Jehovah’s witnesses among us, but I do not practice any religion.
However, she was baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all religions that are based on religion.
I read the Bible, the Koran, and began reading the Torah.
I believe that there is no mediator between man and God.
Another way to think about it is not to put the refrigerator at the door of the boys ’ room.
Thank you very much. You really helped me.
We're looking for a typical house-cleaner here in the village.
Offer 150 crowns per hour, other cooperation with them, date agree with lady.
I'm afraid of chemical care.
I'm just worried about how we're going to talk to you.
But we can just look at each other. I'm kidding.
I went to my mother alone, and there my sister and her friend were going to go, and Anastasia asked them
Where's your good barber?
Good afternoon Victor approved this house only doesn't know how to help this gentleman with the documents to get pay from the airship and said that there is not yet a furniture bank there in the presence of furniture
I'm very grateful for the hospitality in your breast.
We've got good doctors here, too... bye.
We've already cooked food at home, and we can't find the keys from the top.
I'll take the underwear for the fifth guest, and the pillow and the extra one is in the apartment?
But as we get in touch with the owners, no contact, I need a long-term home, we work and we can pay, help me if you can.
At the end of each description, you have contact with the owner.
You can use this online translator from Ukrainian to Ukrainian and vice versa to communicate.
I'll have any, we're four on the same bed in a room where you can't even afford it, thank you very much.
Well, did you click the links I sent you above?
On each of these you have a free housing offer, a description, a contact with the owner and a photo.
I can't find any contact but an email, and I'm afraid I can't find anything that's closer to Czech Krumlov's job in Czech Krumlov and now we live in Prague.
Brna doesn't have a chance.
Thanks for the help, we found the apartment, but we need a bed and a couch, maybe you can tell us where you can buy it at a price, because our budget is weak, thank you very much.

The international community continues to express shock and indignation after evidence has emerged that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as “provocation. ”
“The reported deaths, rapes and severe injuries of Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians are worth the condemnation, ” declared Prime Minister Jasinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer the world for what they did, ” she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Prime Minister Fumio Kisida of Japan called the incidents “a violation of international law. ”
Reports were received that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Buchi, by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for a few weeks.
Photographs that supposedly depict the bodies of civilians who were executed with their hands tied together shocked many and led to calls for increased penalties against Russia and criminal persecution of the guilty.
President Emmanuel Macron of France announced in a radio interview on April 4, that there are signs that Russian troops have committed “war crimes ” in Butch.
“What happened in Butchi requires a new round of approvals and very clear measures, ” Macron said, adding that additional ones should be directed to Russian exports of coal and oil.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of Spain stated that Russian troops could go so far that they had committed a “genocide ” in Butch.
“We will make sure that those who commit these war crimes do not go unpunished, ” said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on public television late on April 3, Russia’s MSS spokesman Maria Zecharov rejected the charge as a “provocation. ”
She claimed without evidence that the United States and NATO had ordered an image to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made at the first minute after these materials appeared does not raise any doubt about who ordered the story, ” said Zecharov.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Defense also claimed, without evidence, that the Buchi image was “a further decree of the Kiev regime ” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called the "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Butch.
On April 4, Russia’s Follow-up Committee published a statement in which it declared “investigation ” for the charge of Ukraine’s spreading “knownly false information ” about the Russian forces in Buchi.
The president of Ukraine, Volodymire Greenski, spoke on April 3, accusing the Russian troops of committing “genocide ” in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they were to come to Buchi to see what their troops had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see their orders being carried out," said Greenski in videotape, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting at the ceiling," he said.
He stated that Russian president Volodymir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with arms tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don’t understand, ” he said about scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, a city about 35 miles [35 km] northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a reporter at the Ukrainian Service Radio Freedom saw a small town’s bodies on the streets as if they were civilians.
In just one place, the reporter saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists have seen at least 21 bodies in different places in Buchi.
One group of nine people -- all in civilian -- were scattered on the ground near a place that the local people said Russian forces were using as a base.
The victims seemed to have been killed from a nearby distance.
Generally, the Ukrainian authorities claimed that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the region of Kiev, which had been controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, it's all there, we bought it from the list.
"They said, "There's no Kiev."
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by horrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
There's another point in this list that's now much less information about -- the transfer of the local population to the enemy's territory.
From about the middle of March, Russian occupations evacuate Ukrainians from temporarily occupied communities to their territory and Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually committed to Russian military politics.
"Ukrainian Truth" found the exiled Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is happening and if there are ways to get back to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text were forced into voluntary evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Happily, they're alive and keeping in touch with their family.
However, in view of the claims made by the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So in Melitopole, the Russians kidnapped the personnel of the second delivery building, took the children away from there without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the lost Ukrainian champion of Joseph Zaczepinski's voyage.
Alexander's family, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valie moved to Guestomell a few months before the war.
Alejandro had just received a job at the Antonon Airport, about two miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in a military town, although it was a civilian.
As true plastics, Dennis and Marina had collected their anxious suitcases in advance, but in the morning of February 24 they didn't evacuate.
They didn't have their car, and suburban buses didn't take anyone anymore.
At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon of February 24, they saw helicopters with a Latin letter V followed by the first missiles.
One of them hit a neighbor’s house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 people were hidden in their cellar.
Not all decided.
"On the evening of February 6, 24th, people came in, speaking non-Spanish and non-Spanish.
They say, "Are there any?" -- I say so.
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were any guns.
All the men were questioned if they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We've come to protect you by Ramzan Kadir."
It was the Czech OMON, not even the army, the young boys in their 25-35s.
They said, "We've been helped in the war by the Ukrainians, Sasca White (commanded by the UNA-UNSO nationalist movement Viking, who fought on the Chechen side of the first Russian-Chechianic war - UP), and now we've come to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what was missing.
We say that the water was a big problem with her.
They broke up the store, took the goods out of there under the charge "all the equals will take away" and brought us six bouts.
There's also a video on the Internet where kids are thanking Kadir for the food.
So they brought the sausage after the robbery and they said, "We know it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatowitz."
No one particularly wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid says, "You have 7 days to give our phones," and they laughed.
They also kept themselves separate from the Russians.
They said it's a good thing they came because they didn't want wars, the Ukrainians are backed up, and the good ones are, "Putin's a bastard, Kadir's too, but there's nothing we can do, because our families are there."
And most of the time, they didn't fight, they went robbing shops, they were pillaging.
The chickens were put on, one was tied to one leg by a georgi tape, and the other was his white scotch, and they called it the Pole.
They arrived in Ukraine unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... when they were beaten in Butchi, so they didn't even take the dead, they asked us, "Do you have any artillery?"
More than that, we had built - up troops — the Chechens did not know each other, asked for passwords in the early days to find out whether they were theirs or not.
We had them by March 13, followed by a Russian OMN, followed by an Omsk paratrooper.
They put 30 to 40 units of hardware between the houses -- ours fell into it all the time with the Bayraktars.
But these came and told us that the ZMA is gone, but there's "Azov," and they say "Azov" is like 100 thousand in Ukraine.
I've been calling "Kyiv has surrendered" since early March.
One day a Russian came to us -- either an officer of the station or a representative of the FSB -- and said there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- it was about the Bush, the Hospital, and we thought maybe we had a green hallway.
From the beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostow."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
To which they said, "Well, feel sorry for your children's mentality!"
How it worked, they put us in the basement and started shooting from under the house -- or the Grads or the Minimettes.
And then it came back... and the neighborhoods just burned, and some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct touch on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over the border and the Red Cross.
Part didn't leave, saying it was for traitors of their homeland -- they said, "You're shot there, you're sold to organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, and the roads were hot, broken, even though the Belorussians told us that the Russians were moving to them immediately.
There's a lot of caponites, buried equipment, and soldiers.
At the White Sea Pass, we went through improvised control, many were without any IDs because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, and we were given tea.
And here we hear shots fired, a rocket fired, and we can see it was Iskandar working on Kiev.
Although these of the Belorussian Red Cross were saying, "Oh, no, these planes are flying, they're turning around on the border."
But we're from the airline, we have education, we know what this is.
Then we were loaded onto the bus and taken to the Chunkie Sanatorium near Goll.
His boss, Winger Vasil Stapagnaz, came, and said, "I'm a fork, I'm from Chernihov.
But I'm sure that Lukashenk and I won't stop until your thieves are dead.
Poor people!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
He's going to say it, he's going to do it."
They offered an interview to the Belarus journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration said to us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN (at least that's what they were called) spread misinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents -- she didn't have a foreign passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and the war broke out on Thursday.
At the Ukrainian consulate, we received no help, and at the station in Minsk, we were told that without passports, no one would get on the bus.
Let me tell you, we had a lot of help from the Belorussian volunteers.
We were placed in Minsk, and we were accompanied.
In the sanatorium, they didn't have any force.
Our second group of migration representatives said you could live here for a maximum of a week, because Belarus is not Europe, there's no payment here.
We found an internal transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled near Mozambique (about 50 miles [50 km] from Ukraine’s border – UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket first flew out, beautifully lit, and then turned off.
People who boarded a bus in Mozambique said that Russians were constantly shooting from Polygons there.
But I can say that the Belorussians don't want to fight at all.
The generals are being released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, does not believe at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
It is not understood that their polygons are used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we're going to register, we're going to decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are probably as much now as Estonian flags."
Marina lived in a military town in Guestomeli with her brother's family -- his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to gather the most basic items and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself couldn't go home and, in principle, she can't; the house's gone.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you go downtown on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. We're always waiting for you!
Thank you for the deal, the ropes are beautiful.
And in this little apartment, there's no wiki, and basically all of your questions are answered by me, and now I don't know what to do, and kids have online classes on Monday, and the Internet doesn't exist.

Can we make a deal about how best to do that?
On April 1, the city’s chairman, Anatoly Fedorook, delivered a joyful message that on March 31, the Ukrainian military freed the city from Russian invaders.
The next day the invaders were thrown out of the whole region of Kiev.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would have felt at that moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it was known that at least 280 civilians had been shot by the Russians alone.
They were killed on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back, some of them were teenagers.
The village chief, Olga Suchenko, her husband, Igor, and her son, Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23, were found killed and tortured.
Olga’s bodies and Alexander’s were in a brother’s grave, Igor’s in a sewer.
Obabitch, 20 km from Kiev, discovered the bodies of several stripped women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymir Greenski stated that certain types of armor that Western partners provide have arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, published by the Office of the President, he writes "European Truth."
"All the equipment, everything they're sending, for some kinds of equipment it's done too late.
So what, when we're talking, for example, about Mariupol, when you're losing thousands of people, and what now?
From leaders in some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the price of these changes," said Greenski.
To the question, it was enough weapons to make war difference to Ukraine, the president said, "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would be no war, or it would look different.
"She'd be different, we'd have close neighbors' shoulders, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be a war anyway," he added.
Remember, the Prime Minister of Great Britain has promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes bronze and anti-ship weapons.

There's a new girl in the garden today from Ukraine.
I didn't even touch the door, and she said.
If I understood Mr. Director correctly, he said that if I worked in the garden, I could come to work some day for as many hours as I could get.
If that's true, then I'll be able to, for example, a few days a week for a few hours to go out to work.
For exactly how many hours and days I'm going to watch as I get out of my house to be fashionable and to clean my apartments, there's more money for cleaning so I don't want to give up that job either.
I'm a water tech, so I feel the water flavor right away.

Marina, but really if you need help with the city, my husband and I are.
My friend and I baked last night, try it if you want.
All were sick, and they had symptoms, but we did not go to the hospital.
I just got a phone call from a woman in Dameidlo and said that they were e-mailing me with information about what was going on and I never answered.
She spoke Czech, and I understood her so much.
But I don't have a email from the ladies.
I need little flatteners to pull up the failure on the plastic.
Type or type of farm activity
We're looking for a house-cleaning lady here in the village.
Offer 150 crowns per hour.
Another cooperation is appropriate for pleasure.
The date will be settled with the lady on your own.
Sure, but I'm confusing you.
Men also have many nuances
He was a very rich man, but he liked me because I had my way of life. I met him, and then I left him.
He was a very wealthy man, and after a while he phoned and told him that he had had a heart operation.
He asked me to just talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought I might be his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he gave me a proposition.
"The car was standing in my yard, like a crocodile, and she opened the gates.
And they kept me in the house, and then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, and there was nothing to breathe.
And what about housing that you've been dropping pictures
I haven't really gotten there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already simplified this feat.
I'll see the last two videos when the Internet works normally.
Is there a dress code at work or not, or is it possible to walk in what there is?
All right, he'll come over there and pick them up.
I don't want anything
I understand I can't sit in you. I have to work.
I understand, thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or even Ukrainian television.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1 plus 1 is a pro-presiding, propaganda channel, not interesting to me at all.
What happened at the stop with the man who the police and the ambulance were coming?
Diane didn't answer me, and you did.
All right, I just need to print out the pictures for the kids, so it'll be fine.
But perhaps you need a more detailed knowledge of Czech.
I'm worried you'll be satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who's a Ukrainian, but he's studying in Czechia, a specialty of tourism.
You really don't want to come back with the kids for a minute, and you don't want to come back with your grandmother.
I want you to be with me, wake up next to you.
In fact, you are doing a lot of work in a foreign land, and every day you want to go home more and more.
Mrs. Agatha, if you want this picture, I'll take the picture.

"This whole month we hide from the infu mother-in-law of war.
For now, it's working.
However, the Puzzle (Cow - UP) has cluttered on its fare and hind legs — it can be stress, food change, and vitamin shortages.
The last two reasons have been removed, but stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The bottle, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Because Olga doesn't hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law spent the month living in an apartment with her "incognito."
And on April 1st, 93-year-old Oksana Paulov took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days I, like a guerrilla, lived with her in the apartment.
The war was hidden from it, and the fact that I was with her formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the receptionist -- she listened four hours, then she sang two hours."
The radio receiver was always at bed.
The mother - in - law spends most of her time in her room.
He hears bad, it lets me be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her tricksters, I would hide in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV.
Then I called everyone who was talking to her.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
It's April 17th -- I've got two apartments cleaned up:

A Britishman who defended Mariupol in the U.S.S.A. says that he is ready to surrender to the Russians
A British soldier who is a member of the U.K. naval infantry team involved in the defense of Mariupol told his friends and family that they would lay down arms and surrender to Russian occupations.
Source: twitter page of Adin Aislin, a British who has served in the U.S.S.A. since 2018, WBC, with reference to Ayslin's family and friends, Atlas News, with reference to the words of Ayslin's friend, who spoke to him
Twitter Aislin said, "We got a message from him, "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We don't have any food and ammunition left.
Thank you, everyone, I hope the war will soon end."
Details: Aycelyn served in the 36th S.U.S. Marine Corps, which is involved in the Mariupol Defense Operation.
The WBC reporters contacted En Wood's mother, and she confirmed that her son was on the phone telling her that they were planning to surrender.
A second soldier, Brennan Philips, also confirmed to journalists that in his last telephone conversation, Icelyn spoke about plans for their surrender unit.
He said that the crew had run out of ammunition and food.
The Atlas News columnists contacted a friend who said that Aislin's unit was about to surrender to Russian units so that it would not be without weapons and bullets to the hands of the so-called "cadifiers".
Also on the social media was an audio recording of the telephone conversation, at which Acelyn was supposed to be talking to an American friend who was planning to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Ayslin said that they were trying to get out of town with civilian clothes, but they failed.
A Britishman told us earlier that in Instagram, he was threatened by representatives of a private military company called Wagner.
Aislyn was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015 - 2017 he went to fight against the terrorists of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the VSA and made an oath.
Aislin's friends and loved ones called Johnny, and in the social media, he's more famous for Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know if we're together or not.
But it won't be easy, you'll have to find him...

I am not afraid of work, as I lived in a village, so I can and do work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition, and we do that for Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved the 7176 legislation, which is called "In order to monitor potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic field."
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics has been... the place where the oversight board of companies and banks sits.
Initiators of legislation believe that making decisions by a company’s governing body in conditional Kiev can somehow solve Ukraine’s national security problems.
We know that there's a lot of new dangers to the companies, but we don't know yet about any company that needs to be physically meeting the board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is an excellent basis for getting rid of everything in the difficult reform of the institutions since the Revolution of Greed, including independent oversight by the Council, and then setting up manual management.
That's what it was before 2015.
Why should the board keepers, and who should join them?
And what's more, if under patriotic slogans one harmful legal agent flies off, then tomorrow others can fly off -- for example, the state buying system can be broken through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
There's a lot to be written off for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the legal agency, 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this rule was included in the comparative table of 5397.
In general, the desire to dissolve the board in one way or another has been circulating among some national electors for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism, but for the sake of showing the possible effects of a legal entity, let us consider the reasons why it was necessary to accept it.
And then we'll give you our suggestions on how to solve the issues of managing the institutions during the war.
The first deputy minister of the economy, Dennis Cudin, explained the need for such innovation with the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication that would prevent the remote work of the board of oversight.
In other words, the risk is that the board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which could result in a paralyzed company.
We agree that such a risk is involved, but will he be able to prevent members of the oversight board from moving to Ukraine?
Imagine a very cynical situation when independent board members (who make up most of the staff) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
If so, they can be set free by law.
And then, most likely, it's going to lead to the loss of the quarrum, the necessary oversight to make any decisions.
On the other hand, it will not work quickly to appoint new independent board members, since the law requires a competitive selection that lasts an average of three to four months.
Hence, a decision proposed by the lawmaker, 7,176, is likely to prevent the oversight board from losing its ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to it!
The People’s MP, author of Dmitri Natalah’s law, provides other arguments for his support.
In particular, he points out that “many businesses, such as the defense and industrial complex (OPC), are now in need of relocation” and therefore“it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, talk about addresses and other sensational information from Vienna through Zoom. ”
For starters, there is little PKK in Ukraine that has oversight of the board.
The board of oversight is only in the UPC, which essentially manages almost all of the PKK facilities.
But even in the Ucroboron Propaganda, according to the legislation, the board has quite limited powers, and all its members carry out duties on a non-free basis.
The full power of Ucroborrome belongs to the director general, who, by the way, will make a decision as to the need to reconstitute an OCC that is part of the company.
Moreover, such an argument does not withstand criticism either, for the legal entity 7,176 does not make any changes in the legislation regulating the OCC.
On his Facebook page, Mr. Dmitri also cites arguments that can be classified as “emotional. ”
Such arguments tend to have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of companies and banks, but let's try to figure out some of them: "the respected foreign experts at the first word "war," leaving Ukraine back in 2021, but remain members of the oversight board in Ukraine's public businesses with a total salary of several hundred thousand dollars, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from war."
First of all, it's a manipulation -- most of these board members never lived in Ukraine and only came here periodically.
So it's not fair to say that they're leaving Ukraine.
Second, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian board members have long been using online sessions.
It is a tool that has long been widely practiced in the world, with a wide variety of fields — business, education, medicine, and so forth.
And we should not forget, too, that membership in the oversight board is not a full-time job.
They usually have other things to do, and these are the means of electronic communication that help them to do that.
Third, all these statements are read as claims only to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitri not make identical claims to members of the Watch Tower Council who are Ukrainians?
After all, they're not in the same position as their companies.
In fact, this is not the first populist attempt to remove foreigners from the oversight board, and war is only a new opportunity.
Congratulations, I'm in Ukraine, and I'm looking for options to protect my family temporarily, and I have two children with me.

We usually need an adult's passport.
In the region of Kiev, Bróvarsk, Vishgorod, and Buchana, which were freed from the occupation, an increased curfew of 2 days will be established.
Paveluk's direct language is: "In the towns of Brovarsk, Wishgorod, and Buchana Districts, which were under Russian occupation and freed by the Ukrainian defense forces, the commandant's hour was increased!
In the area of these cities and villages, restrictions will be in force from 9 p.m. on April 2 to 6 p.m. on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the siege, traffic and walking are strictly forbidden at this time.
Inhabitants can only go out on alarm signals to escape.
Such restrictions are imposed to eliminate the effects of Russian aggression – to clean and displace territories.
Omelanek called on the people who had left the area for the time being to refrain from returning home.
At the end of Kiev, the curfew will last from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day.

Lucacenca’s bulwarks have been held for three long 27 - and 28 - year - olds, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of an Osipwitch signal to ensure the movement of railroad trains.

On the night of March 30, three residents of Bobroujsk were arrested for special force support.
It's clear that at the time of the arrest, the men were actively resisting and trying to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the prisoners was injured and is in a hospital.
Others were given on - site medical care.
The head of the Bilorussi Police Department, Hennadi Kazakevich, stated that "the terrorist attacks on the railroad will be severely stopped" by the armed forces.
On April 6, it was reported that on March 30, the police arrested another Belorussian railway officer, a fellow Baranovic BDZ, and the BDZ topical resource administrator in Vkontactie and "Sentitors" by Valentine Samasuk.
Where he is now and where he is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
By the end of March, at least 40 railroads had been detained in Belarus for sabotaging.
Recall that the formation of the BYpol, declared by the Lukashenka regime to be extremist, continues to call on the Belorussians to disrupt the railways and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the Peramoga plan.
The Belarus "track guerrillas" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As we know, through Belarus, the Russians are moving to Ukraine to fight, living power and technology.

The U.S. bans investment in the Russian Federation and imposes penalties against the daughters of Putin
The United States, along with G7 and the EU, has introduced new measures against the daughters of the President of the RF Putin, the largest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and Sberbank, and has banned all new investments in Russia.
This is reported on on the White House website.
Sierbank is Russia's largest financial institution, which is owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets that apply to the U.S. financial system, and ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will completely ban new investment in the FM.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Byden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on an approved decision by over 600 multinational companies to leave Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, big retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as legal and consulting firms,” is in White House's statement.
A third step in the new United States was restrictions on large Russian state companies in the critical field.
This would ban U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The detailed list of Minfin will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the total blocking of the assets of the adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the foreign minister Lavrov, as well as the members of the Security Council of Russia, including the ex president and prime minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Mishutin.
Sanctions shut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, then the drive's closed, and I'll come to you.
Vera, can we wash the dishes in the car now?
My name is Olga, and before the war, I was a flight attendant for SkyAp, and my mother was an industrial sewing mother, and Makarczyk's son went to kindergarten.
We lived beautifully, but we did not even think we would be forced to flee because we were no longer able to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and found work in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we hope that someone will take care of us for the first time) we can even pay for a room or an apartment, but if it's in our pocket.
Cleanliness and order are guaranteed.
We do not have harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such help at such a time that we cannot afford.
After lunch, I had a lecture in English, and then I went to work in the children’s room.
I explained to Margaret how to fill in all the documents.
I hope she understands and will do well.
I also met Mrs. Lena with her and talked about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.
It's a free swim.
You can call the school, Cyrus doesn't pick up the phone, doesn't answer, I don't know if she got to school.
They isolate the Russian office: they stop investment and stop supply.
However, we did not understand.
The army did not join us in our home.
Our home is near the military unit and the naphtobasa.
He just helped me because I couldn't do it on my own.
I cook well, I don't ask too much, and I give good advice
I'm doing my best.
It's a little hard for me, but I realize that I have to go through this stage.
I'll meet you on Thursday and tell you everything.
Everything's fine.
Goul, how often do you clean up?
I clean up every week.
I'm sorry I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I Dreamed of Being a Teacher
My girls can't move anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you that if you hear information about housing, you'll let me know.
I'd be happy to rent a house with a decent girl.
If you can know that, let me know.
For my part, I won't let you down.
Thank you early.
I didn't write you another person for 54 years. Please write you an exact address and how much the course costs.
I think you'd better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I haven't changed my last name, it's one from birth:)
Mr. Reyard, I'm sorry I didn't see it, I'll do it and I'll send it to you right away.
We're going to a medical commission.
I mean, we don't have to work this hour on another day.
What day would it be better for her to come early? (May it be a little more work on what day?)
I'll listen to you tomorrow, the Internet is bad.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thank you. We found something out of the stuff, but there was nothing in the technique.
Both beginnings, except for the abbreviation
Nothing's happening.
Can I go on Monday, 2504?
You can take the kids with you, the toys are enough here:)
Guessing About Dad
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'll think of something with that money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how will this be paid, please, no loans.
Write me straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.
Do you have to take the clothes you gave me?
Today's not my day. The blinds in the living room are broken. One morning.
Something came from you, I can't see
I'm very sad too.
I'll remind you of the fact later
Is your dad the only one who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to clean the house, and how many windows does the house have?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you, there's a message from Mariupol for his son alive and in line.
I'd like to read to Joe Dispensa, and he's doing scientific research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections.
Natalya Nagorna, a newsmagazine of Channel 1+1, published this morning on April 12, a video that she received from the 36th Marine Corps in Mariupol.
In it the soldiers say that there were no weapons left in them to fight, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said, "count goes for an hour."
Earlier, on April 11, 36, a separate Marine team involved in the defense of Mariupol published an appeal to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last fight for Mariupol's supporters, and the Ukrainian military command hadn't been in contact with the fighters for two weeks.
In the social media, skepticism was expressed that the statement was published in Russian.
Chief Commander Valerius Nebuchadnezzar of Ukraine's armed forces assured us that the commands of the defense forces in Mariupol are connected, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the Azovtal factory in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupations dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to Azowa leader Andriy Bilecki, the Russian army has used chemical weapons against the Azovstal factory, which is holding the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I'd like to fit in on you.
It's the same situation as staying here for now.
2 hours of driving ) outdoors, Mom shopping and backing!)
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she was gonna do here.
Czech ʼDron squadrons have now begun flying over Ukraine.
Nearly 50 professional Copters will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to destroy the enemy invader directly.
Two Czech “birds ” and two Czech brothers were sent to Ukraine before yesterday, thanks to the deputy of the Mukachev city of the town of Volodymyr Lubutenka.
Today, their intergean friends, led by the village council manager and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/exampleher101/ Vasil Szour, delivered the drones for their purpose: they were given special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting is currently under way.
For the sake of the most efficient and safe use of coppers, where they are placed, we're going to leave them in the dark for the moment.
Four friends who help the Czech army stop at what they've done say that within the next few days, there will be many more interesting “gifts ” that will serve to destroy the Russian occupation and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
It's okay, I love sweet, but I can do it without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine soon, going to work.
All right, if it's okay, I'll do it.
I'll try to do it myself, but if I get stuck, I'll write you, if I can?
The Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the old lady's village in Yiviv, she saw me and said I was pregnant but said there was no housing.
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll feel better.
I got my phone fixed today.
And I think I'm cold on the street today.
I've had medicine and tea, and I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry, too, but I'd rather meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, drop the music you like.
I'm interested in what you've got to do with music.
Mom and Dad Need to Be Obeyed
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
It's been colder and raining here today, and it's supposed to be warm tomorrow.
But it's not a pity the houses are destroyed, the people who are being bullied by the invaders
In Herson, the occupiers were mocked by the Memorial of Glory Ukraine in Herson on the street of Peropodsky.
Details: It is reported that the unknown have torn the flag of the European Union, torn the panels with photographs of the Celestial Hundred and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The occupiers tore down the portraits of the heroes of the Celestial Hundred and the dead participants in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The flag's down.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for the wheelchair, we don't have that custom, so we didn't know, we gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe there was something else we needed to give.
There's someone in Czech to talk to.
'Cause I live in a dormitory like this, up to twelve people will be here, and then they'll go to work.
Hey, it's a little bit better.
I was in the manger today.
Even today I've been sleeping there.
That's why we're making great progress.
I'm sure I'll bring cookies another time!
I don't have the strength to do them today.
Since I push away from the days and times of cleaning after the guests, I can say something about April of the month because I already have an approximate cleaning schedule.
By May of the month, I could say about it at the end of April or early in May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hey, I'm sorry I haven't been making dinner for a while and I've had some sleep.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
Or I'll meet you after you've arrived.
He's modest, he's been learning a lot lately.
Hi, it went very well.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people in such a high position.
I had a lesson today with a lady who is the director of the economics department of the highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
The garlic in the manger was doing well.
On Monday, I have to bring in confirmations of employment as well as cash for the carpentry.
I've been on my way since Friday.
I don't do anything but do a lot of them and sleep ʼ (and drink a lot of water ʼ)
If he goes to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you, if you can.
I've got to deliver another analysis.
You don't have to go again.
It's not working well, it's washing, it's not working well, it's needing a master, it's got to be fixed.
That's all there is.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I'd like to send you an invitation to attend the Czech language course you have enrolled in.
And the children are fed there, or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment, there's one question I can ask you.
If you need a help, write
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating the Passover today, right?
From the beginning, we didn't really want you to raise money, so people don't think we're hot on it!
But I didn't have two things to fill out online:
I'm going to go to bed, get my strength, get my energy, and thank you for the present.
I'm going to watch the video and it's going to be good because the whole family is going to draw.
The University of Carazine urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not trust anonymous sources in messaging and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Only focus on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in the country is also helping the army.
I've got some papers for the portfolio.
After the holidays, we have to do the Internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How do I count the day I wasn't at work is a pass
Summary of headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transdinastrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighboring state."
It says, "There is no exception to the armed forces of the Russian Federation of Provocative Actions in the territory of the Predinaster Republic of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
Details: The Adversary continues to create an offensive group of troops for action on the Slobosian course.
In the nearest days, the invaders will likely try to resume the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and ship the personnel, armor, and equipment for fighting in Ukraine.
Training is being done for weapons and military equipment at the post of the 60th separate Moto Arrow team (Monastery) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military Region.
It is likely that the marked weapons will be transferred to the temporarily occupied area of the Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the loss of the individual unit of the Battalion Tactical Units of the 36th single Moto Arrow team (Borgia, Zabaykal country), 29 general army troops from the Eastern Military Region are being recruited from the assigned team.
A particular problem is that the enemy feels it's when he compiles the positions of driver and driver mechanics.
The departure of the selected individual from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April of this year.
The opponent, in order to disrupt the delivery of trucks to combat sites, will likely continue to strike the transport infrastructure in Ukraine for the purpose of destroying or disabling them.
Defined divisions of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the tasks of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Blorussian border in the Brest and Gool oblasts.
On the Slojian side, separate units of the 6th General Army and the coastal forces of the North navy continue to block the city of Hardkow, and carry on artillery shellings of individual areas of the city.
Izmmysk is in the air raid for the purpose of detecting the positions of the armed forces of Ukraine.
The opponent uses the Orlan 10 BLACK to do this.
To two Battalion Tactical Groups, the enemy tried to attack in the direction of the towns of Longen and Dmitrychka, without success, and withdrew to the previously occupied positions.
On the Danish side, the main efforts continue to focus on taking control of the towns of Popasna, Rubizina, Lower and Novobahmutka, as well as full control of the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to raid the Golden region, and he didn't succeed.
In the city of Mariupol, by means of artillery and airlines, the occupation forces continue storming in areas of the Azovtal factory and the seaport.
The enemy fired artillery fire on Ukrainian troops in the areas of the towns of Hescoboville, Trulovatsk, and Mariyansk.
In the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukraine's supporters have fought four enemy attacks over the past day, destroyed five tanks, eight units of reserved equipment, six units of car hardware, and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't you understand what you're thinking?
We'll usually try to make it, but I doubt it.
And you can't sleep and I'm holding you up.
Are you sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see each other today, so tell me, I'll understand.
We didn't watch TV at home, and we don't have to adjust :)
I'm going to turn on the TV just to listen to Czech.
I'm running out of a month's fare today:
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buying weaving cloth, weeds, weaving threads
I understand, I can prepare the material in this field.
I'm a little ashamed to ask, she's giving us a lot of pies.
I'll see my dad later, sure.
I've read the statement in Facebook, so Google must have written something in his own way. > I think the phone numbers are enough.
Good afternoon, we're the things that you brought, but there are things that we can use for 10 minutes to bring them to you?
I was thinking about work.
If Mr. Director has an appointment, I can start going to work next week, because tomorrow afternoon I plan to go to the office of work to get the papers (if I want to, because the queues are too big) and Saturday rain:
I'm looking for a team at the beginning, and I liked chemistry at school, learning Czech to know perfectly, the dream of working on Teva.
Friends are old and small, friends I don't know personally, friends with spirit and mind.
Now you too have faced difficult times.
During the last month, I've been talking to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from foot to head, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that they feel guilty and ashamed because of your country's actions toward your neighbors.
Because they're giving up Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been in danger for a long time, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote Alexander Cherkasov, a very old friend of Memorial.
Let's tell you a little bit later -- as usual, Sasha answered in a simple way.
Others -- artists, artists, critics, writers -- are amazed at the sudden collapse of your tiny world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of a very few of you -- those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Newspaper, in the Echo of Moscow, in the Meduz, in the Navall organization, and in a number of other places -- how many of you have done anything to counteract this regime?
Except participating in the rallies while they were still going on.
Also read the column of Russian journalist "It's Too Late to Hide, It's Too Late to Silence."
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is more than abstract?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive participation, which may now be a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like that.
In the 1990s, there was a brief period when you had to some extent a freedom and a democracy -- a messy, even bloody, but real one.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you have a revolution, you're finally engulfed by such a fear of sorrow that you're looking for salvation behind the king's back, let's say his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel safer around him.
Yes, mistakes were made.
Instead of taking and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did in the stamp, you took your soul to the monument of Dzerzynski -- and allowed the KGB to lie low, refreshed, reformed, and take control of the country.
When you were faced with a choice between the country’s robbery and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for a third option – and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and it marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechen.
Survival was a major concern.
Then there was Putin, young, entrepreneur, aggressive, and he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you have bought it, but either you voted for it or you prefer not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechen again with the earth, most of you closed your eyes.
I remember those years.
I was working in Chetchni, helping the victims of the Putin "antiterorist surgery," and I saw with my eyes the ruins of Grozny, Katar-Yurta, Itum-Kala, and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Bred, we're fed up with your Chechen." I remember those words very well.
In reply, I resented, "My friends, this isn't my Chechen, this is your Chechen.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your power that will bomb one of your cities, kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic upturn in the middle of zero, caused by the rising oil prices and the willingness of Putin to look at the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made a good living, some have been rich, and even the poorest of you have purchased a new home and found a better job.
Prices went up, but what's wrong?
Moscow shining and shining from its neck.
When a number of opposers were killed -- George Szczekochina, Anna Politek, Alexander Litwinenk and others -- many of you were shocked and appalled about what was going on.
However, the matter did not go on.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the position of president Medvedev and sat down as prime minister, I see you've barely noticed it.
When Medvedev Russia invaded Georgia after a few months, most of you ignored or silenced it.
How many of you did I meet in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudaury, in the underhills of Kazbez, or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilis, while a part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit, it's unlikely that we've done much in the West if we've done anything at all.
A little indignation, a little sanctivation; but what was the significance of Russia’s gross violation of international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and domestic market was so great?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the hard 1990s, that was the most important thing.
But at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, woke up.
When Putin again swapped places with Medvedev and sat down as before, many of you decided that this was too much, and you mass protested.
Nabal's name became pronouncing, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt terrified that it was losing soil under its feet.
Afterward, he struck back.
Initially, alternative action was organized, and more oppressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have received huge terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The guard is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angrily by the pro - Russian president, who deceived their European expectations, they once captured Maidan – and never left him again.
They built a tent town on their own and prepared for decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they defended themselves with sticks, armor, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters came under attack.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitive was Janukowicz, and the Ukrainians restored democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and to expel them if they were doing wrong.
Maidan was very displeased with Putin.
That was a bad example.
So using the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but the benefits are few.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91 percent of Russians supported anecsia.
From somewhere else, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putina and his gang suddenly returned 180 degrees and began venerating him.
I find it difficult to find a reason, since right after that, we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We don't care about politics," you said.
And you hid yourself in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, away as new after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow started in 2012, with their binbees, their public wips, and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's only getting better.
You've just drawn attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't there?
IDILE or whatever, even the Moscow editor who released my book about Syria criticized it in an interview, because I didn't understand much about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I saw the state snipers shooting cold-blooded at my children's peers on the streets.
Among all Russian citizens, there were only your soldiers who started bombing thousands of civilians in 2015 with experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came for the socialists, but I didn't say anything because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came to the union members, but I didn't say anything because I'm not a union member.
Then they came after the Jews, but I was silent because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything to protect me."
How many of you were talking about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority said nothing.
Some really say now -- like Dmitri Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the interior of the country like Marina Ovsalnickow, risking entering the new GUALS or putting up a company called Nabalny.
As for others, you know best where you live.
So, I'm sure you understand, when Putin deals with the Ukrainians -- or what seems very likely if he doesn't, he'll take it for you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who courageously but mostly privately protested and still took place in a very short time, but soon they'll get more serious.
For thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed dissent in social media (let's only say the black square in Instagram), or who have spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of disfellowshipping were given just for anecdotes are not in such a distant past -- and now they are very likely to look forward to you in the future.
Who will speak for you, who will remain?
The example of the Ukrainians -- even more than the year 2014 -- frightens the Putin regime: they prove that they can fight it.
And that intelligence, motivation, and courage can stop it, no matter how oppressive its advantage is.
In view of everything, few in Russia realize this, as well as that war is going on.
But you, my friends, know exactly what's going on.
You read news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know what's going on.
A good life in exchange for your silence ran to the end.
Your choices are just chuckle, your laws, if you don't think about the oppressive ones, are worth no more than the paper they're writing on, your last free media are gone, your economy is breaking up faster than I'm writing, you don't have credit cards to buy plane tickets abroad, even if there's still some other flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence; he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to go or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you can see another option.
Still, there's another one left.
Which will eventually bring this regime to ruin.
And maybe in the circumstances that you're in, you're going to need less of you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark is not going to explode from you: because of the economic collapse that's taking place in Russia, it's probably going to burn in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices go up and wages don't pay, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will get out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you my friends.
But if each city goes out to a meeting by itself, as has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for it to suppress them alone.
We're going to need an organization and a coordination, and we're going to need to turn the crowd into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool, the Internet, that can limit the mode, but it's still working and that can be set up under almost any circumstances.
Nabal’s organization has been demolished, but you can create other, more informal, more deconcentrated.
There's a lot of you, millions of you.
Moscow’s police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If it's over 300,000, it'll be astonished.
We're going to have to use an army, but will this army fight for Putin when it gets to work?
After everything he made them go to in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will experience a clear fear; and those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid if I were you.
In Syria and now in Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their masters, who dare not only demand freedom but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son's going to put a joke on a computer game chat -- and he's going to be arrested; your daughter's going to express indignation on the Internet -- and he's going to be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake -- and die in a raw cell under the police clubs.
That's what's been going on for many years -- and it's only going to get worse and bigger and bigger and bigger.
If you don't do anything, you know what's going to happen.
Act in cold blood, think strategicly, and make it a reality.
We were at class on Friday, and we were told we could come on Monday.
We'll be home tonight.
That you see me as a secretary's press.
Viko, how often do you go to dinner at a fancy restaurant?
I go to dinner at a fancy restaurant once a day.
I'll try to explain everything to her.
So we liked it very nice and we wanted something better, so it's a better choice.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people.
I feel bad, coughing, temperature, voice loss, weakness and head spinning.
I have to go to that government of labor
We've already done that, but we told you who registered in April with money only at the end of the month.
We need a pass on Thursday, and we'll go with the kids to the doctor.
But at night I was writing to a lady who liked your work, and she would want something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her, and I'm sure I'll let you know.
Working at the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental job that I was completely disappointed in.
It's a pity for your time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am communistic, but I am serious about singleness and marriage.
There was a man I had to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that to create a family, people must love, respect, trust each other.
I haven't met that one yet.
Where can you get a piece of paper or a silicon in his office?
All right, thanks for the advice, I'm going to get a Vala certificate.
She's got a child in bed, now she's got a broken leg in her hips, a wheelchair in her bed, and she's all rubbed in her blender.
Mr. Reyhardt, I'm sorry to bother you at a time when you're not working.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie's playroom today, to say hello to her.
She had a bad situation.
Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to take the child away because she said she came to look at the things and put them in that room with the clothes and Mr. Valerius yesterday opened our children's room until 7:00 p.m.
Is that really the case?
The working time of the room is 4:00 p.m.
Finally, it is our responsibility.
