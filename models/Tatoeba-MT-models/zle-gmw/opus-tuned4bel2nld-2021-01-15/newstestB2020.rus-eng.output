The Kazans in the Russians' championship suffered four successive defeats, as well as a flight out of the Cup.
We're geared to every game, and they're quoting "The News" of the Grave.
So each of us needs to think about the reasons for such a bad match.
We have to get ready for them and fix the situation.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably have fixed it by now.
But first of all, I think we need to add to the component of unification.
In my view, we have a problem with that.
The Kremlin supports the ban on smoking on the balconies of homes
The Kremlin supports any action that will save lives, said President Dmitry Peskov's Spokesman, commenting on the ban on smoking on the balconies and flats.
Previously, the Kabmin had approved a change to the Fire Regulations, which prohibited the use of open fire on the balconies and the rooms of the homes.
Later, the Russian MES reported that this included a ban on smoking on the balconies and flats and hotels.
The changes will take effect on 1 October 2019.
The breach is subject to administrative liability.
In the Kremlin, they have a positive view of any decisions that help save human lives.
"We know how many fires occur, many of them have very tragic consequences and social resonance.
So any life saved justifies a decision like this,' said Sandov.
First of all, the Spokesman views it as a fire-fighting measure, not a way to protect his neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not welcome smoking and was a promoter of a healthy way of life.

China strongly opposes the adoption by the US of the Taipei Bill.
China strongly opposes the adoption by the US of the so-called “Tai Bay Bill,” which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the State Council for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.
The approval by the U.S. Senate Committee on International Relations of the bill is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and a grave interference in China's internal affairs, noted Ma Xiaoguan.
He said that Taiwan was part of China, and the issues involved related to China's internal affairs.
“We call upon the American side to clarify the situation, to immediately stop the relevant negative bills, and to immediately cease to interfere in the Taiwan question in order to avoid further damage to China-United States relations, as well as to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he noted.
China must and will be reunited.
This historic trend cannot be halted by any force, as Ma Xiaoguan pointed out.
TikTok hides bad videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world is over 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Imagine China/Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok censored videos that refer to Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence, or Falun Gong's banned religious group, explains The Guardian.
The paper states that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is an app that promotes China's foreign policy objectives abroad.
The bulk of China's policy-related violations fall under the “incitement of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok puts unfavorable publications in a context that fits the general rules, so that the actions of the social network do not look like censor.
For example, the ban on criticizing China's socialist system falls under a general ban on “criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “discussion of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the banned names of the 20 “foreign leaders or statesmen” including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sen and Kim Jong Eun, the Indian policy of Mahatmu Gandhi, the American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the South Korean President Park Kyung Hee, the Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by social media administrators and may result in a blocking of the user.
The second category is not too strict: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to the TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that the rules were obsolete and no longer applied: “We are now using a localized approach to the modernization, as well as engaging independent local experts.”
Russian users of TikTok do not have specific restrictions on the publication, as the co-founder of the "Producer's Centre" by Rustem Bogdanov.
The "Producer's Centre" is a Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the bloggers' ads at the "Producer's Centre" are in contact with social media, but the user's material can be posted without a harmonisation, and it is handed over to the Bogdans.
Asking if TikTok can talk about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers yes and says he's seen similar publications.
The founder of the Our Digital Agency, Roman Zaripov, agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for the users of TikTok list in the user agreement: you can't put shocking content, discriminating speech, etc. ".
But under these rules, you can get any content that the monitors don't like, notes Zaripov.
Zaripova is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world is over 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Under the user agreement, only persons over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
The social media administrators test their age with artificial intelligence: neurosis analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks, tells Bogdanov.
If the neurose decides that the user is younger, the account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow in September 2019 on the territory of the WeWork Coworks.
The people of Istanbul spoke of the earthquake in the city
A severe earthquake caused a panic in the largest city of Turkey
Last Thursday, 26 September, an earthquake of 5.9 magnitude struck Istanbul.
Thirty-four people have been injured, ten of whom are still in hospitals.
A resident of Istanbul, Melika, confessed to having had a panic attack for the first time in her life.

She was crying right in the work place.
Later, it became easier, and I went back to business.
But I'm so ashamed right now!' said the girl to TV channel 360.
"In Istanbul, there was a real big earthquake.
I can't go back till now!
But in general, I'm fine" - shared his impressions with politician Jalan Ozgül.

In Roshavinadzor, the results of the amputation test were reported to the child.
A child in Rostov oblast was amputated because of a doctor's error, reports "View" with a link to the website of the Rostov observatory.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm, and he was given a gips at the Zernograd district hospital.
After a while, the baby developed gangrene and was amputated.
The audit found that there had been irregularities in the timeliness and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as in the standard and the amount of assistance provided.
The verification material has been transferred to the Russian CC by region.
URA.RU had previously reported that the head of the Southuranska Grand Hospital had been arrested.
The Russians have been warned of false calls from the banks.
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters that replace the bank's phone number has increased.
This is reported by Commersant with a reference to the Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator handed over to the telecommunications operators more than 2,500 numbers from which the clients of the various financial organizations had been called.
In 189 cases, the operators found a subset of the number.
An additional 218 numbers had been blocked, and in 59 cases a limit had been placed on the use of financial services.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the CB, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks had been involved in the switching of the number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings of fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such a duty in the Communications Act.
At the opening bank, Rosbanke and the Alpha bank confirmed an increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a subset of the number.
According to the Bilaya Press, some of the information on fraudulent calls that had been given to the CB was incorrect: the lists included numbers that were actually used by banks to communicate with clients.
Their blocking would have led to disruptions in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank was planning to create a database of fraudster numbers, to which the telecommunications operator would refer at each call to check the number.
He explained that such a basis would require amendments to the law.

According to the agency, this was the case during the Russian elections of 8 September.
The facts of the violations were referred to the State Committee.
Later in Google, the company was said to support responsible political advertising.
In the view of the staff, it is bound by the laws of the country.

Stoltenberg discussed with the Green Ukraine's accession to NATO
The NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, discussed Ukraine's membership in an alliance on the margins of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
He spoke about it at Columbia University in New York.
In response to a question as to whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they had indeed discussed the issue, and stressed that his reply had not given a time frame for Ukraine ' s accession to NATO.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance had a duty to meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, RT wrote.
In Crimea, they offered the Green alternative to the NATO course
The President of Ukraine, Wladimir of Zelenski, should pursue good-neighbourly relations with Russia instead of joining NATO.
This was reported on Friday, 27 September, by the Co-President of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Čegrinets.
"The president of Ukraine does not need to repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but rather to heed the advice of [the president of the United States] Donald Trump, who he listened to with a sour face, and to establish a relationship with the president of Russia," said the Chegrin to the journalist "RIA News."
The Chegrin noted that Zelenski is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian President would be able to remain in power only if relations with the Russian Federation were established.
Earlier on 27 September, the NATO Gens Jens Stoltenberg reported that he had had a conversation with Zelenski on the country's accession to the alliance.
To that end, he said, Ukraine had a duty to meet certain conditions.
On 5 June, the deputy was pleased to say to Yevgeny Balicki that the possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance did not guarantee a better life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
"Barcelona" is blackmailing Neimar.
The Spanish "Barcelona" and its former Brazilian footballer, Neimar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that erupted after the attacker's transfer to the French "Pary St. Germain".
The case was about to come to trial, but the Catalans offered the player to settle the dispute without the intervention of the Femid.
Otherwise, they refuse him to return.
Neumar and his smart father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, had an interesting focus: by agreement with the Barza, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million Euros.
However, just a year later, the forward was in the SGW for the record 222 million euro.
Still, he's got 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the rest of the 18.
In addition, the Brazilian jurists insist that the club owes him interest on the late payment.
When Neimar's claims were reported in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The Blue Granate insists that the bonus was based on the full contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considered that the player had only a quarter of the 40 million euro and required the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in summer, Neimar and Barsa almost agreed to return the "foolish" player to the elbow of Catalonia.
True, the deal has failed, but the hope for a forward shift remains.
And so, according to Sports.Ru, citing the insiders, the club's lawyers told the players that if the issue of financial claims was not resolved in pre-trial proceedings, it would rule out the possibility of the return of the Brazilian.
Naymar himself is so eager to return that he has asked for assurances that the Catalans will buy it back.

Media representatives visited the fourth power plant of the BSEC
A video of the station's fourth power station at the Chernobyl power plant was released online, and was the first to be published on YouTube by the Ruptly Video Agency.
It is noted that a group of 15 members of the media had access to the fourth BSEC Reactor Management Hall as part of the presentation of the guide on the exclusion zone.

Also in the area of exclusion, the filming ban is lifted.
In the past, it was reported that the Exclusion Zone of the BSEC from the Belarus side had been opened for tourists.
The tour organisers stressed that there is less radiation in the area than in the air in a day.

Which club will take Pavel Mamaev's paroleed
A football player named Pavel Mamaev, released last week from parole, will not return to the club "Crasnodar."
The former quarterback of this club is in a position to sign a contract with the FC Rostov, reports the Championate Portal.
According to the publication, the talks between Rostova and Mamaeva are now in the final stage.
A contract with a 31-year-old footballer is expected to be signed for two years, with the possibility of an extension for another season.
"Sport Express" writes that the day before, Pavel Mamaev was to undergo a medical check-up at the Moscow Dinamo, but the check was not made due to the "undefined situation at the club."
The Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamaev last week by agreement of the parties.
He has been playing for the Red-Dar Club since 2014.
With the team, he won the bronze of Russia's championship twice.
In the past, Momev was in favour of the Moscow "Torpedo" and the CSKA.
From 2009 to 2016, Momev played for the Russian team, holding 15 games.
He served his sentence for fighting in the centre of Moscow last October, along with Xenita's player Alexander Cocorin Mamaev.
In mid-September, they were released from parole.
Zenit signed a new contract with Cocorin.
A man with a samurai sword tried to resist a cart found in a dumpster.
A resident of the U.S. city of Auckland Park, Florida, is under arrest for attempted murder after he hit a samurai sword on his opponent in a dispute over a cart found in the trash.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging in a pile of trash near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, who had been out for an evening walk.
The last one decided to join the search and found a black cart among the trash.
Miller saw Beavers' find, and he was upset.
He thought he could claim the cart because he was the first to dig in the trash.
The men started to argue.
Suddenly Bivers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his home.
Then Miller took the same samurai sword he had found in the same pile and started stalking the opponent.
He got Bivers near his house.
Miller pulled the sword out of the knife and started swinging it in the direction of the cart's kidnapper.
Beavers told Miller that what's going on is on video.
When Miller spotted the video camera, he escaped, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went in the house.
Shortly afterward, he saw a woman come in his yard and pick up the cart, yelling at him.
The police have already been looking for Miller for driving an unlicensed car.
The man was arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the U.S. city of Hardiston, New Jersey, the hedge fund manager had attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.
He thus responded that the guests at the wedding, which had been celebrated at the same hotel where he was staying, had not given him a light.
Massive riots for three
The "Moscow case" against the participants in the summer protest, the more noticeable it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more it is, the more, the more it is, the more it is, the more, the more it is, the more, the more it is, the more, the more it is, the more.
Evidence of the very fact of the “mass disturbances” does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to bring the case to a standstill, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the drop of the charges.
The breakup of the case should inspire the community, but it is certain that it will leave in extreme anger the stewards, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have been in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining in the case under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disturbances), Alexei Minyalo, was suddenly released without any obligation, and after a few hours and completely rehabilitated, the CBR dropped the charges.
Minylo had been under arrest for almost two months, and had been promoted by several professional communities: historians, priests, and literators.
The case then left only two accused of involvement in the riots (initially 13): Sergey Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samarimiddin Rajabov, whom the court had extended his arrest the previous day until the end of December (he is also charged with the use of violence against a representative of power, art. 318 PC).

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to punish police officers for insulting them online.
The Russian Ministry of the Interior has prepared amendments to the Police Act to protect the security guards from the dissemination of slanderous and dishonoring information on the Internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill was made on the federal legal instrument portal, and the draft document itself had not yet been published.
The Explanatory Note to the paper states that it is being developed in relation to the need to protect the honour and dignity of a police officer from “sharing in information and communication networks, including on the Internet”, defamatory information, including discrediting information.
The exact way in which police officers are to be protected from libel on the Internet is not specified.
In this connection, it is stated in the explanation of the document that the provisions of the amendments will be applied “by the individualization of the mechanism” by the Act on the blocking of posts that offend the authorities and the Act on fines for such posts.
Both laws entered into force in March this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public debate and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the Police Act are to enter into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Wladimir Putin signed a law to punish “expressly contempt of the State” on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor alerts the resource to a violation and gives it 24 hours to deal with it.
A fine of between 30 and 300,000 roubles for the first violation of the prohibitions, and administrative arrest for the second offence for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslav edition 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Novgorod District Court fined the local resident 30,000 roubles for posting on the network “two records of indecent information that offends human dignity and public morals and manifests a clear disrespect for society, the State, the authorities exercising public authority in the Russian Federation”.

The programme provides for “the provision of affordable housing for middle-income families, including the creation of opportunities to buy (the construction of them with a mortgage at a rate of less than 8 per cent)”.
Earlier in September, it was reported that one of the major players in the Russian mortgage market, Sberbank, was planning to carry out a further reduction in housing interest rates by the end of 2019.
Can phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens extend their youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is not well understood.
One of the most famous is pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (those are cardiovascular, some cancers).
The known sources of phytoestrogen are all beans (the most popular soy), hops, and leenseeds.
Many experts believe, however, that such ADDs cannot be a full - time substitute for natural hormones.
Possible harm from such additives cannot be excluded.
For example, the production of their own hormones can be reduced by the fact that there are too many external analogues in the body.
Vertennikov was called upon to resurrect the Kazakh Jenis.
A former Russian attacker, Rothor, and the Russian team, Oleg Vertennikov, joined the action to revive the Kazakh "Geniz".
The club from Astana, which was known for different years as Dinamo, Cologne, Astana, and Genice, was disbanded in 2014.

"He found out about the Jenice football club's activism organized by his fans.
I couldn't stay out of it!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
It was not the best time in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans, who have always been with the team!
The Munitepasov Stadium, where I scored my 200th ball in my career, will be remembered forever!
"Jenis" has to be reborn!
He's got a huge story and great fans.
I wish them all the best, and I believe that the city's authorities will return to them their home club!' wrote Vertennikov at Instagram.

The hydromethod center called the right people's mark
In Russia, there are a lot of people who try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The hydromethod center checked all the signs that were supposed to work.
Meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can be truly trusted, indeed, in the short term.
As Russian Hydromet Centre's scientific head Roman Wilfund has said, if the sun is red during the setting, the next day will indeed be a good day, as our ancestors have marked.
And if the sky shines white, it will rain the next day.
The second working sign is based on bird surveillance.
It's more common to talk about swabs, if they fly low, it's usually in the rain.
It's simple to say that when the air is soaked, the moths are wetting their wings, and the feathers are forced to drop to hunt insects, as the TASS writes.

Unidentified oil spots were found on the beaches of north-east Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in northeast Brazil.
The areas of pollution have been scattered over 2,000 kilometers of the coastline.
Reports of the first oil slicks discovered began on 2 September.
However, their number continued to grow from day to day until Thursday, as did territorial coverage.
The Brazilian Institute for the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the identified samples.
It turns out they're all identical, and it's about raw oil.
In the State Oil Corporation, Petrobras, which had been sent to analyse the samples found, stated that they did not correspond to the oil extracted from the fields in Brazil.
"It's dense oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks have been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it hit the ocean current," told the Brazilian news portal G1, the coordinator of the Union of Oil Workers of the States of Pernambuco and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches, four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles full of oil film.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment, together with Petrobras, will start cleaning the polluted beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute advises tourists and locals to bypass the oil stains and report all the spots found.
Medvedev commissioned a revision of the standards of the general service
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev commissioned Rostresnadzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Prompromprogue, together with the business and business community, to review the health and epidemiological rules and standards for the commons.
They will also have to consider a shift to the requirements of the Eurasian Economic Union for the management of food.
The agency's proposals are to be submitted to the Government by 15 October at the latest, as stated in the list of letters issued by Mr. Medvedev on 11 September's "Dialogue" programme on "Russia 24".

The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economics is responsible for submitting a bill to the Government by 11 November, as amended by the COAP, on the application of the administrative suspension for the violation of the requirements for the provision of food, which has caused harm to health.
In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Economics, Rosseslavnadzor and the Ministry of Finance need to consider gradually moving from 2021 to a consumer basket, based on a basic set of products that can produce a full diet of healthy diet.
Let's remind you, the business community has been talking about obsolete requirements since the shutdown of one café from the Anderzon network.
The business community called for the lifting of the existing Sang-Pinus, and Rospiznadzor announced the joint development of new ones.
Thirty-three departments are on the list.
In the meantime, Rosexplaznadzor intends to cut the number of health standards and regulations by 40 times by 2021.
At present, the operatives are in possession of information on the three thefts in which the detainee is involved.
A man was employed in the Tula district of Skuratov.
He's been stealing accumulators and car magnets from cars.
Of the two vehicles, BAZ-2106 and BAZ-2107, the kidnapper took the batteries, allegedly for further sale.
"And from another VAZ 2107 car for the same purpose, the intruder took the auto and the sabwoofer," reported to the U.S.A.A. in the Tuly oblast.
The perverted intruder probably intended to resell.
A 26-year-old unemployed person is currently in detention.
Russians have nothing to save - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Valentine's Federation Council, Matvienko, is of the view that the Russians do not have sufficient savings to make the draft law on the guaranteed pension product fully operational in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions from personal savings is common in the world.
It's another matter, how timely we have it.
“In my view, a significant proportion of the population now has incomes, from which they simply have nothing to pay for an increase in pensions in the future,” said V. Matvienko.
The Russians, in the view of the Speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and calculation of the pension, as “the constant changes in this field have completely confused them”.
This does not mean that I am opposed to the improvement of the pension system that governs its legislation.
“Russia is a social State, and we have to do everything we can to make sure that pensions and social security for citizens are improved.
But the steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account national realities,” said V. Matvienko, “RIA News.”
The head of the FS stressed that if the initiative (the draft law on the guarantee of a pension product) was to be developed, several basic principles, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and State responsibility for the security of pension savings, must be established.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that a draft law on the guaranteed pension product (GPP) would be sent for negotiation.
Among the main elements of the scheme are the purely voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, the guarantee of the security of long-term pension savings of citizens by the State, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.

This was revealed by Sony's press release, which states that the third part of Spider-Man with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures had not been able to reach a consensus on the sharing of income, so Spider-Man would leave Marvel.
Sony owns the movie hero's rights.
She leased them for Marvel's films, which belongs to Disney.

At some point, it was reported that Disney was not allowed to do so, and the company wanted to renegotiate the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Faigi said he was thrilled.
It's amazing that Spidey's trip to the colonized Marvel will continue.
"We all at Marvel Studios are very happy to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a figure.
It is a hero whose history touches all generations and audiences all over the world,” says his press release.
At the same time, Faigi recalled that Sony was also creating his own colonized, built around Spider-Man.
"So it happened that he was the only super-powered hero in a different place.
So as Sony continues to develop his own Spidey universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he noted.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account an excerpt from "The Wall Street Wolf," in which Leonardo de Caprio's hero screams, "I'm not leaving!"
In August, there was information on conflicts between companies.
According to the media, Disney wanted to get half the cash from the Spider-Man films, on the condition that both companies would pay half the cost of painting.
But it didn't work out for Sony.
The news of the possible departure of a loved superhero from the mazeled Marvel has angered many loyal fans.
The details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but said, "We have been very cooperative for the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many fans [Spaceman].
We're glad we can go forward together."
The film "Avengers: Final", which united Spider-Man, Torah, Hulk, and other superheroes in Marvel, was the most cashier in the history of the world's film, putting the Avatar first.

A report about this was made available on the database's official website.

We need to learn from SCO and BRICS, including Russia, a visitor from New Delhi.
- In our confederation, 9,000 direct members and 300,000 partner companies from 130 countries.
All of this is a small and medium-sized business that works with the countries of the Shanghai Organization.
And we are not standing on the ground, but we are developing, and all of these sanctions against Russia and the geo-political situation in general are helping us all to grow.
Our bilateral trade is now more than $10 billion, but it can be doubled.
First of all, through new technologies in the areas of health, artificial intelligence and robotics.
Our trade is not just tanks and heavy industry.
According to Manish Kumar, India has already established the first contacts with modern Russian centers.
For example, a delegation from New Delhi and other cities had recently visited Skolkovo and Innopolis.
We have signed a memorandum to create systems in which we can build our modern business.
Because entrepreneurship is not a whim, it's a necessity.
We need a step towards economic well-being.
We need to expand, attract small and medium-sized business, and, together with Russia, China, and other countries, we will certainly do so, emphasized by the Indian industrialist.

At the Congress, Trump and Zelenski had a "Russian trail" conversation.
In the lower house of the United States Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of having been involved in the scandal caused by the telephone conversation between the head of the White House, Donald Trump, and the Ukrainian president, Vladimir Zelenski.
The assumption that the "Russians" might somehow be behind this story was put forward by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, to MSNBC News.
“Russia, I believe, has attached a hand to this,” said the Democrat, but did not make any further comments.
The Pelosian-led Democrats, who are holding the majority in the House, have earlier announced an impeachment procedure against the President.
This happened after a CSI complained to Trump about it.
The informer suspected that Trump had put pressure on his interlocutor in a conversation with Zelenski in July to bring a case against the son of former Vice-President Joseph Biden, the latter of which might become a Trump contestant in the elections a year later.
The White House had to give congressmen and the public a transcript of a scandalous conversation.

The expert explained why we should drop the tea in the packets.
A team of Canadian scientists from the University of McGill found that in five minutes more than 10 billion microplastic particles are released in a cup of tea.
An expert in food security, Elizabeth Thinov, said, can also add sawdust particles to the packaged drink.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain accurate information on the composition of the packaged tea - the producer can add ingredients that will not be shown on the package.
The sawdusts don't get thrown out at the end of the season, so they might end up in tea.
"More than that, the packets don't always include tea plants," said Tikhonov.
She said that it was best not to use such a cup of tea for the spike, which was sold in special stores.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of packaged tea was not only in the composition but also in the method of producing it - microparticles heat up to high temperatures, so that they might begin to release harmful substances.
"The best way to buy pure green or black tea is to have the least extra in this drink," the expert said.

Regionals were invited to share the secrets of business support
On 27 September, the Chairman of the Federation Economic Policy Council Committee, Andrei Kutepov, wrote to the Minister for Economic Development, Maxim Oreshkin, and to the Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, to express his position on the initiatives of the constituents of the Federation to improve the legislation on support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Time to build cross-regional links
The Council of the Federation Economic Policy Committee summarized information from the regions on their business development and legalization programmes for self-employed persons, as well as on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions briefed the senators on the problems of the development of SMEs and put forward proposals for the improvement of existing legislation.
“To date, there is a lack of regional communication, which has led the business community in all the regions to visit senators to indicate the lack of information on regional business development programmes in the country as a whole,” said Andrey Kutepov.
In an annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive regional developments in the legalization of self-employment and a summary of the proposals and issues from the regions (available in the revision).
In addition to the relevant ministries, the combined data from the regions have also been sent to the heads of the regional executive branch.
The exchange of information on successful developments in the regions could trigger the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step in such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” said the "Parliamentary Gazette" by the senator.
Useful experience
Today, small- and medium-sized business support programmes have been and are being successfully implemented in many regions of the country.
For example, the Entrepreneurship Support Centre is operating in the Volgodsk oblast, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In Ivanov oblast, a business support system has been developed to implement the single window principle through multifunctional centres.
In Krasnodar province, new agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the country budget.
The Orlovsk region has a cluster development centre.
The Amor Region of the federal project “Acceleration of Small and Medium-Size Entrepreneurs” provides for the possibility of subsidies to business incubators based on active non-State cohorts from the federal budget.
A number of other regions have special support measures for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be taken out of the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of legislative changes should be made in order to better support small and medium-sized business.
For example, the archangelic region proposed that the term “self-employment” should be replaced by “business” because it “is most consistent with the content of the public service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In Ivanovsk oblast, it is considered necessary to introduce amendments to expand the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for the repair and repair of accommodations, day-to-day buildings and physical training.
The Brian region considers it important to strengthen the control of malpractice dairy producers through the Mercury Veterinary System.
And in the Kostrm and Magadan oblasts, the concept of social entrepreneurship and support for social entrepreneurship is advocated in the legal and regulatory field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of public support programmes for small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of public support programmes for small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills,” assured Andrew Kutepov.
Airlines Helped Passengers Avoid Neighboring Crying Children
Japan Airlines (JAL) launched a new function: when booking spaces on the plane, you can find out where the small children will sit.
Now, if you want to live with them, you can avoid them.
The Japanese airline Japan Airlines (JAL) had the opportunity to use the new option to avoid wanting to live with small children.
The air carrier has started a function that can track where the children will be seated.
In the course of booking, passengers will be able to see a picture of the child's head in the field, which is occupied by children between eight days and two years of age.
Thus, those who do not want to fly next to the babies because of the possible inconvenience of their weeping can get as far away from them as possible.
The Internet users who use the services of the airline were thrilled by the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the users complained that he had flown from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and he had three cries next door.
Another commentator suggested the introduction of “adult-only flights”, expressing his willingness to pay for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that they would now try to always choose to move Japan Airlines because they see no pleasure in flying next to a criesy child in a closed space.
Previously, a woman traveling with a baby had tried to comfort her travelers on the Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She cooked a bag of candy for each of the 200 passengers, each containing an apology note.

On the walls of the wagons you can see rare archival images and films.

"Supports" to Russia have fallen 100 times.
In the Government of the Russian Federation, it was estimated that the supply of agricultural and food products to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo had decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Poetin, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019, compared to 3,442,200 tons in the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.
However, the value of imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4,975.5 million, respectively.
This is the supply of goods that have not been subject to the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the volume of prohibited imports was offset by an increase in imports from the CIS, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Let us recall that at the end of August the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are not allowed to enter Russia by means of counter-sanctions.
The document on the official legal information portal noted that the rules had been extended for a further year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Originally, the destruction order applied to products from the US, EU, Australia, Norway, and Canada.
Later, on 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Ukraine joined the list on 1 January 2016.
Putin's decree on the destruction of illegal “sanctions” (products that fell under the food embargo that Moscow had imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.
The Government, in turn, has allowed the destruction of “sanctionary” food in any legal way.
As the Western sanctions continued, the Russian Federation also extended its response.
This measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The ban does not concern the import of goods for personal consumption of up to 5 kg.
However, the head of the Council of the President of the Russian Federation for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, had earlier referred to the “simplely immoral” destruction of food, which he said had a negative impact on the upbringing of people.
In addition, Rospresnadzor launched an initiative to ban the destruction of foods suitable for consumption in early June.
A similar recommendation was then made to the Government by the Human Rights Council of the President of the Russian Federation.
And the vice-premier of the Russian Federation, Alexei Gordeyev, said that it was wrong to destroy food, and we need to think about how to use it for the sake of quality.

Chile started constructing a 1 billion euro telescope
This is reported by TASS with a reference to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
According to ESO, this week the construction of a dome of the E-ELT (European Extreme Large Telescope) was officially started, so far the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.
The total cost is estimated by the EURO to be over a billion Euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the construction of equipment and the building of the observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is the record large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments of 1.4 meters.
This is a huge mirror, as well as two support surface reflectors of a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, that will help E-ELT to get the first detailed images of planets outside the solar system, of stars in other galaxies, as well as search for Earth's doppelgangers.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Although the dome has just begun to be built, the mirrors, scientific tools, and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers, and others for three years since the first E-ELT plans were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, the total value of which was about 400 million euros, was awarded by the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
