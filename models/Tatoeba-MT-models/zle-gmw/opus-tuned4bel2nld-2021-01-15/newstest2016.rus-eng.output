The social map of the Ivanov Region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the maintenance of the public passenger transport allowance.
Since 24 September, there has been a change in the procedure for the organization of favourable travel by citizens using the social map of the Ivanov region.
According to the press service, the Government of Russia in Ivanov oblast reports that the changes provide for the maintenance of the right to travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of social map calculations into line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia “On the national payment system”.
At the same time, the social map of the Ivanov region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application have changed.
For example, the replenishment limit is no longer set for travel as it was before, but for money, with winter and summer periods of not more than 400 roubles in the winter, and not more than 800 roubles in the summer period for the current month.
Now, social card holders on transport receipts will have to track the cash balance rather than the number of remaining trips.
The cost of favourable travel for citizens would be 1/2 times the rate in effect for the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed for the regional budget.
The schedule for the replenishment of the social map remains the same, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new mode of travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed account of the expenditure of money on the social map to the point where it is accurate.
In addition, there is the possibility of recovering the sums of uncollected but unexpended money.
In addition, the scheme of payments with the carriers is becoming transparent, as now half of the cost of the journey is paid by the national, and the same amount pays the carrier the budget.
There will be no commission to charge money on the map.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Ivanov Road and Transport Department, reported that more than 33 million social map trips had been made in the region in 2014 and almost 25 million in 2015.
In the regional budget, more than 470 million roubles are provided for the provision of favourable travel of citizens using the social map.
As at 1 September, the reimbursement for this purpose amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
At the time of the 911 call, the professor confessed to the murder of a friend.
At the time of the 911 call, the professor at the University of Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that he needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there was a dog in the house, who was alive, but probably upset, and said that the family of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note that was negligently written on a white sheet of linted paper: "I'm sorry, I'd like to get it all back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the note says, in the words of the authorities signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who had held two online courses at the University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to travel 300 miles to a university campus, where the police thought he had shot all the respected professor of history, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
The Chief of Police at the University of Delta, Lynn Baford, reported that the University had learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb had made that real call to 911 shortly after.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced the students and teachers to hide behind the locked doors, the authorities still tried to add to one picture the motive behind Lamba.
The information shared by investigators in both parts of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew him, helped to draw up a picture of a talented but possibly concerned teacher.
The students said that they were looking forward to his classes.
The police in Gauthia, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he expressed his appreciation to the “precious people” he had encountered in his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended both.
At the same time, there were some preconditions for problems.
A student who spoke well about Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him at the end of the school year 2014-15 about how he was struggling with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the University of Delta to grant him sick leave, saying that he had some health problems.
This year he only taught two online classes.
Recent changes in university rules for admission to work meant that the doctor's degree, which Lamb had worked so hard to obtain, would not guarantee him the automatic recruitment of a teacher.
The president of the University, William Laforge, said that he had no knowledge of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "apparently, Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
The police attacked Lamb's trail after his escape from campus when he was on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber detonator gun in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents' home in Greenville, Mississippi, reported by the coroner of Washington Metel Johnson County.
His engine-powered car was still on the driveway.
It was not clear why Lamb had come to the house, even though, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people who lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogical science.
He won a PhD in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and fun man.
Carla Harston told me that she was 15 years old and that Lambu was 20 years old when they met through common friends.
She and her friends went to high school, and he was a cool older guy who for years tried to teach her how to play a guitar.
In those years, he had been a success for women.
All the girls melted when he was around," says Harston, who is now 40 and lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss must have met for a while by the time of the event.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gauthia in a brick house, the back of which went to the canal.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends, and that they had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," said O'Stin about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and was playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin told me that his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, the bartender and, on a part-time basis, the facilitator of entertainment programs at the gloomy lit bar The Juliet Room in Gothier's suburbs, said that he had last seen Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and lip harmonics for a small number of visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and joked about each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a dead professor, held freshmen's seminars and specialized in the history of native Americans and colonial America, told Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student self-government.
At the University of Delta University campus in Cleveland, on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students, and community members, participated in a memorial candle-lighting ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang the Bright Morning Star and the Amazing Grace.
The classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
The crisis is over.
It's a day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped to produce the Assocated Press by Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in response to a statement by the police that Lamb's call to the 911 service after the murder of Schmidt, and that even though Lamb had referred to his wife as his wife when he called 911, the information that they had been married had not been confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire less staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that he will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as he did last year, and the toy and toy reteller for children claims that he will give regular and temporary staff more hours to work.
The company states that it is planning to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 that were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would start interviewing the applicants this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although it is only a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to have enough staff in the shops and to sell, ship and deliver the goods.
Michael J. Fox is kidding about "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Rear to the Future" was a huge event for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons, too.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and it hit me - the Princess Diana will be next to me," he said in the trailer by the soon-to-be-screen documentary "Rear in Time."
The movie is starting, and I think I'm literally at a distance of my arm and in a fake tree from dating the Princess of Wales.
"Rear in time" - a documentary on the film "Rear to the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the director Robert Zemekis, and the executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The film premiered 30 years ago.
"For me, "Silberg says, "it is, of course, the greatest time travel movie ever made."
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD, and some cinemas in October.
UN Head states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in response to Russia's military support for Syria, states that there is no “war solution” for a nearly five-year conflict, and the increase in weapons will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the United Nations again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council — the US, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had “made the situation insurmountable”.
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had shown in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 polls that show that Donald Trump is not kidding
Some tried to label him a provocateur.
Others shunned him as a joke.
And some of them call for a scandal.
But no matter how many Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high profile in the polls, they have failed (to date).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's advantage in double digits, and some are starting to ask seriously what this means to a real estate magnate in terms of the chances of being nominated.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican Party.
The experts point out that at that time, in 2011, Rick Perry gave up his popularity to Herman Kane, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there's a lot of reasons why he'd fight in the general election.
But external groups, such as the "Political Activism Super-Committee" of Jeb Bush, and the economic conservative group "Growth Club" recognize the unrelenting power of Trump and begin to get their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some of the polls that indicate that a real estate magnet is not just an intermediate phase:
Trump's sympathy ratings are 180 degrees wide.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University revealed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of this property magnate.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And all of these are at the top of the initial stage.
A quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of the Republicans there are positive with Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would have Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said that they either reacted with “joy” or with “satisfaction” if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "disturbed" if he'd become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they'd be "excited" against 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
Next to the level of joy?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republicans say that they will be "unsatisfied" or "unsatisfied" if Jeb W. Bush's apprentice becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of the voters who are prone to the Republicans all over the country believe that the Magnatus is at the right time to be president, as the ABC News/Washington Post poll of Monday showed.
The same figure appears at the country's first closed assembly in the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the same person who might be in charge, according to Queenipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he's not the person who can be effective in the post, and almost six of the 10 independents say that his temperament is not appropriate for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to that idea.
When they wear their expert hats, the Republican voters think Trump is serious.
On the question of who is the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of ten said Trump was the favorite, according to CNN/ORC last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of ten bets on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: the GOP voters had never had the right magic crystal.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that a large number of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign to be persuasive.
Even if the Republicans had united around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that this dispersion is likely to have the advantage of Trump, while those who do not support the Trump are evenly distributed among the supporters of more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical one-to-one competition between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump is almost always supported by the majority.
It is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiona, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points ahead, and finally Rand Paul, John Cash, and Chris Christie 33 points ahead.
He's got a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's around him?
Ben Carson overcame the businessman for a total of 19 points in the hypothetical one-to-one competition.
A little over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the voters who support Trump say they're sure of their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they keep the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense rivalry at the moment is with an outsourced colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who say they've changed their mind are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rape” two months ago in his campaign opening speech, the topic of immigration became the most relevant in conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s sham is to divert key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican Party and to prevent rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post poll on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration attracts attention, Donald Trump seems to remain in the same position.
The government's disillusionment is gaining new ground.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now rely on the support of about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their outside status.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post poll say that they want a political outsider rather than a man with experience in government.
And they're also offended by Washington.
A survey of Des Moins Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are dissatisfied with the activities of the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 per cent “unsatisfied” and 21 per cent “unsatisfied”.
The government will decide on the status of pension indexes in October.
The vice-premier of the Russian Federation, Olga Holodetz, said that the government was currently looking for options to implement the 2016 law on indexing pensions to the real rate of inflation.
It noted that a solution was to be found by 8 October, by the time the next year's draft budget was submitted to the Government.
In addition, the cabin discusses the option of extending the decision to freeze the accumulated pension to Russians.
The hungry noted that the sum of pension savings is 350 billion roubles.
About the same amount as the indexing of pensions in full for the following year.
According to the vice-premier, there is no final decision as to who should pay the contributions for the non-working citizens.
The hungry is of the view that if a person is not working on his or her own initiative and does not belong to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that a society pays for him or her.
In the past, the media have reported that the Kabmin is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are the eyelids often irritated and red?
The optalmologist Tatiana Levashov responds:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from a lot of small particles that settle on them.
By forgetting to clean up a regular age, we often contribute to the development of the bloom.
Quit simple:
Do not trim your eyes with your filthy hands, wear a special wet napkin for the eyelid;
at least 1-2 times a day, clean up the edges of the day from the harmful substances stored in them.
Cleaning procedures should be supplemented with warm compresses with herbs (salvey, chamomile) that soften the dense secret of the salivary glands, and then massage the edges of the century, which should be carried out by round motions of the fingers;
Do not use alcohol when washing your make-up.
It dries and dehydrates the skin and contributes to the more dense secret of the salivary glands.
Pyongyang claims that the Korean nuclear men have created a nuclear warhead.
The North Korean authorities have reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the Yongben nuclear complex, is operating “at full capacity”.
A report of this was made available on the website of the National Central Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is ready at any time to respond to the “U.S. aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “by quantity and quality”.
The last nuclear test was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, no plans have been made to resume the full operation of the reactor since then.
Pyongyang claims that he managed to create a nuclear warhead.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has also tested medium- and short-range missiles on numerous occasions, writing politic.ru.
Zhirinovski demanded that the reference to brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
The leader of the LDPR, Vladimir Zhirinowski, believes that the reference to the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He announced this during the State Duma meeting, and reported to the Russian News Service.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and killers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even the athletes can't stand," said Girinovsky.
The MP believes that all four-point members, which contains this line, should be removed:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinowski stated that the current anthem should be changed to "God save the King" and that the Russian tricolour should be replaced by the Imperial flag, writing politic.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe is to deal with the problem of refugees, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans care about the fate of the refugees, let them stop supporting the terrorists.
That is our view of the problem.
"This is the core of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, they will not be possible as long as people die, as long as the bloodshed continues, and as long as the people do not feel completely secure.
“So we can reach consensus, but we can't do anything until we win terrorism in Syria,” stressed Al-Assad.
Let us recall that some 500,000 migrants, including those from Syria, have arrived in the European Union during this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world had been the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that thousands of militants of the extremist group “Islamic State” may be among the migrants who come to Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The people of the German city had set up a holiday for the refugees.
Over the past month, Germany had become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it had recently strengthened border controls to keep them from flooding.
The authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of the year, although some experts refer to significant numbers.
More than 90,000 refugees have already arrived since the beginning of September.
A BBC correspondent, Jenny Hill, visited Darmstadt, whose residents offer a very warm welcome to migrants.
Jeremy Corbin debuts at the Prime Minister's question session.
After the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut at the question-and-answer session is expected to the Prime Minister very much
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon speak for the first time at the Prime Minister's question-and-answer session with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six issues in the afternoon; the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party are likely to follow him closely.
He made a call for “lower theater and more facts” at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some of the meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as head; it will take place after his appointment of a shadow office and his speech at the annual Tread Union Congress on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the leader of the laborers to stand silent during the national anthem on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the British Battle, led to criticism by a number of conservative members of Parliament, and became the subject of a number of front-line articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
The Spokesman, Mr. Corbin, stated that he had “stayed in respectful silence” and recognized “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain”.
However, Mr. Corbin's shadow office member Owen Smith told Newsnight at BBC 2 that he would advise the lead of laborers to sing the national anthem “indistinctly” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbin's team, expressing differences on economic, defence and international policy, while less than one-sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant said that political discord would also “couple” the Labour Party after Mr. Corbin had been appointed to the European Union and the Government's restrictions on compensation.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Treadunion Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at eliminating the very idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that the party had a “full clarity” that it had been in opposition only to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the laborists to meet David Cameron at the "courier's box" in the last 10 years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who had promised a different approach to politics, stated that he had “involved collective resources” to get Mr. Cameron's ideas and had received more than 30,000 offers.
A member of Parliament from the Islandington North district said that the Prime Minister's questions caused an excess of confrontation, and that he would also refrain from the witty answers and the exchange of thorns, instead promising to focus on serious issues, such as poverty, inequality and the problems faced by young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Economy in the shadow office, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was not present - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also expressed the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor if possible, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercoe, to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to move away from the political style of the “marriage balagan,” often associated with the procedure, to the Prime Minister, but he acknowledged a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to run the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires major reforms.
"Shopping in Yoburg" Homeless Young People Learned From Photographs

Pound sterling increases as wages rise in the United Kingdom
The pound grew against the background of the increase in British wages, with the FTSE 100 index rising as a result of the SABMiller purchase offer.
From May to June, British earnings, less bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent over the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the highest since 2009 and was welcomed as an earlier rescheduling of forecasts for possible increases in citations.
The pound sterling rose by more than 1% in relation to the dollar to $1.505, and by 0.84% in relation to the euro, to a figure of 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6,229,21 by 1.49%.
Against the background, SABMiller shares rose by 20 per cent as a result of the purchase offer made by the competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the two largest brewery companies in the world, assembling brands like Budweiser, Stella Artoys, Peroni, and Grollsch.
Burbery's shares grew by 0.9%, with encouraging news from a rival group of suite-grade producers, Richemont.
Recent sales data on Richemont have outperformed all expectations and have shown that sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - have begun to grow again.
Glencore stock grew by 5% after a mining giant announced that it had been able to raise $2.5 billion in shares as part of a debt-reducing strategy.
The mondi's stock of paper and packaging was the leader of the drop in the index by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell".
JD Sports' shares rose after the sporting apparel company reported an 83% increase in pre-tax profits to £46.6 million in six months.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages can hinder expansion
The executive director of JD Sports, Peter Cougil, says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in the cost of work, he says.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to combat Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up food provider launched a campaign to protect the market share of the IGA Ritters in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming injection by Aldi of $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two bulk warehouses and the first of the 120 stores in South and West Australia early next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relations with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and at events like "Adelaide Show".
Retailers and IGA suppliers, such as the producer of Simmo's ice cream from Dunsboro, who offers a taste in IGA stores, and shopkeepers who sell tickets for South Australia's football league games with a discount on permanent clients.
Metcash is expected to provide more details of its protection strategy on 29 September, the day that this bulk supplier of food, alcohol and household goods will be spending its annual investor strategy day.
In South Australia and Western Australia, IGA stores account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show a higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known to be protagonists, so the market is more favorable for IGA retailers than in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland - over 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA, compared to about 14 per cent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will take 5 per cent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of the opening of their first shops, taking out the market from all the players present, but mostly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst of Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA Ritters may lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The prognosis is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA and 30 in WA next year, making sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
Loss of income and sales of food at high constant cost Metcash may cost the company about 13 million income before paying interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat believes.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal customers.
In Morgan Stanley, it is estimated that Metcash food sales will drop by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017, and 2.1 per cent in 2018, lowering the company's market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglas's senior stock manager, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, noticed at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "could be very likely to disappear in a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the board of directors of Metcash had contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA in the market fell from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and Metcash's income from the food business, which the company provides to some 1,200 IGA Ritters, fell by 43 per cent over 2012 as a result of the operational deconversion and the pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million a year to equalize retail prices with those of Coles and Woolworths for a thousand items per week, and helping IGA Ritellers to remodel outlets, as well as offering a fast-growing range of fresh foods and a wider selection of branded foods.
Metcash Director-General Ian Morris said that the price-equivalent and reshaping of trade space was gaining momentum, and he hoped that the company would achieve an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanashi Kokkinakis is supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves credit, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanashi Kokkinakis has been indirectly affected by the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more credit than critics, as President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy, says.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duo and often called "Special Ks", was involuntarily the focus of attention due to the shameful rivalry between Kiryos and Stan Wavrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after, during the hot Cincinnati qualifying match, the judge at the tower had to split Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "The Vaurinca was to put on Kiryos' spades, and I was to put on this guy's spades."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after the cramp in his leg saved Richard Gasque from a possible defeat on US Open, Healy is loyally defending Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomic in the single-class semi-final Davis Cup against the United Kingdom.
"I'm very worried about one thing, namely, that Tanashi got involved in a conflict," said Healy.
He really broke the racket when his leg was cramped on US Open, but he's not the first player to break the racket when hopes fell, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at himself in a rather provocative US situation, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he's a trustworthy man.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he's working hard, he's got a great fit for the team, he's never had a problem with other players, he's got a lot of respect outside the court, he's in a very good shape, he's a very focused and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match that began on Friday, believing that "mutual consent" was the right way out for everyone, but hoping that the Canberra guy would return to the team as a long-term player.
"Before all, we want the team to focus completely on the match, not the argument around [Kirios]," said Healy.
And I think that Nick has gained power very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray prove, he's growing up in front of the public, he's made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of focus for a while so he can think about them, and that's the best for the team and the best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
By declaring a state of emergency, Hungary had closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and was arresting those who were trying to enter the country illegally in order to contain the flow of migrants.
There had been riots on the border, with hundreds of migrants congregating on the border, on which the Serbian authorities had reacted sharply.
In an uncertain way, people fleeing armed violence in their home country broke down tents and settled on the road between the two countries.
But the discontent was on the rise.
When a police helicopter was roaming over them, the migrants shouted "Open the border" and yelled at the Hungarian Special Police.
Some protested against food and water.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary “unacceptable” when more and more came from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not a collateral damage.
There is a need to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” said Ivica Dačić in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serb border began the day after a bloc of 28 countries was unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to take overall responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that EU member States would receive an additional 120,000 refugees, including those from Hungary.
German chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a European Union emergency summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis affecting the continent.
Hungary, however, did not expect any quick action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more power to deal with the crisis, thus enabling them to block roads and speed up asylum proceedings.
In the meantime, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siyarto, stated that his country was also planning to erect a barbed wire fence on the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it had completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners had been linked to urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “bottom line” and border crossing point for the European Union's settlers, many of whom are refugees, victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban insists that most of the people who come to the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees, victims of wars that are entitled to protection, and this view is very different from that of other EU countries, Germany.
The new laws, which entered Hungary at midnight, now make it an offence to cross or damage a four-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison sentences for human trafficking accused.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government has declared a state of emergency,” said a government spokesman, Zoltan Kovac, in the south of Seged.
We make it clear that it is a crime to cross the border illegally.
Technically, the Parliament is still required to authorize the deployment of the military force, which is expected next week, but the Assocated Press reporters, who are at the border, have been witnessing the presence of armed men with vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Diardi Bacondi, the National Security Adviser to Orban, reported that 45 persons had been caught by the authorized authorities trying to cross the border at the border itself, and 15 had been caught inside the country.
They have crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are charged with administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia, putting a rail wagon overlaid with barbed wire to block one of the passages.
The riots erupted on the main passage across the border near the city of Ryosk, Hungary, as the Hungarians had set up a service space to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds had pressed each other to break in.
Some 20 individuals have been able to penetrate, and thousands of people have remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway from Serbia to Hungary and announced a ban on food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in the national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the Democrats' race for nominating all over the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching her up.
Clinton is currently supported by 47 per cent of the primary Democrats (down from 58 per cent), and Sanders is second to 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to take part in the presidential race, is supported by 15 per cent of the prime Democrats.
More than five months before the start of the competition in the primary elections, most Democrats say that it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate to be supported.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident of their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support for some population groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton is holding a huge advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has declined.
Her support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
Clinton's preference for democratic voters under the age of 50 is gone, and he and Sanders are now equal.
But Clinton still has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton beat Sanders to a double-digit number of liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Almost half of the primary Democrats all over the country say that they would be enthusiastically supportive of Clinton if she had become a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and a further 15 per cent would support it simply because it was a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It may not be surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm for it.
Among those who do not support Clinton at the moment, the views are more divisive - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 percent of the primary Democrats say that they would be enthusiastically supportive of Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked outright why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that it's the time for a woman president (13 percent) and that she's the best candidate (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also speak of an association that links her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It's also called consensus on issues and the chances of being elected.
As the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the prime Democrats would like him to join the race - though a third feels he should not.
When they are asked who they want to be second among party candidates, the prime Democrats are in most cases called Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, over half say that they'd choose Biden second, that's more than Sanders'.
If Biden chooses not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of the Democrats see Clinton as the best chance to win the general elections; however, that figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
In this indicator, Biden is the second-largest one, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in answer to the question, which is most important for a candidate, the Democrats choose other options than the chance of being elected.
Like last month, none of the Democrat or potential candidates is an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democrat candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy, with good leadership.
Biden, of all three, is in the lead in honesty, and Clinton's strength is in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of the primary Democrats do not consider Clinton to be fair and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have any opinion on it.
The prime Democrats also generally view Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as similar.
By all of these standards, about a quarter of the Democrats have no opinion of Sanders.
While questions about Hillary's personal mailbox and the Hillary Clinton server are continuing as her Secretary, most prime Democrats are satisfied with her explanation and feel that this has not adversely affected their general view of it.
But that's a very different story for the American public at large.
Half the Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided as early as March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the debate over e-mail has had no effect on their general view of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their view of it has deteriorated.
They're mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who claim that their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered fair and credible by her party, this continues to be a problem for her as a whole, with only 32 per cent considering it fair and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of the registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be fair and credible.
Clinton and Trump, however, are both getting good levels of leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson, and Bush show the best results in honesty.
Most people see Sanders as an honest man rather than an honest man, but, like Carson, a lot of people don't think about him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democrats is 6 percentage points.
According to the national poll, Ben Carson was close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump in a recent CBS/New York Times poll.
The two candidates won half the poll vote, leaving the rest of them looking for support under their feet.
Voters from all over the country continue to support Trump, whose support rate rose from 23% in a recent CBS poll held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27% in a Tuesday poll.
But Carson took off in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoyed support in all population groups, crowding Trump with a group of Republican voters with a higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio's governor John Kasich, have rolled back with the Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10 percent last month to 2 percent now.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Haqabi, and Florida Senator, Marco Rubio, together ranked third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this recent poll is + or minus 6 per cent, and the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed Carson's growth in the polls, showing support for 19% of the Republicans, behind Trump with 32% of the support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's growing support last week, Trump made a number of critical hits on the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday at the time the campaign was shut down in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the death of a freshman at Baruch College.
About two years after the death of a college student during the rite of fraternity in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"Pi Delta Psi Brothers from the Baruch College of New York brutally attacked Jang "Michael" Deng during the rite of dedication in September 2013 and failed to bring him to the hospital in time for his death," reported the police.
Officials say that a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed a number of times while he was trying to reach his target, walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood didn't call 911 when Deng passed out, and they've been waiting an hour to get him to the hospital, talking to the police.
However, they took the time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, to ask for advice, as the Chief of Police Chris Wagner had said at the press conference.
"At this point, the members of the fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially putting the well-being of the fraternity above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the postmortem report, Deng suffered some blunt trauma to his head, body, and hip.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of the rites of fraternity, as at least one student dies during them every year since 1970,” said Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The fraternities and their members must be held accountable, a step that is very important on the part of the authorities.
The jurors in Monroe County have opted for a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with violence against a rookie and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but, if there is an organization that has formally or informally authorized all of this, so is her,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity excluded the local branch.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in the rate, and the bulls' market will stumble, the bond returns will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take before the attack, and how long it's gonna take.
Specifically, for the economy, history does not explain much about time.
The recession took place just 11 months after the first rate hike and for a total of 86 months.
The hardness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
So the U.S. Central Bank administration is so insistent that investors should not focus on when they start to raise the stakes, but on how long it's gonna take to adapt.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about raising rates is overstated.
"The Federal Reserve's first rate hike, with a global financial crisis coming, will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the money era," said Julian Jessop, a major international economic expert at Capital Economics, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of interest rates in the US to a more normal, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here's how some areas of the economy might have reacted, depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the last month or so, waiting for an increase in the rate may lead to volatility for some time.
When the rate is raised, however, the consequences are usually less dramatic.
"It doesn't seem to slow down the shares for 12 to 24 months after the first race, which again probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes.
More specifically, the market is more likely to shift upwards over the past 35 years - about 14 per cent - and remains relatively flat within 250 days (average 2.6 per cent growth), and then, after 500 days, returns to normal conditions with an average return of 14.4 per cent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the major trade strategy expert at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to become more pronounced at the rate-growth stage, and the share income is beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they are often encouraged by higher rates.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is subject to conditions that have not existed before and may speed up the recession.
Most of the gross domestic product will be at its lowest point in the lifetime of the high rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, only twice the nominal annual GDP had been under 4.5 per cent of the increase since 1950.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will last long, while it is only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlantic Fed.
The rise in rates on such a volatile economic background can be risky and raises the question of “will it be different this time,” reported Deutsche.
The members of the market are preparing to raise the rates of the Federal Reserve for the whole year, with their views tied to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
So far, many strategy experts and economists believe that FOMC was able to approve the rate hike at this meeting, futures trade is only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study, from 1950, all the hikes to date have been in a super-cycle of growing financial leverage at the top of the GDP, which overcuts the peaks that precede the recession very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report states.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession, a record of 35 months, which lasts for 74 months, and is not over.
Fixed income has also become unstable, while the market is looking forward to higher rates, and this scenario is in a way similar to the one that is being marketed for shares.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will be faster than for shares when the federal system shifts the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the return changes the vector as soon as the first increase/lower rate in the cycle is in place.
At the end of the hike cycle, bond returns are falling immediately,” Deutsche reports.
Policy experts in Charles Schwab believe that raising the rate will make long-term and short-term bond returns closer, making the curve more flat.
High-return bonding is often best in this climate, although "we're still afraid of fluctuations in profitability," says a study by Cathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Shwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal system's policies.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are signs that the market has set itself up for a more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
The interest rate for short-term loans has risen, the rate of return is flatter, the credit fronts have increased, and the volatility has increased - all market characteristics, while the federal system is tightening up.
Generally speaking, companies that run a major business in the US will benefit from an increase in interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with multiple debts will be in the worst position, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace and their debt more expensive in the financial world.
"The story shows that `quality' shares are more effective than the market within three months of the initial rate hike," said Goldman Sachs analysts in the client report.
Firms with a stable financial situation have been overtaken by companies with unstable conditions in each rate hike in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as low volatility shares, have also shown greater efficiency than low-quality shares by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Duty will be a big question.
High-denominated companies with a floating rate will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to pure stock exchange, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Inputers could also see profit through higher returns, although experts diverge in how fast this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of the Classic FM", claims by the Conservative Member Andrew Bingham.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "degrading standards"
Proves it's getting less different from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was just cut off from the Brits.
A member of Parliament, Damien Collins, who crashed on The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is becoming a Classic FM," said the leader of the Parliament, encouraging the radio company to prove that it is doing something that business companies are not doing.
A member of Parliament from conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC management that it seemed that the public radio station was "fooling" and was becoming less and less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 looks like - I don't like using the word "simplification" - but it looks like it's turning into a Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like the Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- here's two examples that came to my mind first, in which you're actually just copying what's already on the market,' said Mr. Bingham.
The Director General of BBC rejected the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial rival when it comes to live music and the education of the audience.
What I learn from Radio 3 I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performances and music is not really like anyone else.
"It's also very important, I think, the interest of Radio 3 in the search for new music and in the promotion of new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's manager, Alan Davey, claimed that radio stations had to work a lot more to attract audiences than in the past, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of the BBC who was attacked for attacking the heels of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because of the lack of originality and characterization?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in the "BBC Typical Style".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit in her own stable" the next time it started the entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to block the future ordering of the new seasons of The Voice or the use of the money of those who pay the licence fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have slowed down as much as possible in August, and Black Friday may be the reason.
Online sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month, there was the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago using mobile shopping devices
The experts are convinced that November's Black Friday might have helped to contain the waste
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been booming, transforming many central streets in Britain into phantom cities.
But experts say that there are now signs of levelling online sales, after the latest data show only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August had shown minimal growth since it had begun to be recorded in 2000, increasing by only 5 per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of levelling online sales after the latest data show only a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the rate of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, they've always found a reasonable explanation," said the Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do it under any circumstances, like sitting on the couch.
But now it's coming out on the plateau, and you can see the decline.
The Black Friday Phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowing down of sales.
The experts believe that buyers may have been able to refrain from shopping on the eve of the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers rushed to the computers to make use of the lucrative offers, bringing down a number of sales websites.
The experts believe that Black Friday, when the buyers are taking a real fight for lucrative purchases, might have made people refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a little over 1 pound sterling out of every 5 is spent online.
With regard to products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more readily than in fancy shops in central streets.
Muslims bury those who have been killed in the fall of a crane in Mecca, and the Bin Laden family is being punished
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead in the streets, as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the crash on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people had also been injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims flowed all over the street to bury 29 of the victims who had lost their lives as a result of the collapse of the crane at Mecca's main mosque.
Dressed mostly in white, those present at the funeral flooded the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed by a sacred site, where only a few days earlier the building crane had struck the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parish.
The bodies had been issued for the funeral, and at the same time the King of Saudis had fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people had also been injured.
The bodies of the 29 parishioners killed in a crane crash at the main mosque were carried down the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Kasim Akram, from Bolton, the Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was at the main mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left an arrow of the tap up when the crane was not running.
The Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press, states that the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English news agency did not mention the details, but reported that the company's leaders had been barred from moving out of the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the crane's fall in the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had flown to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the crane crash, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improperly coordinating with the Meteorological Service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Mecca Main Mosque, as part of the extensive construction work being carried out by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Bin Laden family has been among the closest to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and has been running major construction projects.
The late Al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a treacherous, whom the family disowned in the 1990s.
The accident took place in the midst of strong winds and rains just a few days before millions of people came to the Kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is binding at least once in a lifetime for every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
The officials ordered the payment of one million rials (about 174,000 pounds) to the families of the victims, and the same amount was irreversibly crippled.
The rest of the victims will receive half of that.
Chapter B&Q states that the trend is due to the existence of East European masters working for small money.
According to Veronique Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair experts.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is on the rise
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent of the Daily Mail
They say the British put hammers and paint brushes aside, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do work at home.
If you know how to use a hammer or how to paint walls, you seem to be a minority today.
Because, according to the B&Q owner, the British are still hiring professional masters to do simple chores.
Veronica Lori, the new director-general of Kingfisher, who runs a network of home-building services, reported that this trend is followed by a significant inflow of skilled masters from Eastern Europe, offering services at a minimum cost.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open an additional 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craftsmen's products, while closing 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in the B&Q store staff, as eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by the low sex.
Currently, the majority of staff are men.
According to her, recent demographic trends, with an increase in the number of single-sex households, which were more concerned with housing than in the past, could not be overlooked.
Mrs. Lori said, "Our shops are still dominated by men.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the goods purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women at the helm of the leading British companies, whose shares are included in the FTSE 100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team by getting equal numbers of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the general and financial director.
Mrs. Lori said, "It was a deliberate decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
It was easy to find suitable women on the board.
After the group claimed the cost of closing the shops, Kingfisher showed a six-month decline in profits and sales.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time to decide on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the Federal Reserve Bank's two-day meeting to discuss the most important decision to raise interest rates for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists by Reuters found that just over half of those who thought last week that the Federal Reserve was going to do so now believe that it would wait and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank can move from zero to start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, the lead member of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The US economy works efficiently, the economic upturn adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the impact that the decision will have on the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared for change, but it was clear to them that all the chances were against it.
The decision will be announced at 8:00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: the refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"Open!", chanted hundreds of refugees at the Khorgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for the displaced.
Asylum-seekers are already beginning to test other routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
The other, via Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some data, the buses that had taken the refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shidu on the Croatian border.
Drivers had been ordered by the authorities to follow unstopped.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojša Stepanovic, assures us that his country is doing everything in its power to help the refugees, but that its capacity is limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help those people to be treated humanely.
But that is already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to resolve, and no country in Europe can do it alone, much less a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is unfailing:
If a person calls himself a refugee, in Serbia he must complete the necessary documents.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country, because it's safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already built a 175-tikl-metre fence at the border with Serbia.
But Orban is not going to stop at this; he is planning to erect the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
"Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Meimarakis had been a member of the law-centric government for a number of years, which, in the view of the left, had led to a financial crisis.
Now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, he is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist, Euronews.
Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by subverting the SIRISA coalition, but, according to polls, New Democracy is now as popular as it is.
What has changed in that time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsiprus lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
The country is now again facing fiscal deficits and high levels of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras had banished them.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises made by Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare the promise with what really happened.
Day - to - day life has been markedly worse than in January, when the situation improved, with the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SIRIS.
The fact is, as we have learned in recent years, that Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no accident that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, political forces and all the ruling parties have come together to implement a programme under which they have reached agreement, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's lenders.
If you become the new premiere on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
In fact, we voted in favour of Greece's movement on the European road, because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences that a country's exit from the EU would have.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, Juncker's package, and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there had not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsiprus's negotiating process.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So, if Europe sees that the new Greek government wants to bring about order in the first year of power, is rational and makes it clear that the country has the strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of what leads to a recession can be negotiated again, but only after some time.
It would be wrong to believe that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they look forward to the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to take advantage of EU financing and the greater investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Tsipras did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have learned by discussing with our European counterparts.
I can give you an example of the farmer's income.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, so it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Tsipras had never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and ill-informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Holland, Miss Merkel, and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
First of all, I'll explain to them that before the end of 2014, we tried to best implement the 2012 agreement, by bypassing the sharp angles in it.
We have advanced reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extreme circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers ready to pay the price that the Greek government had given.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which were then the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences over key bills, we had a working Parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations taking place outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would have continued to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: In recent weeks, a mass flow of refugees has been on Greek territory.
What do you think of this situation, and of the reactions of the European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after the election.
And the reason is that the SIRISA government did not act in the way it should.
In such matters, we have to act ahead, because if the problem catches up with you, we have to take extraordinary measures.
And that's what we're in now.
Even the interim government that replaced SIRIS had done more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras had done in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim Government, which is being given valuable support by the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will help to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that have occurred to them.
There is a profound humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will follow the position that European politicians must adopt in this new situation.
A decision must be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border control and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance that the EU is getting to deal with this pressing problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Milkykovka Donetsk oblast, for 24 hours, the criminal investigation officers of the General Police Department of the Region, together with the military counter-intelligence, identified and detained a suspect who was found to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Krivoy Rog, Dnepropetrov oblast, who had been in the course of the evening of the joint use of alcohol, and the conflict that had erupted in the village of Upper-Terrectek Yasinovat district of Donetchina fired a machine gun at his opponent.
A 22-year-old boy was reported injured from the hospital, where he was hospitalized with cross-fired legs.
According to Artem Vasitski, Deputy Head of the Department of Criminal Investigation of the Police Chief of the Region, during the course of the operations, the law enforcement officers had proved that the figure had been involved in another serious criminal offence, the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that the same day there was a conflict between the suspect and another local resident, resulting in a fatal gunshot wound to the man's head.
The Investigative Department of the Milkovsky Gogo has opened criminal proceedings under the articles “Intentional murder” and “Intentional serious bodily harm” of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
Detainees face up to 15 years ' imprisonment.
The figure was detained and placed in a temporary holding cell and reported to the Donetsk police.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted a number of Soviet monuments in the color of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced to imprisonment by a Russian court.
Two more residents of the city had been sentenced to restriction of liberty.
Novosibirsk residents have been sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicted persons had been subjected to a 14- and 18-month restriction of liberty.
The Leninsk Court of Novosibirsk found the four citizens guilty of vandalism against Lenin monuments, which were located on the territory of the CPRC and on the Street of Trikots, as well as the monumental complex of the Monument of Glory.
In the latter case, the Katyusha missile and tank T-34 were painted.
Recall, on the night of December 12, in Russia's Novosibirsk, the unknown painted in the color of the Ukrainian flag military technology at the Monument of Glory.
The civil wife of the popular Russian actor Yevgeny Zyganov Irina Leonov gave birth to a seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The new baby and her mom are feeling good.
Let me remind you, Gypsies and Leonov recently broke up.
Eugenius refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambition.
Eugenia Zyganov is 36 years old.
He is the actor of the Moscow Theatre "The Master's Peter Fomenco".
Familiar to the films Walking, Cosmos As a Premonition, Brest Fortress, Otepelle, and Farza.
On 8 September, Evgeny Zyganov was recognized as the "Acté of the Year" and "The Man of the Year" in the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
The man who opened the shooting at the University of Delta left a note of apology.
After the shooting and murder of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his coworker later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note that said that he "repent" about the first murder and wanted to "return everything back," the authorities informed on Tuesday.
Police in Gauthier, Mississippi, reports that a professor of geography and social science at the University of Delta called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also said that there was a "dog" in the house that "can't touch anyone," but probably upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shooting.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a hand-written note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm sorry I'd like to get it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb traveled 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, and on the night of Monday, when he was surrounded by the police, he killed himself.
The president of the University, William Laforge, said that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb had something in mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb was supposed to have an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official services on Tuesday reported “the absence of any information or evidence” of the “loving triangle”.
He referred to him as "good man" Sean O'Stin, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They got divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Stin told me he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter and that she was "inconsoled."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lyndsey Knowles, which the Sun Herald newspaper calls a close friend of Prentiss's, the last one worked from home online.
Knowles told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog called Lightning, and that she was dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family on Monday at some point to say "he's not going to jail."
On the night of the same day, when the police hit him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods, and shot himself.
According to a summary posted on a university website, Lamb received a PhD in the field of pedagogical science at the University of Delta in the spring of 2015.
Stars Losing their Happiness
The actor (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has experienced a number of difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term life companion, Farru Fosette, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reported to have suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this, of course, played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United got out for a few months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the match of the League of Champions, where Manchester United lost the PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defence counsel is concerned about this, which will not be able to get out of the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaul hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during the reckless reprisal of Hector Moreno at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty zone.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then he'll be operated on.
It's awful - a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame the big deal and started playing fantastic, and that's when it happened.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy won't be able to play the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno's lucky he didn't get the red card and he didn't get the penalty.
The Arbitrator, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge yourself when I say it's worth the penalty and the red card.
It was a very bad double-legged stool.
In his tweet, Shaw writes, "Thanks to everyone for your messages, not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will return even more than I was."
On the other hand, the Manchester United is experiencing a disaster with Luke Shaw in the PSV game.
The British defender will have an additional incentive to recover to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coke, coach PSV, said, "This is a very serious injury."
When any player gets out of this kind of trauma, everyone's very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to traumatize the opponent.
Moreno had a broken leg when he was playing for Mexico against the Dutch team, led by Van Gal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him right now, because he had no intention of wounding the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, you don't feel well," said Koku.
I didn't have a chance to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like it (Moreno) touched it, but I didn't see a pod for Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6 Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure.
It's very hard for me, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Garardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorakes?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your kid likes a book, it'll take a little while before you get to know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question from a representative of a company that organizes children's holidays about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister selected the Lorakes, an environmental fairy tale written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, and Cameron wrote in a comment published on the SuperCamps website, and goes on to say, "This is a fun, moving, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children, because it always shows an image or a message that we miss."
And it would be all right, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to rewrite the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the same-name movie, made in 2012, with new characters and details added to make a relatively short original story.
"In the high-walled town of Thundernawville, where there was no green and even no air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart, the girls of her dream, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," we read in the text a description of the love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (the real name is Theodore Sues Gazelle), who died in 1991.
If it doesn't seem suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of the film's "Lorakes", posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high walls of the city of Tshrugville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girls of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, who is admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns of how a greedy tree cutter and a "all-nothing" jarper of Neidkins is destroying the environment, despite the protests of Loraks (whose name is in the title of the book) - a funny creature with a mustache that "speaks on behalf of the tree".
It is likely that this simple PR task was assigned to an artist who never read a book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly received from the office of Cameron in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments were received.
Adam Lit was clearly at risk of not joining the England team, but it's still a complex question.
Winning Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England selected for this tour, it's not possible to repeat the 3-0 test series that happened last time.
I wouldn't rule out a victory in my field either.
The team of Alistair Cooke may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it has players, virtually using twisted balls, and collective thinking strong; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only a youthful positive.
With Moin Ali's ball, it turns into a bowler who's pitching the twisted ball, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
On the subject: Adam Lit left England for a test cricket and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to remove Adam Lit to me, his main coach at Yorkshire, is of course hard to analyse.
His seven test games had two good attacks under difficult circumstances, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricket players are judged by the judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said so before) the players choose themselves best.
A couple of semi-tones, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more shots for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well about his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's first of all a team player, and then everything else.
The question is how long it's gonna take before the test cricket batsman leaves an impression of it is a complex question.
Lit played seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play in his and his field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's the Batsman I value high.
He's an unpredictable cricketist, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club earlier this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those before him, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening betsman, which would make it possible to introduce an extra spinner by keeping four speed bowlers, is thinking about it, and I don't mind it at all.
I don't see why a hitter can't beat the ball out there, and this left-handed guy already shows that he's a hell of a cricket player.
Moen may not be exactly what it takes for his County Woostershire, but it's become the third number for them, and there's no big difference.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test games "the third batsman" before he was released as a starter in 2001.
He won 300 at once and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari joins the team as a back-up spinner, and in my brief contact with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his model stats -- an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky bet, but there's a small number of spinners voting for, and the selectors choose youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England is planning to make a few practical additions to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardin, a Sri Lankan Batsman, as a consultant for the test games, could be a master's move.
He's one of the best guys for a game that's gonna bring in the best of experience under all possible conditions and any kind of attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games that use the white ball, and will provide both energy and a merciless pace in the set.
I've always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's a game or a coaching job, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what was said earlier, can give new power to the team.
Collie's teammate Durham Ben Stokes is left for a day, Ruth is given a similar break in Australia, and I, for example, have no problem with it.
Though not everyone will agree, coaches and pick-ups don't set a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The British exit camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived policy of resuming negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is becoming more and more complex every day, even without looking back at the selection of the genius Jeremy-"Is that right or not?"- Corbin's a leader of labor or the TUC's resentment for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and Nigel Farajis.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that, in the current EU situation, a multiplicity of crises - not all of them their own - some of the member countries are fed up with the British self-centric agenda of sifting concessions and undermining agreements for change that they do not want to do.
Having met in Brighton for an annual meeting, the TUC decided that he didn't want them anyway if they were destroying social security.
We could even call it "the selfie program of Dave and George."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance rides at summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves against the background of a well-known local monument, a company of local celebrities, or without it, and then come home and say that they attract allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European buddy, who wants to be interested in maintaining British external contacts under the EU Tent - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - proposes that the noisy ministers and officials in some capitals reach an understanding when they don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she's been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation for her worsens, as it worsened for the 11-year-old Thatcher, Mitterrand (14) and Kola (16).
The head of France, François Hollande, stands for re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland can soon get a right-hand nationalist government, Spain to the left.
It's hard to see them coming out of their skins to help the sephi-brits whose energy could be used to prevent Scotland from getting out of the UK, which they don't want, too, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan to hand out wilfully useless SNP-style remorse during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to boost the British withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"Revision was an idea-fix" and "British did not get any value from the resumed talks."
Europeans know what kind of predator Fleet Street can be, and how sceptical media-magnets are to the EU, unlike Tony Ben's 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a hardened Euro-opportunist, famous for his “direct EU bananas” by a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In spite of his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a small company of tax-hungering crooks, foreign phone hackers, and pseudo-residents, who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was quite the same opinion about them, but he realized that when you're in a cell with a raging gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and keep her from eating you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair himself to opposing Cameron's idea of a referendum, because Blair had failed in favor of the abrogated EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a win-win ticket.
The press never forgave him any of this.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who was a friend of mine at Westminster on Monday -- I told him he didn't have time to waste it on me -- looks like he's risking repeating Neil Kinnock's strategy "Bocott Murdock" from the '80s -- a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy to interact with the press - not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on whose Air Force couch he was sitting on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he'd like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the tradition of the Ukip and the wider range of "little England's sidemen" among the Toryes might say "yes."
It's the same thing as Hilary-Benn, but not Bennit-Benn said on radio and TV this week, and his inner Boy Scout refused to admit that Corbin's appointment to the unspeakable John McDonnell's "shadow" finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father-in-law was fighting hard on TV for being disloyal to his Labour Office colleagues, without going too far or losing his position in the Cabinet.
Hilary's battle was more appealing.
But the fight to stay "in all circumstances," Benna's phrase, is not what McDonnell said, or what J.K. said to the Peers and Members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, in general opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and "his boyfriend" Corbin wanted to tell me - remember, he even touched me - the discipline of messages remains important in the 24-hour television age seven days a week, and especially in the spiral of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and treachery.
It is wise to keep Cameron from getting away from Europe so easily, allowing him to accept as due support the laborers during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the main misconception of McDonnell and Corbin about EU membership - in the “bennite” economy of besieged fortress - is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, which is a small difference, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about Nato - Tom Watson's unshakeable fact that J.K. will not agitate for exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on British concessions, when it can all be pointless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory Government is in power to cut the costs, as I was reminded of on Monday's lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
A government-funded agency has claimed that cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking, and 12 people, some of whom are linked to the tobacco industry, have been heard at the meeting, according to researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published an important report, the "turn point" last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of evidence."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts to the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the Journal of Medicine, Lancet last month criticized the “extremely shaky argument” on which PHE built its main opinion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether the statements had “hard or frustrating reasons”.
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: “The fundamental principle of health - the rules must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
According to them, the public expected PGE statements that “the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this emerges from the only meeting of 12 people who have met to develop a model of multicriteria of decision-making in order to synthesize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKey and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT health certificates in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the producer of electronic cigarettes, without mentioning the funding that he had previously received from the Philip Morris tobacco company.
No reasonable explanation was given for the selection of the board members, but some of them are well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of whom have also stated that the industry is being financed in the publication.
It is not known whether the other participants in the meeting have any experience in the management of the tobacco business.
The head of the tobacco station in PHE also visited the meeting.
A scientific article published by the group “approachably accepts” that there is a lack of “hard evidence of the harmful effects of most products according to most criteria”, wrote McKey and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were addressed in the PHE report.
McKey and Capewell said that the PHE statements that “there is no evidence at present that electronic cigarettes are expensive, leading to children or non-smoking” are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of the health and well-being field at the PGE, said that BMJ applications had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of what the evidence proves and does not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die a year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs NHS 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly, while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only cause part of the harm caused by smoking - we do our tasks to the nation.
Former head of Channel 4 believes that BBC should stop the EastEnders show.
Former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop producing programs like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would pay a lot for a successful show like the soap opera on "Albert's Life".
Johnson noted that license fees should be used only to create software that is not produced by other British radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are probably only a small part of the audience, at the peak airtime when the competitors have a high-rated show, and on channels like BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the Corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson observed that he had been trying to work with BBC for six years without success while working at Channel 4.
"I can't help but think that the BBC is preparing to launch and is broadcasting programs that might show rival companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told the members of the House of Lords' Communications Committee as part of the BBC's future.
If you keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good medium- and long-term solution, then the company should keep on the air only those programs that are not being released and are not going to be released by other companies.
The Voice show is aired in the prime segment because the creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else will show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to finance transfers that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, the EastEnders is the other; it is well known that they are their own.
Other channels would no doubt have given up a lot for it.
I don't know how this can be a public service.
I don't think it'd lower the BBC in any way.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings "due to the ambitions of the staff and to their belief that this is the best way to get support for a long time."
His comments on the most popular show on BBC echoed the comments of the executive director of Sky Tony Ball, who in his McTaggart Memory Lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 offered BBC to sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson observed that the more low-level public BBC broadcasts “continue to go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to estimate the audience, but the function of the company is performed, and this can be presented as an argument in the practitioner's sermons justifying the 4-billion-billion-billion-billion-dollar income: "Well, of course, we're doing all these incomprehensible shows that no one is watching."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
With regard to the license fee, Johnson told the committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system as to who will get the most out of it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 quid a year is a huge sum, but for people for whom 150 quid is a lot of money, I wonder, they think that's because they don't really watch and listen to BBC.
Former executive director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also addressed the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate Rita's mission to "inform, educate, and entertain."
He noted that only a small fraction of the BBC output is now formally classified as educational - 1% of the TV content and 0.1% of the radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto of “inform, educate and entertain”.
In the area of partnership, Elstein observed that BBC should do more in such areas as “External concerts” (only a part of them, he said, is on TV) and join alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available online.
"Sofogenetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction of motion when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have extracted worms with a genetically modified neural system that can be controlled by sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change their direction at the moment when they are affected by sound impulses, too high for the human ear to hear them.
Impulses have an effect by activation of neurons that are genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
On the subject: Researchers manage brain activity by means of light
Scientists have said that worms show the potential of a new method called "sonogenetics", which is to use ultrasound to excite certain brain, heart, and muscle cells, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Solk Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this method might one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Nematod worms usually don't react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they started to react when they were put in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles were intensifying ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
Increased ultrasonic waves affect structures called the "ion channels TRP-4" found in the membrane of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open up and inflame the cells that are linked to them, as reported in the Nature Communications report.
To create the nematode that can be controlled by ultrasonics, Chalasani has made genetic changes to the worms, so their motor neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the application of ultrasound to modified organisms, sound waves were reinforced with microscopic bubbles and injected into worms by activating modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to that used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to switch on and off neurons by means of light pulses.
Chalasani states that there may be some advantages to stoogenetics in comparison with this method.
In contrast to the light brought to the right section of the brain by the fiber optics, low-frequency ultrasonic waves flow easily through the body tissue, so they do not need to be delivered inside the cranial box.
"We believe that in order to treat some neurological diseases in clinical settings, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will temporarily make human neurons sensitive to ultrasonic signal," said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the method could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements mocked the British arms trade
See Amnesty International's video protesting the arms show.
Amazing killer drones!
Destroying iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise truncheons that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave traces!
A stern voice and a painted animation leave no doubt that this advert to the largest international arms exhibition is a bitter emoticon prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to “stotter” weapons to repressive regimes by using the ExCeL-centre in Dockland's Defence Technology and Security Expo.
On the topic: DSEI Arms Expo: Autoritary Regimes Going to London
But the special campaign also results in the sudden arrival of a lot of posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which require another look at them.
"An important ad on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them in the London subway fonts, with the image of the DLR line, which is becoming a silhouette tank.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will enter the DLR line. The passengers are being asked to help prevent the arms show.
300 banners are painted by artists who put out their works at the "Museum of Bad Design" in Banksy Park "Dismaland".
A group called Special Patrol has helped to distribute them to London, using a “advertiser set”, a six-pound set of gadget keys, which is said to “provide access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stops on the planet”.
London's transporters don't enjoy this "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the initial announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and eager to bring political art to the audience outside the gallery.
Many artists are starting to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out to the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another anti-arms exhibition poster welcoming passengers in the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by a pro bono VCCP, with a graphic designer and an artist, who also works free of charge.
Creative VCCP Director Matt Lever was struck by the ad-hoc silence around the arms show - with an ExCel pass on the calendar - and thought, "Let's get them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and sly corporate ad, but "to fill it at home with bright colors and animation was more exciting."
"They have incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take measures and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of the arms exhibition is from the inside of ExCeL, where the participants trade in fantastic euphemic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order for "AT4CS RS from the shoulder" from the U.S. Army.
It includes a “non-external cumulative weapon that produces an insurmountable armoured force inside the target”.
Whatever he's doing, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules of residence in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dorm as a normal 19-year-old who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but it is only now that I remember the strained smiles of the people I irritated, and the many, long complaints against others.
For the most part, what I've learned can be sorted out by eight simple rules.
Moving to a hostel can range from a bit of a nerve to a completely frightening one.
He makes you talk about telling people where you've come from, whether you've taken the academic leave and where you've spent it, whether you're supporting Corbin, and why you're "honestly, I don't love, I don't hate "Marmite," because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract of HAHA, I'll be in my place."
Take a break.
And help others take a break too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire, and they'd be handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinks, midnight cinemas, and commonplaces, but they are also the place where people dress and fix underwear.
On the other hand, don't even think about starting a university when you're in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a safe haven, but many dorms form a culture of dilapidation from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication, and long friendships.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to regain power.
Nothing in culture lets you say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to go, and I can restore the energy that I've spent on socializing with you."
Try to feel like a fellow student is tired of communicating - not knocking on him, but texting him.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorm was following this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
Since you're starting college life at the peak of the Bake-Off show, knocking on the door to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies is no longer a strange act, not so much like the 1950s with "Welcome, we're neighbors, I made you something, and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."
It's a good way to be friends when you offer homeies.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually your face will probably be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly blinded lumps of flour, sugar, and fat will make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
Of course, the embezzlement of someone's chicken is theft, but is it theft to take a little milk for tea?
Make it work with the owner of the milk.
He's probably gonna tell you not to be shy, even if it's hot inside out of rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry for you - but try to deal with it a little bit more than my neighbor, who poured some dishwashing liquid in her milk to get back at the guy who took it out of the question.
She's in prison now.
You don't have to make any noise that will keep people from sleeping or learning.
Not just to be a decent man, but also because you're the same people in the glass-houses saying.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to slow down the drums and bass guitars, because it was 3:00 in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In return, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5:00 a.m., she mercifully let him sleep for two hours, and then cut off her music and locked the door behind him, leaving for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband lived in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extreme, before biting elbows, clumsy, if you'd take a neighbor for your future husband, get into it, break up a relationship, and have to see it every day, and maybe watch it drag all of your common friends on his side?
Of course, you can't tell the heart - but if a hot neighbor is definitely not your future husband, try to cool off your own anger a little.
At that thrilling moment, when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked-up room, the line between prank and molester is thinner than it looks.
A good joke is fun, but it turns into the opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never smack someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the wrong door and put the keys in a glass of water that you'll put in the freezer - but don't stick the other's stuff with Blu-Tack on the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the Apple update
You can request a new operating system from the Settings application to select General, and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download it and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installing a bug report telling them that “Renewing the application failed”.
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the rejuvenation is down or try to update via iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to complete the process.
The process may include the removal of applications to expand the space, but Apple has minimized the probability of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also made it easier to perform with a special tool that proposes to remove the applications and re-insert them after the completion of the process.
It is worth making sure that your cell phone is loaded or next to the charger in order to prevent the battery from being decommissioned.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop refreshing, as decommissioning of the phone may result in a failure of the update.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by calling.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support provided by Moscow to President Assad only led to an exacerbation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague, writing PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“The Secretary of Kerry made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad puts the risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, as well as adversely affecting our common goal of combating extremism, unless we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through the direct transfer of power,” the representatives of the US State Department stated.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the US's commitment to the fight against the Islamic State in a coalition of over 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be a member.
In addition, the US “will welcome Russia's constructive role in trying to confront the Islamic State.”
Last Friday, representatives of the White House said that they did not know exactly what the Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was about to discuss the matter with Moscow.
In fact, White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet come: "When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will be in our interest, then he will pick up the phone and try to make the call."
Barack Obama himself sees Russia's decision to increase support for Assad's regime as a “lost stake.”
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake, that continued support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he did not heed my warnings - and as a result the situation deteriorated," the President of the United States said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from the payment of customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating facilities for rest and sport from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of soft items for temporary duty-free entry have been prepared by the Ministry at the request of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashkin, reported this to the News.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of the Russian Federation, following his visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of agencies - Minaconomy, Mintrans Russia, Minticulture, MFA, MSS, FSB, FTS, Rostourism - to prepare proposals to create an enabling environment for yachting in the country ' s coastal zones.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
The owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about 1,200 million go to the trenches of European States each year for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of the yacht.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission “On the amendment of the list of goods temporarily imported with complete conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other recreational and sporting items”.
In the view of the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for the development of yachting in the country ' s coastal zones, Lashkin noted.
This issue was brought to the attention of the Subcommission on Customs, Tariff, Non-Tariff, Safeguards in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure of full conditional release on import is in essence a benefit.
Therefore, following the adoption of the minutes of the meeting of the Subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member States of the EEEC, and explained to Lashkin.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from the payment of customs duties, taxes, includes the goods needed to promote external economic activity and international cooperation, for use in science, culture, film, sport and tourism, for international assistance, etc. These include service equipment (computers, typewriters), monitors, drilling equipment, stage suits and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racers, motorcyclists, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and religious objects.
In the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, "Ivestiyas" reported that binding orders had been issued on the ports of Kerci, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatory, which provided for a simplified procedure for the entry and exit of small, sporting and recreational vessels to the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport is charged to the captains of the ports of Crimea to ensure that small, sporting and recreational vessels enter the port of the sea and that these ships exit the port of the sea.
Mintransom has also prepared draft orders from the Government of the Russian Federation for the approval of the waters of the seaports of Crimea.
In the case of Yalta and Theodosia, orders have already been issued, and the rest are in the process of being agreed upon, as noted in the press service of the Department.
In the view of the Ministry of State, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol are required to carry out a State registration, classification and inspection of small-scale vessels used for non-profit purposes.
The problem is that in Russia the yachting is very hard because of the poor infrastructure.
If you look to the south of Italy and France, it's a whole ever-growing industry that involves a large number of people.
In fact, in Russia, everything is still in place.
Our shores are not very interesting, the only piece of yachts that can be exploited all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelenjik, Novorussia, Anapa.
But the big complication is that in this area the border control is very strict: to go out on the yacht, a lot of permits must be issued.
Besides, there's no place to refill a yacht inside Russia.
She can go with her fuel for two days, and then the problem is where to get it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
With regard to yacht storage sites, there are now special anchorages for yachts up to 30 metres in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Yachts are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany for storage.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the start of the crisis, the demand for yachts declined.
The World Bank has provided Ukraine with a $500 million loan.
The World Bank has approved a new $500 million loan project for Ukraine to develop the financial sector.
This was reported by the international organization ' s press service.
“New financing will support a number of priority measures for reform in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine,” states the report.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Timao Fan, said that the reform of the banking sector would help re-establish credit in the real economy and stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that the World Bank was witnessing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, the Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reform.
Previously, the Polish government had approved a loan to the Y100 million Ukraine, transmitting the RIA News.
Prisons are being asked to set up separate units for transgenders.
The Public Council of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences (FSIN) for the Protection of the Rights of Sentenced Persons in October 2015 will discuss, among other things, the possibility of establishing separate units in the colonies for transgender and transvestite persons.
Councilman Vladislav Grib told them about this.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-sex-determined convicts in Russia, it was possible to establish separate cells, blocks or even (if there were many) in domestic prisons in the future to create a special colony for transgender persons.
However, Vladislav Gryb stresses that it is only possible to determine whether to serve the sentence of a citizen in such isolated places after the convicted persons have had appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice worked well abroad: the SIZO (where the accused are pre-trial) had separate cells for transgender persons, and the correctional facilities had special units.
Today, it is the only way to work with such criminals.
There is a clear need to isolate them, since the presence of transvestites and transgenders in normal cells is dangerous to them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of trouble for FSIN staff.
The debasement of the trances on the side of the cellmates is assured,' said Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, the number of indeterminate sex offenders, we also have to figure out where to distribute them.
There's no specific need for some - just cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgenders.
As the Gryb explained, the block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialty unit is established in Russia alone, transgender prisoners can go to the prison in any region.
Citizens are held in the SIZO at the place where the crime was committed, so the arrival of transvestites or transgenders from other subjects during the investigation and trial is not feasible, but to introduce such a practice for those who have already been convicted in a separate colony - yes, the Gypsy is of the view.
We recall that the previous day law enforcement officials had not been able to determine which pretrial detention centre, male or female, had been held for the possession of drugs by 24-year-old transgender Dmitri Kojukov (known as Aline Davis), and a man and a girl had not been arrested.
He was released home under a non-exit subscription.
This news has been widely discussed in social media and media, as the mechanism for holding transgender people in SIZOs and colonies in Russia does not yet exist.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alexeyev supported the idea of creating special spaces for transgender prisoners to serve their sentences, noting that it is also possible to define people in a colony - male or female - abroad, depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yes, it is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as is the issue of security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alexeyev.
Prisons must be safe, so separate blocs could be made in the name of and for homosexuals, especially since there are more in prisons than transgenders.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubtes that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to pretend to be transsexuals in order to enter a different colony.
Of course, you can introduce a medical check-up before you put people in a transgender colony, but it's not always clear.
In the United States, for example, one of Chelsea Menning's prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison, he said he wanted to change sex, he said to Alexeyev.
A person can feel like anything.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve the sentence for transgender people, I doubt that the prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people and understand the subtleties of their orientation or their sexual identity.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender offenders in the colony could greatly delay the start of the sentence.
A commission is set up - it's a matter of sexology, and psychiatrists do long-term observations, and it's not one test that makes a very accurate conclusion.
Today's psychiatry is possible.
So, even before the sex change, potential patients are always subjected to such tests - they are sure to show whether sex change with surgery is a necessary measure,” says Lordshipidze.
However, it is hard for me to see how this system can be applied to convicts, since it takes on average a month to do so.
Although the idea of creating separate units for transsexuals was generally supported by the doctor, it is also doubtful whether, in the current economic environment, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, transgender units in Russia.
It's hard to figure out, there's no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it can be said that the transgender is even smaller, and that those who have such a deviation and commit crimes are very small, say Lordship.
At present, at the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender persons can already receive separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Cup of chess.
The World chess championship for young people under the age of 20 was completed in Hunte-Mansca.
The end of the first place was more than intriguing.
The victor was determined only in the last round, and he became a Russian Michael Antipov, who was still able to catch up with the Pole, Jan-Kshištoph Doudou, who seemed to be on his way to the title.
The girls celebrated the victory by the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Bux.
The World chess Champion, held in Hunte-Mansburg in early September, seemed to have lost most of the intrigue by the middle of the tournament, as the Polish representative, Jan-Xischtof Douda, who had awarded a series of four victories (the competitions are held on the Swiss system in 13 tours), had taken the lead with confidence.
Given that Douda was the top-favorite rating, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the chance that he would miss the break was very low.
And even when Douda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to narrow the gap to only 0.5, he remained a clear favorite in the title struggle.
After all, Antipov had to win the 13th round to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help if you won Dood your party.
Plus, this binding victory, of course, could have had an impact on the Russian chess player's game and lead to non-binding mistakes.
Happily, Mikhail Antipov was able to avoid them.
He handled Francesco Rambaldi with confidence, after which he had to wait for his party to complete the Duda meeting with Benjamin Bok.
Luckily for Antipov, a Polish chess player led to a confrontation with the Dutch man.
So the Antipov and Douda scored an equal number of points, 10 out of the 13 possible, but the Antipov had the best extra scores.
That is why it is to him that the leadership of the Huntia-Mansian Autonomous Region, whose Governor, Natalia Komarov, has traditionally devoted a great deal of attention to the development of chess in the region, has awarded a major prize.
But the girls' competition didn't have an intriguing end.
The leader of the tournament, Natalia Buxe, Ukraine, was not to lose the title in the last round, which she successfully did.
So the victory of the Russians, Aline Bivol, prevented her from catching up with Bux.
The Russian athlete was the second one to lag behind the champion at 0.5.
The ashes change the regional structure.
The company combines the Rajsaw and Ural regions in a single subdivided region of the Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East region of the East.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
According to the president of Wimpelcoma, Michael Slobodin, the changes are being made to “main a strong player in the market,” to develop the company “in a new, not always favourable external environment”.
In an interview with the TV station "Russia 24", Mr. Slobodin explained that they intended to reduce the “ten percent” of the staff in Russia.
Rospiznadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King diners and issued 367 orders.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volocolom Highway was fined 50,000 roubles, and the restaurant on the Grand Tull Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all the irregularities had been resolved.
43 diners violated the requirements for the accommodation.
Among other violations, poor sanitation and sanitation facilities, non-compliance with the ventilation system, some facilities have found intestinal bacteria.
The Burger King brand Frances is owned by the Burger Rus, the owner of the "Shocolate Lady" network, Alexander Kolobov, and has 293 snacks in Russia.
Igor Artemiev, head of the FAS, stated that the agency was against the indexation of 10% of the freight and State subsidies, as requested by the OAO of the RZD.
First, they wanted 17% of indexation, now they want 10%, and they want multi-billion-dollar subsidies from the budget, he says.
We say, it's wrong, it's too much, it's too much, it's too much, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's a lot of money, it's
He added that the FAS has its own, “more stringent” proposals, which are currently being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net-calculation option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of a $300 million-full-grained ticket, a gold-mining company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the value of the shares in favour of Sumeru and market quotations) that can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to implement the option or to ask for extra pay.
The details of the Polymetal talks do not reveal.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of the Polimetal project "Kisil" in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stassin, Director of the Department of Housing Policy of the Ministry of the Interior, reported that the Ministry, together with the BC, was working out a procedure for the rehabilitation of developers.
"We know that it's not going anywhere, so we're developing an appropriate mechanism," said the official.
The designs of the "Citizen Kane" movie will be tendered.
The representatives of the Profiles in History auction house announced plans to tender the screenplays of the film "Citizen Kane", which is considered to be one of the best works of the director, screenwriter, and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will start in the city of Calabas on September 29, with three drafts of the script, the estimated cost of each of them being $200,000 to $30,000, and the AP will be presented.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevich, is the earliest scenario in private collections?
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, and the third is the final design of the film.
Minprompt: Targeted food aid will not be the same as the USSR cards.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evtukhov, said that the target food aid programme would not be the equivalent of the USSR food distribution card system.
This is about modern targeted food assistance to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card."
I should like to point out in particular that the proposed product maps should not be confused with an echo of past total deficits, a card-sharing system, in which the quantity of produce is normalized.
We have, for the time being, proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the law,” the TASS quotes Mr. Eutukhov.
Previously, OS wrote that the food card program for the poor was introduced to the government.
For more information on the Minprompromprogue initiative, see the "OJ" "Igor Shuwalov has commissioned the preparation of food cards".
The president of Rosgosstraha wants to divorce his wife.
The source informed RAPSI that the president of Rosgosstrach's insurance company, Danil Hachatururov, had filed a case with the Moscow Court for the dissolution of the marriage to the designer of Uljana Sergienko.
Judge's Trial Station 100 will begin on 16 September.
Danil Hachatururov asks for the dissolution of his marriage and the sharing of property.
The court confirmed that there was an action for the dissolution of the marriage in the proceedings, noting that the division of property had not been brought and would be heard by the District Court.
President Alexander Bobreshov of the RZZZ resigns.
Alexander Bobreshov, Vice-President of the OAO "Russia Railways" (RZD) for Corporate Security, leaves the company, reports Interfax, citing the source.
The Vice-Premier of Russia, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the RZZR, Arkady Dvorkovich, stated that the issue of the withdrawal from the RZD by Alexander Bobresov had been initiated by the new head of Oleg Belozerorov.
According to the vice-premier, the human resources changes in the management of the RJD are not related to the change of head of the company.
In the past, OOO reported that, in place of Vladimir Yakunin OAO, RZD was the head of the first Under-Secretary of Transport, Oleg Belozerov, who was in charge of the financial block.
The new head of the company announced for the first time reforms in the monopoly: within a year and a half a new system of freight tariffs will be put in place.
For more information on the transformations in the company, see the "RZD will rewrite the values".
This year, a study by the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is being published for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian top-level managers, the study sums up the work of Russian managers over a year, identifying leaders in industry and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of last year's rating winners.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as the current year's rating candidate and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list is invited to nominate up to 10 new managers from other companies, who would be usefully added to the pool.
It is possible to nominate the following managers of the company's functional areas: the Director of Finance, the Director of Commerce, the Director of Marketing, the Director of Staff, the IT Director, the Director of Public and Corporate Relations, the Director of Public Relations, the Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert-proposed manager is invited to participate in the ratings and is given the opportunity to present his management team and up to 10 new managers from other companies.
Nominations by industry are based on the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: Information Technology, Commercial Banks, Forest and Forest Processing, Engineering, Media, Metal, Multidimensional Holding, Professional Services, Communications and Telecommunications, Consumer Products Service, Insurance, Construction, Trade, Transport, Finance, Pharmaceuticals, Chemical Industry, Energy and Fuel Complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to access the website www.top10000.amr.ru, where they see the information on the rest of the participants and can make their estimates on the criteria proposed for each function.
The rating methodology is based on the "best choose the best" principle: top managers rate top managers, functional managers rate functional managers.
Such a principle allows for the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the ratings are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
In-person meetings of the expert commissions are invited to invite all candidates for the current year's ratings and multiple candidates for the previous years' ratings.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: the Commission for the Approval of the List of Top Managers and the eight Commissions for the Approval of Heads of Functions.
The meetings of the expert commissions are invited to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (the sites are kept strictly on the Internet and are closed until the rating is published) or to make updates to them in accordance with the attached list of stand-by candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the rules of the UO.
At the time of the publication of the rating, there are possible changes in the status of managers and companies.
Comfort rate for investment is 10 to 13%.
According to experts, the small and medium-sized business credit market in January-April of this year is 40% low.
What are your estimates of the situation today?
After the panic of late 2014 - early 2015, the level of BMS credit fell significantly.
The reason is clear: the sharp rise in interest rates.
Loaning for 25 to 30 per cent of the annual rate was no good to anyone.
If the bank had previously been able to place all of its possible problems at a higher rate, from delays to non-returns, it is not possible to do so now: the stakes are already cloudy.
For the business, the current rate of UXO credit is inconvenient.
For a large part of the investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their profitability.
A rate of 10 to 13 per cent would allow the business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns.
How do you estimate business demand for credit is being met?
The situation has improved a little since the interest rate of the CB was lowered.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients started to apply for loans much less.
First of all, business does not understand its prospects for development and future incomes.
Today, business has one option: to learn to work on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
There is a need to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor the flow of money.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make the product more competitive and to keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What major trends in the BMS credit market will be strengthened and will affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The medium-rate projection will depend to a large extent on the central bank policy, and the regulator is now demonstrating consistency in the reduction of the core rate.
However, it is not worth waiting for a radical drop in the price of credit for the UXO.
In the current situation, the problem is, first and foremost, inflation, which makes it necessary to increase the interest rate for real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even if the rates of the CB are lower.
With regard to the level of lateness, it is common for small- and medium-sized business companies, which are limited both in their ability to replenish money and in their options for adjustment of economic behaviour, to pose a greater risk to lenders.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the share of bad credit.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and the street fashion.
That's how the word "Mazda" is spelled in Japanese characters.
It's beautiful, delicate, and at the same time very difficult for those who're used to the Cyrillic or the Latin.
So the new CX-5 crossover, like any other brand model, is attractive from the outside, technically perfect from the inside.
Japan's simply because of its “Japanese nature” has the potential to make its attachment to the products of the rising sun a state of complete exhilaration.
You can make as much argument as you want for machines from other countries, and a person will even accept that argument in principle, but the whole conversation is split from the final phrase, "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people are likely to love not only the technology but all the other Japanese.
Quoting off Bass, fixing the Wasabi food, collecting the catanas, and dressing your girlfriend -- no, not in kimono, of course, but in Japanese street fashion: sweet, creative, and very unexpected.
I think Japanese school uniforms are the only form that girls would love to wear after school.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the looks of CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But the new picture of the headlights and the backlights, by which the car will be instantly recognized in the flow of the car, makes a much greater difference.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the looks are strict.
You don't have to call the police.
In the CX-5 drive, one of the safest in the world, you can only experience stoic Japanese tranquillity.
The diesel engine of 2.2 litre provides a high torque at a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine is 175 litre s. to a total of 5.9 litre. A power train is assembled exclusively by automatic transmission and full drive.
Black boots, black cape, black bag...
To add a bit of black humor to this image, you can select leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
In Mazda, however, they did their best to keep you from driving a CX-5 accident.
To further improve comfort, while maintaining excellent control, the suspension was rebuilt with the design of the front and back amortizers, as well as optimizing the shape of the front lower levers.
The full drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The road and engine noise at high speeds is reduced by 13 per cent.
A cupboard in a flower or strip is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's different if a girl looks in a bathing suit with an original picture.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of a role fighter.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved structure for both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal reserve of space for both the wide shoulder and the long leg, which is what it has.
And the long-legged ones will probably appreciate that the edges in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the expression.
The most extensive set of active security systems, Mazda, is proposed for CX-5.
It uses radars, lasers, and cameras to detect a potential threat.
There's adaptive lighting here, and warnings about the downfall of the strip, and monitoring dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best boots in the class.
Comfortable, with a minimum protrusion, it contains a load of 561 litres. The rear seats shall be set in a ratio of 4:2:4 - each section shall be fitted with a separate drawbar - and shall extend the baggage compartment to 1,560 litres.
The cartoon hero's suit in Japan is called "kigurums".
It's particularly hot-ass pyjamas.
You can do anything in it!
Of course I do.
But also to entertain small children.
Or just walking around like that on the street...
I mean, it's so cool to be able to choose -- cool clothes, behavior, or a car.
Thank you for helping Kawaikat produce the material.
Kyiv tore up the atomic unia.
Kyiv has formalized Ukraine's refusal to cooperate with Russia on the development of the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant.
The Supreme is glad to have voted on Wednesday since the second attempt, however, for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements for the construction of the third and fourth blocs had been signed as early as 2010-2012, but it had not been possible to start the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law to terminate the 2010-2012 agreement with the Russian Federation on the construction of a third and fourth block at the Khmelnitsk NPP.
The bill submitted by the Government had been passed only after the second vote, the first time it had been supported by 210 members, with a minimum of 226, but then 234 members of Parliament had voted in favour of the draft.
In the USSR, the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant was originally to have four units of 1 GW with a WW reactor type, but only two had been built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the extension had led to an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and the Council had passed laws in 2011-2012.
Since there was no budget in Ukraine, it was envisaged that the construction of blocks would have to be borrowed from the Russian side, but the funds had never been made available.
Following the coup in Kyiv in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in the relations of the two countries, Kyiv began to end relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, declaring no cooperation on the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant and on the project to construct a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area in which the relationship remained was the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the country's power generation), since so far the Ukrainian NAEC “Energoat” had nothing to replace Russian supplies.
The plans to complete Khmelnitsky's nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: as early as 2014, talks with the Czech Skoda JS had been announced in Kyiv.
UN Gensec against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated during a press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," the AP's answer to a question about Russian military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also announced that he would meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the UNSC later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, the Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Russian Federation, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, reported that the General Staff did not rule out the possibility of a future airbase in Syria.
There are no plans for this.
"But anything can be," said the Lord Bogdanovsky.
Previously, the U.S. reported that the US did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who claimed that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist group “Islamic State” that had been banned in the Russian Federation.
For more information on US doubts about Russian aid to Syria, see the U.S. "Russia's Military Presence in Syria Worried Washington".
In the PA, the OSCE reports a possible meeting of the Parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Arthur Herasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in south-east Ukraine.
“What I know is that a certain meeting is scheduled this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations,” the TASS quotes Mr. Herasimov.
He also called for the implementation of the mine agreements and “to return to the normal life of our countries”.
On the question of whether, in his view, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the “Normandian” or in the form of a contact group at the OSCE PA site - was currently possible, Mr. Herasimov observed that the dialogue had been held, there were mine agreements.
At the same time, according to the policy, any type of dialogue is being promoted in Kyiv.
Previously, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, the former President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugano Republics had not, in principle, yet had not changed their position in the tripartite talks, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties had been given mandates.
Yesterday, the Bas-Novgorod Electoral Commission summed up the municipal Duma elections, allocating 12 parliamentary mandates on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral irregularities have been made by the representatives of the CPRF, who have been charged with “falsification”.
The opposition ' s comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the group refused to organize a referendum on the lifting of the rent for the renovation of multi-family houses.
The city bar officially presented the results of the election in the proud Bas-Novgorod district.
A total of 1.03 million people had been included in the Bas-Novgorod electoral roll, 746,000 had been issued to the district commissions and 268,000 had voted in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
On the list of the “One Russia” six deputies in the gordum are based on Dmitry Swatkovsky, Dmitri Krasnov, Vasili Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Viacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagor.
The LDWP was given the sole mandate of the party leader, Vladimir Zhirinovski.
The two PRRA mandates are distributed between Vladimir Boulanov and the deputy of the State Duma, Alexander Tarnayev.
The three mandates of “Just Russia” are given to Alexander Reasonovsky, Igor Bogdanov, and Mikhail Shalukin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether or not they will be members of the city's mind: if the mandate is abandoned, he will turn to the next candidate on the list.
The chairman of the oblast committee, Alexander Makeev, informed the members of the commission that he was in the process of putting on duty for a “link of telegrams to Girinovsky and others” in order to give up their mandates.
At the time of the adoption of the protocol on the outcome of the election, the representatives of the CPRF had reported multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutski, a member of the Gymnasium with the right to vote, proposed not to accept the results of the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district had ordered the closure of the entrance to the administration building, where the four district commissions had been located.
Neither the state's deputies, the candidates themselves, nor the observers, had been able to go inside for a long time, and the resonant scandal of storming the doors of the parade had been shown in the air.
All observers and members of the commissions, with the right to vote, had the opportunity to attend the meetings of the district commissions.
It was only when the vote was over and the district commissions had not yet come to deliver their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"The chapter was then corrected, and the interested persons could be present at all the meetings," the member of the mountain bench of Natalia Andrewshin.
The Communists objected to the fact that, in the closed administration building, a member of the Zaputak Assembly of the Region of Ludmile Aristov had been illegally held for more than four hours, on which a complaint had been sent to the investigating committee.
The opposition also resented the fact that in a number of the PICs on the day of the election, they began sealing the urns at 6-7 a.m. by posting the ballot papers for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the commissions, with the right to speak and to observe, had not been notified, so they had already come by the start of the election at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning before the opening of polling stations, ballots could be thrown in unchecked.
However, the mountain tube, which had already dealt with more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeev, found no infractions of the unaccounted for ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from the Fair Russia, Maria Popová, by means of an Circumstance, to come out of the regional legislation to make clear the time of opening the envelopes with the advance ballots, which then enter the urn.
"Go to the CEC as your own initiative," advises Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, Sergey Samahin, a member of the CPRF, had struck the president with high charges, shouting that he was ignoring dozens of complaints and covering forgery in the elections.
"You're not here at the rally, be careful to say it!" the president of the bar was offended.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the bench is to approve the overall results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the City Duma of Lower Novgorod of the Sixth Conference will be scheduled for three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the urban electoral commission refused to register the political party “Communists of Russia” with the initiative group for the holding of a local referendum.
According to the records, the party was going to bring to the lower city two questions: do they agree that the rents for the renovation of multi-family houses should be “immediately abolished” and the rents for housing and public services should be “freeze by 2020”.
However, Irina Maslova, a lawyer of the Duma duma, explained that the application of the Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
The FedEx is mixed, lowering the projections for 2016.
FedEx reported on the disconcerting results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced the forecast of annual returns due to a drop in demand for freight services and an increase in the cost of its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time, FedEx reported last year that he would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares increased by about 2.5 per cent in pre-bid bids 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that he was planning to make between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts presumed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast decreases despite an average 4.9 per cent increase in rates, which will come into effect on 4 January, and an increase in charges for the ground transport of heavy or high-level cargo, which begins in November.
The company stated that it was still planning an increase in revenue from last year, due to lower costs, higher gross income and an increase in online trade.
The Chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, stated that the company “had been stable in view of the weaker economic environment than forecast, particularly in production and world trade”.
Job plans for the holidays were announced the day after the bid of the competitor, UPS, that they plan to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same number as they did last year.
FedEx earned $692 million a quarter later on August 31, an increase of 6 per cent over the previous year.
The share income was $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 for a stakes investment research survey of 12 analysts.
Income rose by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six Analysts interviewed by the Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered from a recession in recent years in the urgent international transport sector, resulting in the absence of an increase in the gross income of its express transport unit.
However, the Internet shopping boom has dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues from land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operating income remained unchanged owing to the increased costs of major shipments and self-insurance.
The express transport unit earned higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, income fell due to higher labour costs.
In the preliminary bids, about an hour before the opening of the exchange, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday by 11 per cent a year and 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
At the most anticipated meeting in a few years, the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from Honduran redwood, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost 10 years.
At one end, a rich decorated meeting room, two floors above it, will hang a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues should place the country ' s economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank received a double call from the Congress: to maximize employment in the US and to keep the price here stable.
But since the Great Recess, the federal system has recognized that there is a third, unwritten mission: financial stability.
And this third commission may be an unknown factor in the almost predicted decision that will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to break off from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show strong growth in the economy, recent upheavals in the global financial markets can keep the already cautious managers of the federal system from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lyndsey M. Piegza, the main brokerage economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait, "she noticed.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself triggers financial market swings.
About half of the economists recently interviewed Bloomberg predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to withstand this, with a key indicator showing only about 30 per cent of the probability of a rapid upturn.
This may lead to a fall in the stock market if the federal system increases the rate, provided that the decision-makers do not soften the blow of the promise that the next increase will not be long.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was prompted by the expectation that the federal system's strategy-makers would stay the bet this week,' said John Lonski, the main economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It would be a surprise if the federal system would raise the stakes at this point in time," he observed.
If the management of the Federal Reserve does so, "we're gonna have to go a long way in approving their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so that they don't panic."
Other experts objected that an increase in the rate might calm the financial markets, as it would remove the uncertainty about how the federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seems to be inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in slow financial tightening, which might prove the strength of the US's recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she was looking forward to raising the stakes this year, despite the claims by the liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although new jobs slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest rate in over seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal system regards as full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And, while inflation continues to fall below the central bank’s target of 2 per cent, the Federal System’s management stated that the key cause was the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the contraction of the labour market,” noted Ian Shepherdson, the main economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world started to shake at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The average Dow Johns index for industrial shares fell by as much as 16% relatively high in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy might slow global growth.
The market has partially regained its position this month, and the Dow Johns index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve System, market resentment further complicates the complex calculation of the duration of the interest rate.
“In the absence of information on what has happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have been twisted up at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior UCLA researcher, Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former member of the Federal Reserve.
Now, he predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a great deal of uncertainty as to the consequences for the American economy, and they have little or no reliable data since the recent events in China,” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal system, nor should it be technically taken into account in making those decisions.
But in fact, the Federal Reserve has become a global financial power.
The Central Bank's influence has been immense in recent years.
A mere hint from the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013 that the Federal Reserve can “defuse” its monetary expansion has caused global market upheavals.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it might be expected that the managers of the Federal Reserve will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other Headquarters banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process, “More art than science”, noted Zachary Carabell, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Geoffrey Lucker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve there have been cases of overreaction to financial market movements that do not seem to be linked to economic principles.”
Lucker, a member with the right to vote of an influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on raising the rate, gave an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian financial crisis has led the Federal System to lower its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three sessions, “despite the limited identifiable impact on US growth,” Laker said.
A year later, the federal system’s managers cancelled the cuts.
The federal reserve system should focus only on concern for stability in times of major crisis, such as the collapse of the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the interest-rate committee at Bank of England.
The last panic didn't get close to that level, he said.
"You certainly wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of the rise in stakes because the markets are shaken," said Pozen, president of the Peterson World Economics Institute.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be ahead of it.
Do you need a good Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/market is open in 1997 and belongs to LAX-C Inc.
It is often called the Thai Costco, the LAX-C, and is a wholesale Thai market, which is also traded for the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Ty Town.
The market/shop is a store that can be bought at once, offering a dizzy selection of fresh, frozen and dried produce, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen items, furniture, religious and public ornaments.
There's even a car department if you need to buy some butter for the engine.
The store is huge, and it's gonna take over an hour to search all the rows.
If shopping causes you to starve, buy food at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cookery department in the store (good and inexpensive) is close to the cashier's office and offers various options for taking out.
What's the offer? Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Prices of goods are reasonable, and a lot of goods are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include delicate Asian and local Thai herbs, fruit, and so on.
The meat bar is diverse, as is the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean up and split the fish, and even fry it for you, if you like.
The fine part of the store is placed under an impressive freezer, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter pumpkin and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and gall, pork carcasses, caviar, local sausage, semi-finished, and so on.
Who buys it: restaurant owners and chefs, and families and individual customers.
There are both shopping carts and forklifts in the wide passage.
New Durian Montong next to the exit.
The store is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, adjacent to the outskirts of the Chinese quarter and the business center of the city, a few blocks from the Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has his own site, which he shares with other stores and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually easy to find.
The Speaker of the State of State, Sergei Narishkin, admits that the US is deliberately destabilizing the Middle East so that the waves of refugees flow to Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this view to the journalists in Ulaanbaatar in the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a promoter of conspiratory theories, but the question is for myself: is Europe the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic perseverance in recent years, have destabilized the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?" he wondered.
"Surely someone thought and knew that the flow of refugees, these poor and destitute people, who are fleeing from death, would rush to the well-off EU countries," he added.
Narishkin asked: “How many political leaders in Europe have spoken out about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is literally flooding their countries?”
"No, old Europe, with a rare exception, prefers to keep quiet," he said.
According to Narishkin, NATO flouts many European values and international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and unbiasedly watched and looks at how the NATO-negotiated military boots are shattering moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and rules of international law,” the speaker stressed.
Government forces and their loyal paramilitaries are opposed by rebels, who are mostly Islamist.
Later, the terrorist group “Islamic State”, which had been banned in Russia, joined the Syrian Government's opponents.
The US supports the rebels, who are opposing both Assad and IG.
Official Damascus regards such rebels as terrorists.
Syria’s president described the cause of the West’s aversion to Russia.
The Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia, and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, Channel I, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners or sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and place another in his place, who would act in the interest of Western countries rather than in the interest of his country, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of Western media in the wake of the coup d'état in Ukraine.
For them, he said, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had “became from a Western friend to an enemy, a king, a dictator, who suppressed the Russian opposition, which had come to power in an undemocratic way, even though he had been elected as a result of the democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad in the fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West’s constant statement that Assad himself should go, he noted that the president came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he left, at the request of the people, not at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference, or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, or else he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation was being pursued with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Referring to Iran's military support, the Syrian leader observed that the country supported the Syrian State in the political, economic and military fields.
He denied the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Teheran is supplying us with military equipment.
“There is, of course, an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place,” he explained.
As far as the rest of the States are concerned, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Igilov coalition led by the United States,” Al-Assad pointed out.
The number of deaths was over 230,000, and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
A part of the territory was seized by a terrorist group, the Islamic State, which was banned in Russia.
An international coalition led by the United States is launching air strikes at the IG positions.
In Utah, 12 people died from flooding.
In the U.S. state of Utah, at least 12 people died as a result of flooding.
Another is reported missing, passing Fox 13 Salt Lake City.
The water washed off a number of cars with the people in Washington County.
One of them, the van where the family was, stopped in a dangerous zone near the water, and the stream suddenly overtaken it.
The youngest of the victims was four years old.
All of the dead are in the Colorado City and Hildale districts, which have been hit by the storm.
Three children who have been rescued have also been reported.
There are 650 teams involved in search and rescue.
CSKA lost to Wolfsburg in the League of Champions' start-up match: football: Sports: Lenta.ru

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
US Secretary of State John Kerry had a telephone conversation with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov.
Reuters reports this with a reference to John Kirby, a representative of the State Department.
It is noted that the subject of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
Kirby did not, however, provide any further details.
At the same time, he said that the US had the tools for “further isolation of Russia” if it supported Syrian president Bashar Assad, it would send the RIA News.
According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a conversation with Kerry, Lavrov re-emphasized the need to create a united front against terrorist groups operating in that country.
Discussions were also held on how to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, and on possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were raised.
United States officials had previously stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria, and had expressed concern about the strengthening of Moscow's support for Assad.
In Washington, they said that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, President Dmitri Peskov of Russia's press secretary said that the country would not be in international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of the overthrow of the Assad regime.
A part of the territory was seized by the terrorist organization Islamic State.
An international coalition led by the US is subject to air strikes by IG positions.
The beard called the American newspaper's information a libel against the Arrow.
The former president of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Boroda, denied the information that had been published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He announced this in a telephone interview to the correspondent of Lenta.ru.
The note at the Washington Post is beautiful because it's totally overturned.
The former Minister of Defence of the DPRD, Igor Smallkov, of course, had not been linked and he had "exited" from the territory of the Republics of Donbass in a very uplifted mood, with no ropes, no three furs of money attributed to him by different characters," he noted.
According to Beroday, the conversation about the shooter with the reporter of the American newspaper was really going on.
"Yes, I said that it was an urgent need to remove from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of government of the DNR.
The beard stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the United States magazine had decided to write that the shooters had been taken to Russia “linked”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it's not a provocation, it's a surprisingly misunderstood word, because I stressed that the shooters had left themselves,' remarked the Beard.
"This is a slander against both me and the Sniper," he concluded.
A previous article on the pages of The Washington Post included the words of Berothai that he had forcibly taken Sholkov to Russia.
According to the newspaper, Bearda said that he had to bind his partner.
The Polish authorities have begun to search for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
Polish loggers have begun to cut down trees over an underground tunnel, where, according to some data, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, 15 September, according to Reuters.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to test the veracity of the rumours about the trains with treasures.
Armaments and precious minerals can be found inside the train.
On August 31, the Polish voivodeship governor Tomás Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz) suggested that new evidence of a gold train was no more convincing than the previous one.
However, the authorities decided to block the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland's Deputy Minister of Culture, Peter Zhukhowski, stated that local treasure-searchers had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is described in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the State Treasury, and the treasure will not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm approached the Polish city of Walbjikh with a report that they had found a train in a closed tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The main drugologist of the Russian Federation proposed that the sale of tobacco to persons under the age of 21 should be prohibited.
Russia’s main drugologist proposed that the sale of tobacco be banned until the age of 21.
Yevgeny Brune noted that until that age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - is particularly harmful."
So he said live on the radio station "The Voice of Moscow", commenting on the fact that the Speaker of Sovfed Valentine Matvienko had supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21.
Man's growing up is not the same.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, and you're physically ready for it.
Psychically, he's ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
"We know from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, is only fully ripened by 21", observed Breen.
Previously, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the “Treasure Russia” project, Sultan Hamzaev, told the News that Matvienko had supported the initiative to raise the age of alcohol and “agreed to raise the issue again with the Public Chamber at the site of the upper House of Parliament”.
According to the activist, a working group will soon be set up in the Federation Council to draft a bill under the leadership of Matvieenko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the Law on the Information Protection of Children
A resident of Novosibirsk requested the Regional Prosecutor's Office to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law “On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development”, a statement was made on 16 September by the correspondent Sib.fm.
The author stated that on 26 August 2015 he had purchased a Bible at the Chitai City store in the Red Prospect, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his view, violated the FZ “On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development”.
On 16 September, the application was accepted by the Prosecutor ' s Office in Novosibirsk.
The response to the address of the resident of Novosibirsk will take place within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
Much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, the complainant commented to Correspondent Sib.fm.
And it's a very solid problem that's going to engender a society.
It will begin to reread the Bible, which it had not done before.
The Brazilian Union of Paediatrics of Rio Grande promotes healthy diet for breast-feeders
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method that is intended to convince women of the need for proper nutrition during breast-feeding: the method is to show images of infants sucking breasts that are painted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
In view of the high energy needs of pregnant and pregnant women, it is recommended that the daily calorie rate be increased by about 500 calories per day.
A recent study, however, shows that one increase in calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affect the expression of genes in children and prevent them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy diet on the child ' s immune system was found.
Under Hamburg, the train hit a school bus.
A train crashed into a school bus in the vicinity of Hamburg, which was stuck on the railroad.
A 23-year-old woman driver, realizing that she could not move off the rails, ordered 60 pupils to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a collision in front of them.
He was videotaped by a student.
The emergency caused a panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the side of the road.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was harmed by a miracle except one train passenger who was slightly injured.
The damage from the accident was estimated at Euro300,000.
Doctors call for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown, Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a fight with the Filipino Carlo Magali.
The International Boxing Federation (IBF)'s regional titles in the weight category of up to 57.15 kg, which lasted on Friday, ended with Magali's victory in the 12th round.
Brown was in the hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life support device.
Brown won 22 victories in the professional ring, suffered only two defeats, and one fight ended in the face.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second death rate among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died of injuries in the ring.
The AMA now recommends that it should not be involved in this sport, but rather that it should, in its view, be prohibited at all.
I know this is happening unintentionally,' said the vice president of the organization, Stephen Pairnis.
But in the way that boxing is now, there will always be situations where an athlete gets a haemorrhage or brain injury, leading to either death or severe damage.
For that reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to lift the sanctions against Russian Parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Sergey Narishkin, said that the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians was unacceptable.
He said that at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is an expression of political shame and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue,” said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to re-establish the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get morals back to politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to international communication.
Let us restore humanist ideals to a democratic world order.
"Doubleness never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the podium of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and to immediately convene our inter-parliamentary group,” Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
"This is almost the only common ground that still discusses how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," stressed the politician.
We recall that the fall session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar, and will last until 18 September.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple or three days.
He is the world champion of the Sergey Schubenkov Light Athletics.
This season is a triumphant one for a 24-year-old light-baller from Barnaul Sergey SCHUBENKOVA.
He was able to win 110 meters at his crown, with the barriers to European command, to set a number of records, and, above all, to become the world's champion, the first in the history of a domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Brilliant League, taking the third place in total.
"The New News" asked Schubenkov to share the impressions of the coming season.
Sergei, is the season not over for you?
Yeah, I'm gonna go to the World War, which is gonna be in Korea in October, and then I'm gonna think about resting.
True, I'm going to be at home in Barnaul right now, and being at home is still a different state.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said that the fall was your favorite time of the year.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a great time.
The passions after the main start of the season are overwhelmed, and the burden of responsibility is no longer strained.
You can have fun at relaxing.
Plus, you know, the vacation's very soon...
Are you tired?
Still, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Tired by the end of the season is always accumulating.
And it doesn't matter what I did more - win or lose.
Every competition is stress.
Flying, moving, it doesn't go unnoticed for the body.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But right now, I'm feeling a lot of emotion.
What's the matter? I'm just happy!
By the time you finished the Beijing World Cup, do you come back a lot?
It happens.
And you journalists keep me from forgetting it.
But in fact, I think it's bad for a sporter who lives old victories to run his successful race over and over again.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple or three days, and we have to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can't say there was something special.
We started getting ready in December, but I missed the winter season.
Trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the prep, then at home again.
It's the usual.
But with the coach, the challenge was to try to get to a new level I haven't been to.
Almost all winter time was spent setting up a base.
We ran through a lot of sneakers, we did all sorts of physical training, which included both traction and seating, and we rolled our backs.
And then they went to the barricade training, and they did a lot of tech.
The way the rivals are acting, you've been watching?
I'm always trying to do that, and there's no problem with it in the Internet age.
I watched the European Winter Cup, and there the French took over the pedestal in the barrier.
I thought I'd do something, dilute the company.
With each start this season, you've added and added to the results.
Did it give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons coming up in a sort of the same way.
It's not like I run 13.20 and then 13.50.
I'm always spinning my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused on this result.
But the paradox is, you kind of feel like you're ready to do the work, and the competitions don't always show up.
How was it, for example, at the London Olympics?
I, to be honest, that semi-final race.
It was really good, actually running out of 13 seconds.
Even if I had repeated my best score at the time, I'd have become a bronze player in the game.
But bad luck.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
What about it?
It was in Tagu.
I really wanted to get into the finals at the time, it was a program-maximum.
And fell right off in the morning, in the pre-race race.
That's when I realized that torn and tore my head apart means not to run anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the Moscow World Cup, he entered the finals with the best time.
I remember very well how I felt before the final race: I really wanted to win the gold at the time!
How is it possible to keep your head up, keep your head down, keep your head down?
And that's the hardest part.
You need to be very careful, focus on technology, so you don't break the barriers.
I noticed that it's a lot easier when you focus on the process rather than the result.
It's the best thing to do when you get the feeling you're running and it's like you're doing it!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the interior, after their first major successes, are trying to move closer to the capital.
You've never had that kind of thought?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I am without my coach, who needs me?
It might be good to have a better deal, but I'm trying to be content with what I have.
How long have you two been together?
Ever since I was 12 years old, since I went to athletic.
Well, first I was training with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, and then I jumped in length, tripled.
The children's multi-war was when the ball was thrown, jumping from place to place...
At 14, he tried running with the walls, and I loved it.
From the first race, it was possible to meet the second-class norm.
I'm still here.
There's never been any fear of the barriers?
One day, I got a deal with them.
But there's always been a lot of work on technology.
There's one race that I've been through!
But this routine doesn't go anywhere.
The tech needs to get up all the time - so that I can wake up at night, I get up right away and run over the barriers.
All those who have seen your race in Beijing claim it was a very beautiful race.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
Normally, I don't rethink my races, and I can't help it.
But we need to keep working on efficiency - there's no limit to perfection.
Don't you fear that a win a year before the Olympics will be on your shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
If you choose this road, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you don't have to feel any extra load.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive that I'm amazed at the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I know. Don't feed them with bread. Give them a lift.
And even though I didn't fly the flag, and the same thing, exactly the same thing, I've said a million times here, and I didn't call anyone a bastard directly, another thing hit me.
All my pseudo-friends were in a moment, and they'd vanished in a second.
The pressing I'm experiencing is so strong that even I, when I've seen the kind of kid, think people are full of whites.
It was like walking, walking, and you're being attacked by a crowd, and you're gonna have to put your hands on it.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, old man, I'm afraid.
The other thing is, there's no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best thing about me was self-sufficiency, so bite it.
And giving passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson can only be idiots.
I wish I, the best journalist, was a shameful job.
A week ago, in Kyiv, Othar Kushanashvili remarked criminal events:
What they did to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I believe that the reference to the way the drunk Khrushchev was trying to sign something doesn't fit in with the general picture of the human community.
It's like coming to the neighbor and picking up his apartment...
The war from the Kremlin went off, and it's only gonna end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like the summer of 2008, it started with a call from some bastard from the Kremlin's cell.
I have any idea who it might be...
Cobzone doesn't have much to live on.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, he was demolished.
Of course, people remember him as an affront to their small homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seven is in the lead in the rating despite the efforts of the Ninth to highlight the loss of the leaders in the Today Show
Carl Stephanowicz and Lisa Wilkinson's trip to Canberra to cover the implications of the Liberal Party's announcement to vacate the leader's seat was not able to boost the Today ratings very much.
The 9th morning show was aired from the state capital after Malcolm Turnbull's defeat of Tony Abbott.
The rival, Sunrise, with the leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is trapped in London in a week-long series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
The length of the torture did not seem to have been of great importance to the Australian viewers, with the Sunrise audience of 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities, compared to the Today audience of 339,000.
Today scored a little more than its ratings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but the figure was lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers in September, compared to 314,000 in Today.
This is the most interesting thing that's been happening all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the update!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015.
The big news for Seven was the amazing 800 Words debut with the former star of Packed to the Rafters, Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the newly widowed father of the family, who decided to move to New Zealand with his two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics reasoned whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without Rafters' star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is the loud answer "yes."
The X Factor Seven remained strong with a audience of 1.136 million viewers, bypassing the Block (838,000) and the TBL Family (726,000).
For the seventh, luck and failure on the second evening of the Chase Australia combined.
The first half an hour (from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m. 30 p.m.) of the new TV show, led by Andrew O'Keefi, gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 5.30 p.m. to 6 p.m.), the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over the Hot Seat by Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 viewers, and the second half of it was overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The drop in the Chase Australia ratings for the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to replay the McGuire show.
Originally published as "Sunrise leads, while Today stays at the local level."
The three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret's out? ...
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snow Marcoski may have accidentally revealed which of them will win the "Blood."
The woman who's gonna end up with Sam Wood in "The Bachelor" is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who got to the finale, of course, keep quiet about which one of them got his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow Marcoski, and Lana Jevons-Fellows the day before the three girls had to stay, they might have accidentally tipped off the winner.
Sam Wood stays silent until the finale on Thursday.
All three women come in a lyric mood, telling me why Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, purpose, family values, joy as a reason why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, by answering the question, "If not you, who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could unwittingly tell us which one of them had actually conquered the heart of "The Bachelor."
Jevons-Fellows and Marcoski were sure to call McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship since day one.
"From the moment I was a member, I felt the energy (Sarah) and the energy of Sam, and I realized that they were very good for each other, and I didn't doubt it all along," said Jevons-Fellows.
"Sara is a very open man, with her easy and fun," added Marcoski.
I saw them together, and there's a real attraction between them.
They feel good and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks that she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
MacKay herself said that thanks to her home dating last week, she realized that Wood might be "the very person."
"The moment I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was definitely not just a game -- I believed him with all my heart," she said.
To the question of whom to choose voodoo, if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same, and Snow and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor shows on Wednesdays at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarrid Hein had a number of options to start his career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle had a lot of interest in him since he moved to the United States, as well as a lot of other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hain chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems to have been a wise choice.
Some coaches would have left Hain on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian rugby League player allowed on the first return of the pant in a win-win game with Minnesota, with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hein another chance to get back the pant, as well as to use it in the game after the injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed up on the good side after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of dispersing the newcomers in front of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hain at a press conference after the match.
Special reporter for Club 49ers Cam Inman reported that Hein also received support from Thomas McGoy's Special Team Coordinator, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jarrid Hain lost the ball on the return of the pant by the Minnesota Waikings team during the first quarter.
For this start of the NHL debut, Hain and his many Australian fans clearly did not expect it.
You can see Hain swearing off the field after he lost the ball, and he later told the host of the show "Hames and Andy" at radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he had no idea of a more bad start for a career in the NFL.
"This happens, you're just thinking about the next game and that's all," said Hain.
Hein compared his debut with the 2007 Origin series of games, when the ball was thrown in his credit zone and tried Queensland.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hein took a picture of the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the picture to Instagram.
Elton John and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under the threat of the use of weapons at the airport in Siberia.
Openly defying President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to promote democracy were halted.
At the border of Hungary, there have been clashes between migrants and the police.
The refugees protested at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Resque, which grew into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water wells and tear gas, handing over the Reuters.
Migrants stoned the police and tried to tear down the border fence.
Back-up has been sent to the scene, and the police have responded to the acts of aggression by migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungarian territory.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports BBC.
The authorities had allowed migrants to arrive in Croatian territory and to transport them from there to the right country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers had been injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament tightened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the involvement of the army in the protection of State borders, the criminal prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and the prompt processing of asylum requests.
The Hungarian court had already found one migrant guilty of illegal crossing the Hungarian-Serb border, and he would therefore be deported and would not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament is also about to consider the transfer of border security functions to the Hungarian Armed Forces.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began constructing a barbed wire fence with a length of 175 km on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russian confessed to committing the largest cyberattack in US history.
An accused of the largest cyberattack in United States history, a Russian man, Vladimir Drinkman, confessed to the theft of over 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial before the Federal Court of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to collusion in order to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, a Russian spoke of a collusion with three Russians and a Ukrainian citizen who had been accused of cyberattacking 15 companies.
The total loss from the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
“Such defendants as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, our privacy and our national security,” states U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman faces 30 years' imprisonment, and a fine of a million dollars.
When sentencing, the court will take account of the Russian ' s confession and may shorten it.
Drinkman's sentence will be pronounced on January 15th.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitri Smilnets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt for the crimes he is charged with.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russia's support of the Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry, warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risked exacerbating and exacerbating the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” states a report published on the U.S. State Department's website.
Kerry confirmed the US's commitment to the fight against the Islamic State (which is banned by the Supreme Court in Russia) in a coalition of over 60 States.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad “can never be a reliable member” of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved by a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of support for the Assad regime.
On the day before, the White House Press Secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation, unless it stopped supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the “Islamic State”.
In recent times, the media have often reported the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
To which the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, claimed that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and were helping the Syrians to master the technology to use it against Islamists.
Four people died when the police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police started shooting rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new Constitution, as the official announced on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at a police station, some throwing stones and arson bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, then shot in the air before putting rubber bullets in motion.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last in a few weeks of violent protests in southern, lowland Nepal, where members of the Madesi people claim that the new provinces under the new constitution will diminish their political influence.
Protests have also taken place in the west of Nepal, among the Tararu people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally managed for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been under way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
The legislators voted in favour of articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk is planning to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk.
It was built in the 1970s as a center of the chemical industry, with a well-developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk led the new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
He presented the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects to the correspondent, Regional.
Oleg Valeryvich, how did you start your job as mayor?
I first read the results of the financial and business audits, and initiated an independent audit of the local budget.
The municipal property was then audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the volume of documentation to five days.
Previously, the papers could go through the courts for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the income base and to optimize costs.
Last November, a Government retreat was held in Sayansk to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
The city did not have any design and design documentation (PPS) for any site.
Without that, Sayansk could not take part in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of POJA for roads, day care, a northern sewer and a water reservoir.
Roadworks are already under way on two sites.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Saiyansk.
This positive demography has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in day care is one of the most urgent today.
Since 1 September, it has closed down for the major maintenance of kindergarten No. 10, which is designed for 320 places.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million roubles.
So far, the city has never received such funds.
Last year, a day care centre No. 23 was opened, and 200 children are currently attending.
The repairs were co-financed from the regional and local budgets, costing more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the Regional Government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment have been raised, and the People's Initiatives programme has also been helped.
There are plans to start the construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the rank of children between the ages of one and a half and three.
We don't have 3 to 7-year-olds.
Are investors interested in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city is to be carried out, first and foremost, by the Sayans, and that it is to be provided with work.
As early as October, a 60-family home for orphaned children in the Leningrad district is in operation.
As far as construction is concerned, Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, which has become part of the economic-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing for those who want to participate in the programme.
One condition is that the dwelling must not be more than 30,000 roubles per square metre, and this cost includes a “keywork”.
If we can handle the set volumes, we can continue to participate in the programme.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
In time, the Sayan Pork Complex was built in the Territory, which was sold at no cost in 2004.
We're working with the D.A. to protest this deal.
Especially since the land under the target is in federal property.
Work is under way with Moscow, and the transfer of 88 hectares to the district property is under way, and the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is ready to invest 1.5 billion roubles in the reconstruction and start-up of the project.
We'll have 900 jobs when the pig is released, which will be a big help to the city.
Is there a social partnership institution in Saiyansk?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership treaties.
A large number of projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Enterprises such as the East Centre WOO, the Novo-Zimian TEQ, the Saiyan Broyler OOO, the MDF PKO provide tangible support, and the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
Directly in the day of the OLG, the Sayan Broyler gave the city a town of children, and East Centre renovated the horseyard, where professionals were involved in the treatment of children with more than 1 million rubles.
Sponsored funds have enabled the city's register to be rebuilt.
Sponsors helped celebrate City Day in a colorful way.
As in the old days, a parade took place with the participation of the city's collectives and organizations.
The history of the city, a book of Saiyan poets, was published.
The first builders and the people who have made a significant contribution to the development of Sayansk have been given the Jubilee Medals.
The Mecents also participate in the City Charitable Foundation.
The first step was to buy tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 roubles have been designed to support talented children, help children in need of expensive treatment, and support children from low-income families.
How are human resources problems in the social sphere being addressed in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of medical and pedagogical professionals in the city.
The provision of housing for professionals is essential to address the human resource issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have been provided with a service home.
We have a housing programme that can be privatized in five years.
Plans are to restructure the building, which will have eight more flats for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the programme "Life for the Russian Family".
In the long run, the building of a home for budget professionals.
The most important thing is that the city has a working team with which I can deal with the most complex issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma has introduced a bill on the indexation of sociales, taking into account the rise in prices.
A bill has been submitted to the State Duma to index social pensions annually since 1 February, taking into account the rise in prices.
The author of the document, Alexander Lomakin-Rumiants, a member of the Fair Russia, also proposes an additional indexation of pensions on 1 April, if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum is higher than the rate of increase in the prices of goods and services.
Indications of social benefits under the current legislation are made annually from 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth of the minimum subsistence level of the pensioner in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law submitted to the lower house provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the rate of growth in consumer prices.
The first indexation is rescheduled to 1 February and the second is held on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA has told Mogerini that it is not possible to impose sanctions on parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogerini, the Speaker of the OSCE PA, Ilka Kanerva, declared that no sanctions should be imposed on the legislators participating in the assembly.
A member of the Russian delegation to the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar, Nikolai Kovalev, informed the press.
According to TASS, the signatures of European Parliamentarians, including the representatives of Cyprus, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, have been collected in support of the Canerva position.
"A strong enough support has already developed," said Kovalev.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had intended to collect the signatures of the deputies, who had indicated that no sanctions against parliamentarians should be imposed.
In particular, Kovalev noted that Kanerva had promised to raise the issue to the level of EU leadership and to “send the relevant petition”.
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Cape is 60%.
The wide front of the low-pressure area is about 350 miles (560 km) south of the south end of the Green Cape Islands, with a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday by the United States National Hurricane Center.
Another well-defined low-pressure area in the middle between the Green Cape and the Small Antillean Islands is also 60 per cent likely to develop a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports synoptics from Miami.
Google is launching a double-dollar campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOGL.O) announced the launch of a double-gathering campaign to collect $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help flooding European refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has taken an uncharacterized personal approach by announcing a fund-raising campaign on his blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the supervisors, Google employee Rita Masoud, who ran away with her family from Kabul when she was seven, described her personal experience.
"We've been on dubious trains and buses, we've been starved, thirsty, cold, and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations dealing with refugees and migrants: Médecins sans frontières, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google announced that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the sum on Google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, most of which was caused by a four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.

Diabetes with small obesity can be helped by obesity surgery
The good effect of obesity surgery in people with small obesity, type 2 diabetes, can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with small obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive nonsurgery.
"Death statistics don't show at all immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the column of the JAMA Surgery editor.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organizations to absorb food.
In a few years, bariatric surgery has proved to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the main studies have been carried out among people with morbid obesity, with an index of body mass (IMT) 35 or more.
The IMT, the weight measure relative to growth, is considered normal at 18.5 to 24.9.
The IMT 25 or more indicates that a person is overweight, and people with IMTs over 30 are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare the two types of bariatric surgery - bypassing the stomach and the sleeve gastroectomy, with type 2 diabetes treatment for people with low obesity.
The average value of M & A for those who have been subjected to surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, those who have received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remain at about 29.
Among those who had undergone the surgery, 36 per cent had been completely cured of diabetes, and 28 per cent had been partially cured.
In the group that received medicinal treatment, for comparison, only 1 per cent had complete cure of diabetes, and only about 2 per cent had partial cures.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LPNP cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors claim.
Researchers also controlled the levels of hemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflect the levels of blood sugar in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is best held below 7%, by researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin level of A1c declined from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But the best Glycemic control, as reflected by the good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Chang Soo, research manager, and colleagues.
The Study Group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg as opposed to 14.2 kg) compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, lowered MMT (7.4 as against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent as against 2.1 per cent), and was closer to the full remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent as against 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not show the benefits of a surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to an increase in life expectancy, as Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona, reports.
According to a Swedish study for obesity who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this is encouraging people with IMTs below 35 who are interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here, as it states that such surgery is safe in a group with low IMTs, where there is no higher risk of death or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient's IMT reaches between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to make people take it seriously," she said.
I think it's very hard to reverse the genetic changes that lead to obesity and diabetes in their bodies.
In the Washhouses, the robbers removed the fur coats and 9 million roubles.
In the Washhouses, the robbers attacked the residents of the Moscow House and stole 9 million rubles and three women's coats.
Interfax informs the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown men entered the house on Gorski Street through the open door, tied up the 20-year-old son of the housekeeper and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million roubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9,265,000 roubles, and a criminal case was brought under the heading “Rules”.
European fans risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to obtain permission.
According to experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to world supremacy, the authorities will have to find a way to displace all the city's guests.
The interviewers of Rosbalt believe that the tournament will result in an overpayment of rent to tenants of between 10 and 30 per cent.
The World Cup made the authorities pay attention to the condition of the Russian hotels.
By law, which is written specifically for the first place, every hotel in St. Petersburg must pass the classification procedure and prove that it is in line with the declared number of stars and the level of service.
Even now, it is clear that not all will be able to do so: hotels are so afraid of testing that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Petersburg.
According to UFA head Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has studied 138 hotels and is now planning to start 34 hotels, many of which have simply failed to respond to the anti-monoperators.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies has been deceiving the citizens by placing a number of stars in the ads, noting the Vladimirs.
The problem is, right now, literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, the fans will be occupying all the hotels in Peterburg.
In the city, tourists can count on 30,000 rooms.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, and 550 single-star hotels.
According to the First Deputy Committee for the Development of Tourism, only 23 hotels have so far been classified, so many checks have been made by companies accredited to Petersburg.
Whether a hotel ordered a similar procedure from regional enterprises is not known in a surprising way.
I mean, there may be more classified, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months of hotels did not really want to be classified," acknowledged the Director of the Northwest Office of the Russian Union of the Touring Industry, Catherine Shadsky.
This is due to the high season, during which hotels make the most money and do not want to do other business.
Another reason is the budgets that did not have the cost of testing, and the procedure may be used by the hotel, depending on the status of 30 to 100,000 roubles or more.
However, the hotel managers had recently intensified and started to apply for classification, assured Shadsky.
Hotels have to make it by July 1, 2016, or they will not only pay the fine, but will not be allowed to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the starry, a fixed hotel fee will be developed for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas for which the cost is to be calculated will be publicized next year.
This is done to prevent the price of 200-300% rise, as is the case, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience, and you don't want a promotion to be two or three times, but hotels need to be made.
"I think it'll be up to 50%," explained the president of the Russian Hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure that price fixing is consistent with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much it fits into economic theory, but I hope it's justifiable.
"It's better than unbridled travel," he said.
It's not clear what's going to happen to popular cheap hostels.
Members of the State had submitted a bill to the effect that hostels should be prohibited in homes.
It is to be hoped that this law will not be passed or will not be applied to Petersburg.
"We will advocate the view that hostels must be preserved," Nana Gavácia believes.
However, according to her, the owners of the mini-hotels should in any event be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State does approve the bill, some 80 per cent of the hostels will be closed in St. Petersburg, and there are currently 1,500 rooms.
According to the president of the Federation of Rectors and Hotels of the Northwest, Leonid Garbar, there is a lack of two or three-star hotels in St.
This situation is similar to that of "the 80-thousand stadium has 75,000 vips."
This can be fixed at the expense of mini-hotels.
Their possible ban, the expert says, "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, but some people don't."
If the hostel is used as a dorm, I agree it's wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where the guests come for a short time, why not?
Mini-hospitals risk skipping the World Cup because of their slowness.
Hundreds of small hotels just won't be able to get classed, and they dig a hole for themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be booked.
“Companys that can perform this procedure are not many, so they will give up less paid orders from the mini-hotel, but will choose the ones that are more expensive,” observed Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the rate of the inspections that have been carried out is at present much higher than that of the Peterburg.
The reason for the Paterburg delay is due, inter alia, to the constant shifts in the Government's tourism unit, which is not conducive to a smooth operation.
According to experts, if the hotels in the Netherlands are not enough, it is likely that attention will have to be paid to the regional hotels and rest homes.
Like the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, a river fleet can be mobilized in the city, i.e. the guests of the tournament can live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will be ready to arrive in vans where they can sleep.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels to be empty," I'm sure Gennady Lamshin.
There will also be a lot of popularity during the football title of the leased home.
It's likely that the city will create a reserve of rented flats.
The rent will rise by 10-30%.
"Of the obvious, the first to go home near the stadium," said a specialist in the renting of the Development and Real Estate Research Agency, Larissa Bragin.
And the rent may not return to the same level after the championship, especially in the dormitory.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Let us not forget the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbart is convinced that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people are not just telling the way, but can also conduct a mini-excursion.
There are complications.
My father met a family from Murmansk in 1970, a father, a mother, and two children.
They didn't have a place to sleep. The hotels weren't easy. It was hard to sleep at the station.
"And my dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," he remembered.
True, he added that there is no such thing left in the city at this time - calling his home can have consequences and horrors.
But in 2018, after the failure of the State's decisions, the mistakes of the hotels and the governments, maybe we'll have to remember the past.
Girinovsky's "sille" of the Amur region.
I was fascinated to watch Girinowski's clown in the State.
He did things like that when our generation was just learning how to trade in newspapers, and it's still in perfect shape.
The theme of the speech is, like, "LDP protest against the results of the elections in the district of Amur."
The protocols do not shake - for nothing; there are no protocols other than those signed by the berms, apparently the LDPR.
Here he picks up Ivan Abramov's second place and yells like, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And then it's all over Rodnine, and then, after a fight with the president, it takes the faction out of the courtroom, screaming literally, "You're all with the fronts of your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abramov, but on the faction's scandal and demarcation as a result of this scandal and insult.
In fact, Wolfowicz spilled the Amur region in a beautiful and elegant way, along with Abramov.
For the whole country, it's another "fucking-up" gyirinovsky act, not a protest by a political party against the results of a specific election.
Both the faction formally scanned, and the elections, according to the party's website and Facebook of Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader of the subject is evidently getting down.
Offers to the dead in Amura to bury their dead themselves, while he himself speaks the good news against the One of Russia in general and an innocent Rodnina.
It's a delightful decision not to lose a face, not a real scandal.
The other thing is that now Abraham himself is in a strange situation.
He didn't wait for anything but his boss's screams, and there's no alternative protocol in his hands.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, for a narrow circle, he is the formal reason for insulting a respected champ, and, even more, the hamish of the EP and the UNF.
And here, of course, he needs to think really hard about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, region number two, and candidate number one for the only district single-member district, it can turn into a couple that has been successfully fed up with their own party leadership and super-insurgency for the same UNF and the party leadership of a foreigner.
I'm sure it wouldn't have been Girinovsky, but it should have been made up, and it should have been watched respectfully.
The trumpet is still growing and growing to it.
The news is that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next prisoner.
So the bath fell out of nowhere.
The subject of Abram was, of course, buried under him.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama referred to the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre of Compassion in Oxford, devoted to ethics studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, under the current circumstances, the interests of mankind should be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while it was admirable, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is fine, but at the same time you must also think about durable solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force had never solved those problems," he added.
Referring to violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the US’s strong reaction had led to a chain of unsupervised events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to the problem was possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences,' said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed disinfectant hands over the past 4 years
The United States toxicology centres have reported an almost 400 per cent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who have swallowed high-alcohol disinfectant hands, according to the Georgia State Toxicology Centre.
According to Dr. Gailord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Centre, the cases of children who have swallowed up to 12 years of age hand-disinfected liquids reported to the toxicology centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are in contact with these substances more often, and, unfortunately, some of them go to the E.R.,” Lopez CNN said.
He said that some children drink disinfectant liquid on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends, or to dispute for social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquids as cheap drinks.
Youngsters reportedly mixing disinfectant liquid with alcohol-containing lipwash in order to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the good smells of disinfectant liquid.
"The baby doesn't think it's gonna hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand disinfectant) are those that are scented.
There are disinfectant hands that smell strawberries, grapes, oranges that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant contains about 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In small children, especially, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is a high-concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, Chief Doctor of the Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't just leave a shot of whiskey, but people keep this disinfectant for their hands, and if the kids get to it, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently swallowed a disinfectant hand with a strawberry scent of about four sprays at school, was sent to the E.R. for treatment.
She had 179 alcohol levels in her blood, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija confused her words and was unable to walk when she was taken to the E.R.
Doctors watched her all night at a separate children's clinic to keep out any signs of brain damage, as the girl fell and hit her head, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
It might well have been fatal to my baby.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-pirate or disinfectant napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant hand fluids from the child ' s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant liquids are linked to death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, and not ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three four-year-olds in North New York conspired to poison their “opposing” teacher by “distributing anti-bakterial substances in the class,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to arm disinfectors, and she's not allowed to keep them in her class.
The police consider the failed plan to be "empty talk" and address discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the extreme children's library of N.K. Kruski is saddened by the iron owl.
Kids who come for books are trying to feed her candy.
For a number of generations, he's been in the library for 95 years.
The first readers in the 20th century used to make a big read here, perform on the poems of Mayakovsky, perform a literary quiz, and write to Lenin's wife.
The census lasted four years, and, as The Young Staliner wrote in 1939, “the friendship between the hope of Constantine Kruppskaya and the friends of the Barnaul Children's Library was getting stronger every day.
The hope of Constantine even sent out a picture of her child to her distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnauls asked if Hope Constantinovin had any objection to the library's naming her name, he said no, no.
Letters have been dusted in the museum for a long time, and the grandchildren of the first readers have to explain to them whose strict profile decorates the library.
During the years of restructuring, a number of people called, resented: Why is the children’s library not being renamed?
Let's have a library of the name of a good kid's novelist, no political color!
The staff of the library sat down, thought, and decided to leave it as it was.
"Crumb" is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as a "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a track of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oli Moscow.
Olya used to be the manager of the law firm, came to work at 8:00, left at 5:00, and all the other managers were different from the love of painting.
And then I found an ad on the Internet, "I need an imager for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" -- "My mom has cancer."
Olya made the illustrations, and thought, life can end at any moment, and there will be no wonders in it if you don't create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, she's illustrating the children's books of writers all over the world, and she's making up fairy tales.
Traditionally, it is believed that children are losing interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we have kids who are reading, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, "The Russian Planet," says the director of the library Tatiana Kushvid.
In recent years, we've even had a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and it's going to live - the kids are coming!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
There's a big, up-to-date photography display in the library lobby.
Once a quarter, new photographs of readers who go to the library as a family are posted: Mom, Dad, and the children.
The library is glad to see that more and more popes have come with their children.
At the age of two, the child needs more books when he or she is older.
But there is a law in force that prevents an eight-year-old from issuing 12+ books.
To get a book like this, a kid has to bring his parents - they come, they come back again, and gradually "Crumb" becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library - a pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and eras, to present Coronenko in an annex to the Niwa magazine, a 1936 "Murzylki" embroidery.
We're not just the conceptual space of the book's temple, we're open to movement, we're trying to become a special place: not home, not work, not school, Tatiana Kuszvid.
You can come to us to read, play, paint.
We've made a playground for the babies - the baby just comes to play, and the hand is still reaching for the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they are stifling with their feet, and they don't want to leave.
Moms often come in with carts, and we're glad that they put the library at the top of all the other places to go with the baby's.
Tatiana Kuszvid says that modern children, like us, love classical children's literature:
"The publishing business is under way, and a lot of attention is being paid to the authors, who are the inter-generational link."
And when it comes to little kids, they need to have some kind of hero traveling from one book to the next.
Children don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly produces tracts for parents, telling them what is happening in modern children’s literature, what books to look at, and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to carry books outside the reading hall.
Only children have this magic privilege.
...there's a square hatch in the back of the library with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the bookstore.
Steps will be squeaking under your feet - it's a very old time machine.
You see the book of your childhood as an old friend: hi, it's good that we don't change.
Ally's still walking on the track with yellow brick, the lazy Tola Reddies steals magic matches, and the Boys-Kibalchish never said to the damn bourgeoons of the War Privy - that's the word he's got.
Books like passwords can be used anywhere to get to know one's own.
There's real book rares in the vault, like a pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and eras.
Or lead Coronenko in a famous app to the Niwa magazine.
Or a 1936 Muzzle embroidery.
Time has aged the pages, colored them in tea.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are the fragments of our future collection, I dream of getting retired and doing rare children's books.
But the kids won't take it, so to speak, and the paints in the old books aren't very bright, and the themes... open the front page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it's like, why did we all write out this Pioneer Truth?
But it was still interesting, "The Russian Planet" by Galina Ilyasov, the head of the book store.
The pages of the "Murzzle" are getting dark from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna runs the bookstore for her whole life.
She knows the color of Buratino's hat, in which school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Griffdor team at the Quidditch Cup, in which situations Carlson uses the engine's silencer, and what Alice Seleznov's father works.
A librarian pays little for his work, and everyone who can live without these book rows finds a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, educators, chaplains of the book.
You can also recognize them by smiling - it's thought to be a professional feature of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I do love children's books: as a librarian, I like them to be, to stand right and beautifully on the shelves, and I love to read them,' said Galina Vasilievna.
I read all: military, historical, fairy tales, fantastic.
Reading modern Russian writers, new translations...
Of course, I think it was different when I was a kid.
The books were the most exciting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And since I loved them crazy, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be despite the Riders.
And I'm thrilled when our former readers bring in children, if not grandchildren...
Rumor mill: There's no disagreement in Celtic.
Griffiths denied the conversations at the Celtic after Dale's admission that Hops was in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest against the Scotland Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warburton is afraid of signing contracts in January, which may disrupt the team's unity.
"Dons" has increased the advantage of Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first-time penalty gave Aberdin a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodri, which allowed Dons to break off Celtic by five points.
Griffiths disproved the talk of disagreement
This led to rumours of disagreements in the Celtics, which were cut off by Griffiths, who claimed that he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling the strain, I think the players want it.
The Dutch are bored, because the Scots aren't in the race for the title - de Boer
A former paramilitaire from Rangers and a former member of the Netherlands team, Ronald de Boer, claimed that the Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtic as he was not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently a representative of Ayaxa, said, "In Holland, the most attractive moments of Celtic play no longer appear, why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of stress in "Old Company" games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach vowed to make a difference.
The defeat of Malmö, and the resulting exit from the League of Champions, was soon followed by the loss of 10 footballers to Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the table by five points.
But Dale said, "The Slithet had bad times before, and we're gonna go out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very unfortunate, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And so do we, but we need to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic support, because that makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important right now.
Warberton, with distrust, is waiting for the January transfers
Despite the views that appeared just a couple of weeks ago, suggesting that he had identified some of the objectives of the January transfers, the Rangers' boss Mark Warberton distrusted the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the team's unity.
The former attacker of "Brentford" said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the season starts to adapt to them, which is what you saw in our own band this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Michu, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career.
Swansi's attacker Michu, linked to the Celtic during the transfer window, insinuated that he could leave the football after his contract with the Swans was over.
A 29-year-old player had an ankle problem for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to stand up to the SFA about Nelson's statements.
The Harts led with a 2:1, when Paterson was removed, and began to play 3:2, but the Red Card was later cancelled; this is the third red Collum card, which was cancelled in eight months.
Nelson does not give up saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tynxall.
The hard-core player of the Hibernian team received a reprimand after admitting to singing a song with insulting words about former Harts player Rudy Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tyncastle in March 2014.
"It was derby, and it was hot," said the assailant, adding, "I can say with confidence that I was not going to go back to Tyncastle if he didn't play for Celtic."
Donnelly: The Tannadis Council is confident in the management of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United Board of Directors is still confident that the team of managers will make a difference, but agrees that the deterioration in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys out again," said Donnelly.
McInnes is glad he won "uncertainly" from Hamilton.
Derek McInness admitted that his team, "Aberdin", had to fight desperately against "Hamilton Assis", to win the seventh consecutive league win, which put them five points above the Celtic, top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Rooney's first-time penalty.
McInness said, "There's no team here that's gonna win something - a cup, or a league championship, who didn't win meetings like this."
The rate of unemployment among Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing
THE unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher than that in the United Kingdom, as the National Statistics Service (ONS) figures showed.
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with 2,612,000 currently working.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent a quarter, an increase over the average of 73.5 per cent in the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Minister, David Mandela, commenting on the most recent figures, said: “The Government's long-term plan has laid the groundwork for the consolidation of the economy.”
It has been almost a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the Scotland labour market, with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Why am I a witness to the execution in Oklahoma?
Today, by avoiding legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch a person be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting at the death row gallery in Oklahoma State, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made in January, through a close friend of his, and, while I was in shock, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So why do it?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more people than places, the results of the grim lottery decide who will be selected.
In Oklahoma, the number of press places was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and he and I have a relationship after a few months of phone calls and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk to him.
The prison says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'm gonna have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of tweeting my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "would have better spelled it out myself," but still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he was talking.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that transparency will help the abolitionist movement.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I wrote down.
I'm not going to go into detail here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treeze make him guilty of abetting the crime.
But I believe there's a big chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was not enough evidence for the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this point of view, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't claim to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to contact.
From me, you'll know what it's like to watch a man I like die without need.
A man being chased by the police was persuaded to get out of the Canning River.
A constable from Canning Vale managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River and stay dry.
Perth was about to leave the police, but he was not able to find himself in the dirt water in the shallow water a few yards from a police officer who was trying to "tempt him to go to shore."
Cunning Vale Police was summoned on Tuesday for illegal entry into a foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them, rushing to Canning.
But it didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I won't go out, come on, grab me," said Sgt. Sandell Castledyne.
Constable Lachlan Perhavetsu didn't really want to wet his uniform, so he used a more secure method of "talking with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says Sgt. Castledyne.
That's what the Ben Cazins footballer remembers.
In 2006, Cazins went to the quail to avoid meeting a police patrol to test for alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts proved to be in vain, but they encouraged the locals to invent a joke "Ben Kazin's Biatlon."
Peter Moody accuses the stewards of trying to spy and threatening to quit the horse sport.
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to infiltrate a spy in his stable last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
He was targeted by stewards and members of the Racing Victoria Ethics Department, who he accused of running a campaign against him in person, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the start because of the violation of the rules for the use of drugs on the day of launch, on Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always making every effort to take part in the races, and he's in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of the Lydari test on the Kobalt, which he can't explain.
He's been holding his tongue about the suspicion of spying for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I didn't want to say anything about it, and I've been through it for a long time, but sometimes it's so out of your mind that you're no longer holding back," said Moody.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to deal with the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head up high, and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think it's not, then I need to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody had been sensational during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department had tried to spy in his stable.
"A half a year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'd call if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to pass on information about what I'm doing in my stable," said Moody at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all make an application, as they failed to catch me.
Robert Rollston, the former president of RVL, David Moody, the current president of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the external executive director of RVL, knew about it all the time and now know it.
Shouldn't it make me think it's getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold people accountable for what's happening in this business other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I that bad for this profession?
Maybe people out there think that's what it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me out, and I don't doubt what I'm talking about can make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and hold them responsible for the decision.
I have family support, and I can go.
The coach's resentment had only grown during a long investigation into the case of Kobalt and Lidari, and the last removal of the horse from the start made him say that he might "shuttle his license to the table."
Moody, most famous for training the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the prescriptions for the use of drugs on the day of the competition "smart" after the horse was put on its feet with a compress of clay, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules at the races.
"I must bear full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put a compress on her leg.
She might have got a compress last night.
She might have got it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him the day of the race.
Moody can be disqualified for three months under the rules for the use of drugs on the day of the compress competition, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need the rules, but it went too far," said Moody.
The driver who hit and escaped from the Cobram incident was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobra and ran off the scene this weekend.
A motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car in Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic regulations.
A 40-year-old motorcyclist in Cobrama stays at the hospital in a stable state.
Coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellamy's putting up with the adversarial charges for the use of force.
Coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the ball's interception by his team as the "animation of the agenda" by the two winners of the NRL championship.
Coach "Sydney Rusters" Trent Robinson stated that the judges allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during the sudden victory of the "Storm" at the final of the Sydney qualifying game on Friday night.
Brysbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear hint on "The Storm" after his team won the finals of the qualification tournament at North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" for the rugby league and said that the two of Queensland's team weren't "t too successful" in the hands-on fight.
Bellamy defended the ball with his team and said that they were just focused on the "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he had the confidence to criticize his team by the two top coaches, because that means they're worried about the possible defeat of the Storm.
"This keeps coming up -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about the hard-core when they beat us with a score of 24:2, "says Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can promise you that we haven't changed anything in our systems or defenses for a year, just over the past six weeks we've been paying special attention to contacting the ball, and that was a turning point for us.
Trent's been out there for three years, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always manifests at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football" by reminding his teacher that "St. George's Illavarra Dregons" Bennett won the 2010 championship with "smart" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night, and to see how impressive the game was,' Bellamy remarked.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he's got a team that can show what he thinks is an impressive football, especially his young semi-protectors at their speed.
This is the football you'd like to play when you have such players.
He made that comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two semi-protective men like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence, because they say these things, because they're a little concerned about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the "Storma" and "Rusters" were a match with more points than the "Broncos" and the "Cowboys".
The "Broncos" game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game, it was 8:18, there were two more attempts - and what, that's an impressive football?
Or do you think breaks and failed attempts are impressive?
It's routine to me.
If they mention us, that means we can meet them there at some point.
Storm's weekend off, as they won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Kronolla Sharks next Saturday night at the pre-finals at the AAMI Park Stadium, the tickets will be on the market next Tuesday morning.
An accused of possessing drugs, the Serbian is on bail for $200,000.

Marco Maximovich, 29, is one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht, which traveled from South America through Vanuatu and was moored in Coomer in August.
Throughout the morning, Maximovich and his associates were seen at the dock, and later he met them at the Comera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maximovich is facing a life sentence for trying to commit drugs in sufficient quantity to sell, counsel for Maximovich argues that there is no evidence that the latter was trying to get the whole shipment, and that the man may have been in the café without any intent.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
The mother and stepfather of Maximovich were asked to make a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
"It is clear from both accounts that the $200,000 bond is too much of a financial burden for them," remarked Judge Flanagan.
But this is not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximović was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he would surrender his Australian and Serbian passport, report daily to the police and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsicaris: "I'm proud of the team of Greece, which has been fighting for the last few seconds."
The main coach of the Greek team, Fotis Katsicaris, paid tribute to his team after the 1/4 of the Eurobaset 2015 finals with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was determined by some mistakes.
It was a big game, quoted by the AFP Katsicaris.
We've been getting ready for a great Spanish play.
We tried to work in the defense, but the defense's failure determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought till the last second.
Joel Freeland: "In the CSKA, I will be entrusted with Kaun's functions."
CSK's newest member, Joel Freeland, claimed he didn't believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroliga next season.
I've been talking to coach Dimitris Itudis a few times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, quotes Freeland's R-Sport.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to restructure to center position, but I was more of a forward in the NBA.
Now we're gonna have to face the big center of the rival, but I've done it before, so I think I'm gonna do it right now.
The army won the Euro League for the last time in 2008.
Since then, they've made six trips to the Final Four, but they can't show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling someone jinxed the team.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's hard, I get the frustration of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we show the best we can do, we have a good chance to win the Euro league, I really think so.
I've always wanted to win this title, the Moscows have won the tournament, and I think this year will be the CSKA.
As for the jinx, I am not a superstitious man, and I do not believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, it's all possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as I can.
Louis Henriquet: "To me, a match with "Roma" will be a special one."
The Chief Trainer of the Barcelonas, Luis Henrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the 1st Tour of the League of Champions with a special sense.
According to the mentor, the face-to-face match of his current and former team will be far from normal for him.
Recall that Luis Henrique trained the “wolves” in the 2011–12 season, but failed to show himself to the best in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I gained some experience.
I have a very warm memory of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that big a deal.
The main thing is to start in the League of Champions with a win.
The August meeting at the John Gamper Cup will not affect the team's actions in the next match.
I'm waiting for the "Roma" game that she showed in series "A" against "Juventus."
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "The Red-Aider" has different options for attacking."
Acting Chief Trainer of the Ural, Vadim Scripchenko, in the run-up to the 9th Tour of the League with the "Crasnodar" pointed out the variety of attacking schemes of the rival team.
According to the mentor, "bows" have several models of attack in their arsenal.
The match will take place on 21 September and will begin at 4.30 p.m. in Moscow time.
How do we play with the "Redmaker," let's see, is the official website of the "Urala" of the word "Scriptchenko."
We've got a week ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking, and it's carrying out its attacks in many ways, and we're not slow, so I think it's gonna be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given the fact that the Transnodar is holding a League of Europe match against the Dorthmund "Borussia", we will try to prepare ourselves very well to win.
Rocher Kanyas: "The House of Astana can take the points from anyone."
After the 1st Tour of the League of Champions with the Benfica (0:2), a half-defendant of "Astana" Roher Kanyas expressed his confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
In the view of the hawbek, in their field, the astonishers are able to take points from any opponent.
Even though the match was hard for us, I can tell you that we played well, which is the official UEFA website of Kanyas's word.
"Benfica" is top class, but in the home match, I think we can count on taking their glasses.
It's real.
But first we need to think about Galasarea, and then we need to think about Atletico.
In the home games, we can take the points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I'll say it all the time: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Raphael Benitez, the Chief Trainer of the Reals, expressed his satisfaction at the major victory in the 1st Tour of the League of Champions with the Shahter (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to forward Cristian Ronald, who was the author of three heads.
The match was not easy, because "The Checker" knows how to control the ball, which is the official UEFA website of Benitez's word.
The opponent didn't have many moments, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I won't say "Real" was perfect, but we've had a lot of shots.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and hit four.
Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll say it all the time.
Jordy Alba: "Cristiano Ronald can't match Messi."
The advocate of the Barcelonas, Jordy Alba, is of the view that no one can compare with his single clubboy, Lionel Massey.
According to the Spaniard, forward "Real" to Cristiano Ronaldo can't do that either.
Messi is five heads above the others, - quotes Le Figaro Albu. - What Leo can do can't be anyone.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, things change, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniel De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only a unique style, but also a bright personality.
"Roma's half-backer, Daniel De Rossi, noted the importance of compaction and backup in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 9:45 Moscow time.
Let's remind you, "SE" will be broadcasting it text.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team with great players, quotes the official website of UEFA De Rossi.
It's hard to play with blue-grenades, because they have not only unique styles, but also bright identities.
To keep them, we're gonna have to work around the entire match and back up each other.
Messi is almost always successful when it comes to wrapping up, so we need to keep compact and organized.
Jezov is hoping to be a start-up member of the SKA in a match with the Slovene.
The UKA's Golkiper, Ilya Jezov, stressed that he was hoping to be part of the army's start-up team in the next HLF match.
Jezov went out on the ice instead of Mikko Coskinen at the 23rd minute at the $0:3 and reflected all the shots at his gate, and the fourth goal was missed by the SCA after replacing the goalie with a sixth field player.
The next match will be held by the team on the outlet against Slavanov.
I hope I'm going out in the next start-up game, and I say "R-Sport" to Jezov.
I'm not a gatekeeper expert, I'm a gatekeeper, we don't have any reruns of missing heads, so it's hard to track.
Dinamo's been good, everybody's got a bad match.
The team still lost.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.

Steve Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of child abuse.
Steve Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered with the Internet message service, where he received a number of obscene images of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found a missing phone, and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She checked him out and found shocking pictures, and immediately drew her mother's attention.
The police arrived and saw five images, after which they examined the computers found at this address, and found “appropriate” requests in the search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it, because it might have "attracted the paedophiles," and then he would've pretended to be a cop to frighten them."
The Chief Justice, Aileed Robertson, told the sheriff's court in Dundee: "He claimed it was a passion, and he was addicted to frightening people.
He admitted to making requests on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to frighten paedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him images and about asking for more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, trembling and crying.
She saw obscene images on her phone, and the defendant was given a fair bet.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the defendant had used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of making indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating the terms of bail on 25 January this year and not appearing at the court hearing on 24 March this year.
The defendant's counsel, Gregor Sim, made an application not to place Hogg on the list of sex offenders, since it can be shown that the crime did not have a “significant sexual element”.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael suspended the sentence until October, pending the receipt of a statement from the social services.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but he was taken into custody before the opening of the hearings in the other remaining cases.
It was added to the list of persons who had committed sexual offences even before the date of sentencing.
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is reading the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest national leader, had fallen down the ladder from the podium earlier this year.
He didn't get hurt, but the video with the crash scene was instantly spread on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by the statements of the parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats warning them against whistling Mugabe at the time of the address.
A month ago, they mastered the president during his address to the nation in Parliament, a speech that Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Goneze, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The report came from a number that is not displayed, but is entitled `Death'," he informed the journalists at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned the members of Parliament that the immunity would end in the House of Parliament, and as soon as they left, parliamentary immunity would not work.
The member of Parliament stated that the party led by Morgan Tswangirai was “concerned” by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard aims to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs under its programme of restructuring and reducing service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated reduction in jobs will cost approximately $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, in Hewlett-Packard's statement.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than ever to respond to the growing demands of our clients all over the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of over US$ 50 billion and “focus on the provision of previously unattainable complex technology solutions” to companies, as reported by the company.
This is how a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment, whose garage in Palo Alto was called the “place of birth of the Silicon Valley.”
Hewlett Packard is in the process of major restructuring to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This HP, the world's second personal computer manufacturer, and one of the US's largest tech companies, is the most recent event in this sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are working better.
Captain "Arsenal" Mikkel Arteta says that his same-clubs should support the traumatized Jack Wilshire before playing "Dinamo Zagreb."
In a conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that it was still September, and that if Wilshire's restoration went as planned, there would be nothing to stop him from getting back to the game for Christmas.
With the most favorable development, Wilshire will miss exactly at least four of the next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Cup next summer remains in question.
Most of all, in this recent problem, Wilshire finished the previous season with a single ankle injury and was about to return to the normal aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury is not a threat to his career."
It's just not a complete healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not about the ankles or the injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger also admitted, there is a associated risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to the Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire suffered 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal scale, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting in 2007-08, the Arsenal was one of the two prime league clubs, which account for the most missed days due to the injuries.
Hungarian accepts the possibility of getting stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you're back in line after an injury, you've been vulnerable for a while - in that time you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he'll recover physically, I'm sure of it, as well as the fact that his career will be the one he deserves.
The Arsenal launches a campaign at the League of Champions on Wednesday with the Dinamo-Zagreb and will continue with the Chelsey game on Saturday and next Wednesday with the Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger is planning a rotation.
Héctor Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Mathieu Debushi and Arteta will be playing in the start-up team.
It is possible that Wenger will also include Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Girou instead of Nacho Morelia and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little rest to the players who need it," Hungarian said.
Although "Arsenal" is an absolute Favorite in group F, the "Maximir" Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most depressing in Europe.
Dinamo hasn't lost any of the 41 games since they managed to spend the last season as "The Invincibles."
On Tuesday night, the stadium was struck by an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that the Arsenal learned the lesson of last season, when the team was defeated in the Monaco League of Champions, and remains with a low hope to lead the club to the finals of the Cup of Champions.
"This is an incredible drive," noted Wenger.
The Arsenal has never done this before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with seniority.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FryendsFest: a comedy show that taught us some serious lessons in men's friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate the need for men to be candid, is now more than ever, and the suicide rate among young men is at the highest in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the single largest cause of death among men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more common than women.
In an effort to address the problem of "The Campaign Against Unhappiness", she declared 2015 as the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of over 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression has shown that if the patient has enough friends in a “normal mood,” the chances of recovery are double.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of emotionally healthy friends halves the risk of mental illness.
But, of course, for a friendship to work, first of all, it needs to be.
In an era when social media is managed, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often more appreciated than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving fun and successful, even if loneliness is real.
This superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, all at the expense of our inner values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which is more likely to affect our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently pointed out, the maker of video games, you don't actually buy any more happiness with money.
The merit of the Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each character was not defined by his or her work, but rather by the person that was manifest in his or her association with his or her friends.
Joey's humor and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's breath on Rachel -- all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As Samaritance said to me, "...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal is to stress how even the smallest of friends can be of benefit."
Often, men who come to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching of "live with it" is strong, as is the feeling that a frank conversation about problems can be perceived as a weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that come to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the slightest moments of men's friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the status of a foreigner, who is talking over the phone, helps people in times of despair, while long-term support comes from a close circle of families and friends.
So, if you're going to see FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the decorations have been fully rebuilt for the festival, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or, even better, if you see a single person in Starbucks, smile and say, "Hello."
You don't have to guess what a friendship can do.
The Freeds series is shown on the Comedy Central from the start to the end, all 236 episodes, by the tag #FriendsFest
Dee Maria scores a goal, helping the SVU to defeat the Malmö.
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Mathudy and Edinson Cavanaugh, celebrates the hits of the Malmö gate.
Angel di Maria, debuting at the League of Champions, scored a goal, which allowed SGG to easily pass the Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavanaugh did their job when "Pary St. Germain" began his game at the League of Champions with a very convenient win of 2:0 against "Malmö" at Park de Prince Stadium on Tuesday.
Dee Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Champions as a PSW player to direct to the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavanaugh scored a goal for 61 minutes.
In addition to Real Madrid and the Donets' Checker in group A, "Pary" had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champs, as they were not aiming at playing-off, but at the continuation of a series of successful games for the last three seasons, where they had reached the quarterfinals.
They earned the glasses, but at the same time, it was not the best decision of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovich to be useless in the attack and later to replace him on the field in a game against a team from his hometown and club, where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at home in the League of Champions, so win at 2:0, get the opponents in trouble, and play well in the defense -- that's a good start, even if there's more things we need to do during the season," said Blanc.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, even though I wish we had scored one or two more.
Ibrahimovich returned after being injured in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her a 2-2 tie in a match with the Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was taken to the back of Di Maria for a fourth minute.
The Argentine assailant was noted as a player who was able to take SVU to a new level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran out of Marco Verratty's way behind the defense of Malmö, he had a beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johann Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone then expected the SVU to win easy and big, they had to be disillusioned.
"Malmö", who beat Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, with nine world-class players in the field at the start of the game, five protectors and two teambacks in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of the hit by Nicola Jurdzic, where the ball flew past Kevin Trapp's long pants for the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
At the same time, SVU sometimes failed to deliver itself with inconclusive broadcasts and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovich, who, in the first half alone, was unable to make at least five attempts, and then failed to process the ball that was slaughtered by Cavanaugh as soon as the game resumed.
Nevertheless, he proved to be far more skilled in the exact pasture, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, who, Di Maria, had sent the ball with a twisted punch, which had passed by the pants by Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour's mark thanks to Cavanaugh, and the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovich set the ball to the center of the field with Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about getting back in the game, and only the catching of the ball by Viland from a close range prevented David Louis from increasing the final score before the replacement, Esekel Lovessie, did not count the goal at the very end of the match.
Coach "Malme" Aghe Hareide later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions was last December."
Since then, we've only been playing in the Swedish league, which is the wrong level.
Qualifications are not sufficient.
Hail "Pari"!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion in shares
The Swiss mining and trade giant Glencore, who had suffered from the fall in commodity prices, had earned $2.5 billion to sell shares as part of his ambitious debt-reducing plan.
Glencore, a London Stock Exchange company, made a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
A company that has lost 57 per cent of its market value is trying to cope with the collapse of commodity prices, while China’s recession is worsening demand and creating chaos in world markets.
As a result of the release of new shares at a preferential price, Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange took off on early morning tenders on Wednesday.
The stock rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which at the opening was 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore launched a $2.5 billion stock sale last week as part of a wide range of plans to reduce its 30 billion-dollar debt by about a third.
The company sold new shares at 125 cents apiece, a discount of 2.4 per cent to the price when the tender was closed on Tuesday.
It posted 1.3 billion new shares, representing 9.99 per cent of the company's statutory capital.
As a result of fear of a continuing recession in the Chinese economy, the value of iron ore fell by about half, while coal, copper, and other raw materials fell by 20 to 40 per cent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
On Tuesday, the White House confirmed in an official report that China's head of China, Xi Jinping, would be making an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, the first visit by Cy Qingpin to Washington, D.C., will take place on 25 September, and will be a follow-up visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The president and the First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will also receive Xi Jinping and Pan Liuan's wife at a government luncheon the evening after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
“The visit of President Xi Jinping will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the US and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as to enable the US and China presidents to deal constructively with controversial issues,” the report states.
It is expected that Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, will stop in Seattle to meet with the leaders of several leading US technology companies on his way to Washington, D.C., and then go to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi Jingping are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concern about the alleged cyberspionage by China and China’s growing categoricality on the issue of the disputed South China Sea.

At the same time, a very important cooperation treaty between the Tumen and Minsk Regions was signed.
The fact that a permanent seminar was held in Tumeni at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus also points to the value of our work.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of the Belarusians in the training of agricultural personnel, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial complex.
You've recently met the head of the region and the head of the city.
What topics have been discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakusev, he spoke of the region's cooperation with the Republic of Belarus under current difficult conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be addressed; they are needed to reduce the cost of machines to the final consumer.
Problems in the work of the “Belshina” Tumen's shopping house and options for preventing loss were discussed.
The issues are important, as investment projects must work well and profit the region.
Reference was made to the continued supply of UAO passenger and cargo equipment “MAZ” and to the development of the UAO service centre “MAZ” which was set up in Tumeni on the basis of the UAO “TPTP”.
The discussion also referred to the preparation of a visit by the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the year.
Another theme of the interview was the completion and signature of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relationships promise to come to a new level.
These questions also concerned the oblast centre.
During our meeting with the head of the city of Tumene, Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tumen bus park.
Around 100 buses are already "breathing in the mould," so a new shipment of cars from Belarus is needed to work on a gas-free, clean fuel.
Another aspect: the Tumen elevator factory is working with one of the leading manufacturers of the UAO lift product, Mogileviftmash, to receive the components.
In my view, this activity could be more active, given the new lifts programme at the district centre.
In addition, under the extended consul's powers, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increased trade and the supply of modern Belarusian technology in Zauralya was discussed.
A meeting with the Omi Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
There are five constituents of the Russian Federation in the extended consular district, but Tumen is a district headquarters.
The region is a platform for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Gent Consul.
Generally speaking, such meetings are both relevant and good in order to deal directly and quickly with many of the problems, defusing them and promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current context, it is vital that we not break the gap by continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon won't focus on the ethnic diversity of people involved in filmmaking.
Matt Damon had an argument with the African producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that there was no need to take account of the ethnic composition.
During the Sunday release of the Project Greenlight on HBO, a prominent actor interrupted Brown when she tried to stress the need for alternative views on the main black character in the scenario selected for the project.
"Multiversity is appropriate when you cast for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
Curious Brown, in spite of her ears, exclaimed, "Oh, wow, well, well," all the time, while the actor from "Marciane" was commenting live.
In order to discuss the finalists, Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers.
"I'd like the participants - no matter who's gonna be the director - to think about the way Harmony's image they're going to follow," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a hooker beaten by a white pimp.
The producer of the film "Dear White People" advocated that Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio become the film's directors; Damon was strongly opposed to saying that "we may not end up getting what we want."
After this discussion was aired on TV, social media exploded with disapproving comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni was angry about the video: "Explanation of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room that hurts so much."
The tweet scored more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "lakes."
Damon's comments are coming up right when the most urgent issue on the agenda of the public debate is the literate coverage of race in the media.
After a boy named Michael Brown was shot dead by a policeman in 2014, Black Lives Matter became popular throughout the country, calling on lawmakers and the authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colored population.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the movement at the time of the nomination of the "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards.
"Alboms still matter," he said.
Like the books and the lives of blacks, the albums still matter.
Most recently, Black Lives Matter's leaders issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News staff member Elizabeth Hasselbek as to whether the group would be viewed as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders of the movement reported.
It was recently announced that Damon was on the list of show business leaders, producers, and media magnets invited to visit the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unknown whether the actor accepted the invitation and met the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion
A professional climber and waiter, Isaac Caldiero, was the first to win "American Ninja Warrior" on Monday night, taking home the $1 million prize.
At this sporting show, the seventh season of which has just ended, none of the participants have ever been able to complete all the tracks with obstacles.
In the finals of the season, two participants, Caldier and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task was to climb a rope 75 feet long in 30 seconds.
Brittann was the first to perform the mission, and he was the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warrior, which passed through the exhausting phase of 4, but Caldiero was able to complete the task three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After the victory, which was incredibly hard, Caldiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview with "E!News".
"It's incredible to think about it, because I've never made or lived for more than $10,000 a year," I remarked to the journalist E!
And all of a sudden... I never even imagined how it was... the future was unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with "The Hollywood Reporter" to talk about the finals and why Brittany, the first one on the track, would not get any money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest bidder.
"If the finishing players are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them," he said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still enjoys great satisfaction.
I don't think he's feeling offended about it.
He's happy with what he did.
He got a ton of thrilled fan reviews.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "if I was meant to lose, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if we'd switch roles.
"America Ninja Warrior" will be back with the eighth season, which will be filmed in the spring of 2016.
"Detroth Tigers" quietly run around "Minesota Twins"
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers is now ranked last in the Central Division of the American League.
Pretending to be a hindsight, the Tigers won the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday, with a total of 5-4 on the "Targuetfield."
The Twins missed the chance to cut half-game behind Houston Astros and to take second place in the playoffs after the winners.
For the Detroits, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which slipped away most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they do," said the manager of the Tigers, Brad Osmus.
Pitcher "Tagers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution in support of the attacks, as a result of which Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added another one in the sixth and the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start in nine exits.
"I just want to end the year with good scores," said Simon.
Pitchers don't get to drop in every game, so I want to go deeper in the game.
Victor Martinez, the designated beater of the Tigers, was able to take three hits and scored two wounds, the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since the four hits in the game against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with a bat," said Osmus.
He's been good at (the quality of the batter), clearly better at the bat, and he's kept that quality for the game.
After three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to get back in the game.
The central host Byron Buxton opened the inning with a doll on the left side of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making the bow, took the first base, and the second baseman Brian Dozier got a strike out at Simon's swing before his place was taken by left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy beat Moira, the only player in the way, before the new appointed beater Miguel Sano, who hit a double-track single left of right-hand Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of incredibly off-tracks, and a comparable wound at the second base of Verhagen, it was possible for the third baseman, Trevor Pluff, to be hit in a double-play.
It was the 27th time for a top league player this season, when Pluff hit the ball on a double-player.
After Detroit added cover wounds in the first half of the ninth inning, Moyer earned RBI a "double" in the space between the out-of-fielders against Bruce Rondon's closing pitcher.
However, the right-hand player beat Sano after three strikes and got his fifth fairy.
Detroit took advantage of the temporary non-practice Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers made three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the list of injured until the game itself, missing for more than a month due to the inflammation of his back.
"Surely not the start I'd like," Hughes said, "but as the game developed, I became more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning."
After the first batter hit the first base, Hughes left the single to Ian Kinsler.
Wok at the two outs of Ritzfielder J. D. Martinez led Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first shot in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his "0 for 21" series with an early start in an effective position.
The third-base player, Nick Castellanos, followed by a "syngle" with another wound, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to get close to the third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning, getting a single-out "dub" from the catcher James McCann and a double-out single from the central beater Anthony Gose, and that became 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager "Twins" Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got right at the right point.
Hughes, whose throws were considered to have been thrown in an unattainable third inning, was replaced by a right-hand reliver, A. J. Ahter.
Hughes was numbered three times six hits and a four-strike-out Wook.
NOTES: Pitcher, right-hand "Tagers", Anibal Sánchez left the player because of the right arm stretch.
He will be screened by Dr. James Andrews, who had been doing a shoulder surgery to Sanchez as early as 2007.
For Sanchez, who has been on the trauma list since mid-August, it is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, the left-handed pitcher, Daniel Norris, will leave the list of traumatized people and go out against the Twins.
Norris, who made four start-ups with the Tigers since it was acquired in exchange for David Price's left-hand pitcher on July 30, has one win and one defeat.
He had not been in the games since August 20, due to the spraining of his spleen.
"Tagers" and "Twins" will complete a series of three games at the "Targuetfield" on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play pitcher-right Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original Cadyrov's complaint for the book "Molba to God" went to the South Pacific Court.
The South Pacific City Court received the original appeal by the representative of the President of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, against the decision to accept the "extremist material" of the book "Molba to God: Its Importance and Place in Islam", by Interfax, referring to the president of the mountainous Alexander Chuhrai.
The Court is now awaiting possible objections from the participants in the trial.
Chuhray refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the State Duma of the Russian Federation to test the mountainous for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIL.
"Let them comment on such stupidity themselves," he said.
On 11 September, the South Pacific City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalia Perchenko's decision to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
There was an appeal from the Office of the Attorney-General of South Sahalinsk on Friday night.
There are nuances: the Public Prosecutor's Office believes that they have asked the court to consider extremist only the author's opinion, not the Koran.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision, "Chuhray reported.
The decision to accept the book as “extremist material” was taken on August 12, 2015.
In particular, “extremist” quotes from the Koran, “We worship you, and we call upon You for help,” and “Do not call upon anyone along with Allah.”
Cadaver called the decision makers on the book "Shitans and Provocators".
He called on the deputies of the State to prohibit by law judicial decisions relating to the texts of the Holy Books.
“I firmly believe that the State Duma must pass a law which prohibits the taking of judicial decisions concerning the specific texts of the Koran and other Divine Words,” Cadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intend to remove posts and comments that have a negative impact on migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
It is the intention of the Facebook management, together with the German Ministry of Justice, to combat manifestations of xenophobia and racism online.
For example, the previous day, the head of the Haiko Maas Department stated that the Ministry of Justice was currently working with social media professionals to set up a special group of monitors.
It is the duty of the participants to monitor and remove comments that are incorrect to migrants and refugees.
According to Hayko Maasa, it is assumed that the authors of the unstolerant posts will receive notice of the reason for the deletion of their entry.
Entities whose expertise collects complaints from social media users about abusive posts should also facilitate the rapid blocking of illegal content.
Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts that had been negative to migrants and refugees, the management of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice had been taken after the rise of xenophobic sentiments in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for this was the unprecedented migration crisis that struck the European Union some time ago.
For example, Germany is already overcrowded with all the sites intended to host refugees.
On the eve of the day, the authorities decided to temporaryize migrants in the former Buenwald concentration camp.
The internally displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are housed in baracks, where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
There will be relaxation zones in Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries are equipped with special areas for relaxation and psychological relaxation.
The first will be the Booth, Domodeovsky, and Shcherbin Cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troekur Cemetery in Moscow.
Such plots will follow in other parts of the city.
Artem Ekimov, the head of the State Budget Institution, Ritual, spoke about this portal.
The relaxation zones will be small greenlands like parks.
According to experts, in such “circles” visitors to the cemeteries will be able to rest, be alone and regain their psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovsky, Butovsky and Shcherbin cemeteries, and later in other parts of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU “Ritual”, if there is a need to expand the cemetery, the builders will try to keep the existing forest as much as possible.
Green plantations will serve as a living fence that will separate the rest areas and the squares placed directly under the graveyards.
The experts of the GBU, Ritual, also indicated their intention to make a proposal to remove the hedges at the graves.
New cemeteries can indeed become barren.
In addition, in GBU Ritual, the willingness to set up electronic terminals to enable visitors to learn GPS coordinates and grave number plates.
In June of this year, Ritual also proposed that the cost of burial services should be adjusted according to the time of the year.
So, digging a grave in summer time will cost a thousand roubles less, weeks in winter, when the ground is frozen.
Note that in the last year, the cost of all forms of ritual services has on average increased by 10 per cent.
Five days later, a lost fungi was found in the forest.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without food.
It was possible to find the mountain fluster thanks to the combined efforts of rescue workers and volunteers.
Alexander Pannikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old pensioner from the Tamba oblast spent five days in the forest."
No food or water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even movie-makers with dogs, but there was no result.
It was possible to locate the man after the helicopter was involved in the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods to pick up the mists and the submersibles, but did not return by the evening.
The family immediately sought help, and the next day, rescue workers and people from a nearby village - only about 30 people - had been raised to find a fungi.
A fire and rescue centre helicopter joined them for the fifth day.
Andrey Seletkov, the head of the search and rescue team of the Smolensk Fire and Rescue Center, said, "The heli was enlisted, the man was found."
Gone very far, completely elsewhere.
It was about 12 kilometers from the search site.
He went a huge distance at his age.
It was a miracle to live.
Grybnik was taken to the county central district hospital unconscious, in a very difficult state.
He was diagnosed with pneumonia as well as severe dehydration and overcooling.
As an elderly man was able to survive after five days in the forest, the doctors have no idea.
Valentina Nepša, head of Therapeutic Department of the Lennin CBR: "Personal examination, treatment."
Infuse therapy, antibacterial.
Given all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, and it's still hard, but it's good.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich arrives every year in Smolenchen from the Tamba oblast.
His grandson says his grandpa used to go to pick mushrooms, but far into the forest never went further.
Alexei Spitchenko, grandson of the found fungi, said, "Fores are not far from the road, they're not from here."
Went to visit his family for a few years.
So I went to get the mushrooms.
I guess it went a bit far and lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all parts of the Smolen region.
In the last few days alone, there have been five similar cases.
Squads are reminded of the need to walk into the forest in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches, and compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces behind so that you can return.
Emergency An-2 sat on the sidelines of a brother's taiga.
Right on the edge of Siberia's emergency An-2.
An emergency landing was made by Enicey, a Red Airline, 68 kilometres from Bratsk.
No casualties or casualties, but the plane itself suffered significant damage upon landing.
An-2 was on a service flight.
It had three crew members on board, a commander, a co-pilot and a flight mechanic, reporting to Interfax.
The crash aircraft was flown along the route of Cereznogorsk-Ilimsk to Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already arrived in Bratsk.
The Brother Transport Attorney's Office, following the crash landing of An-2, began to verify compliance with the air safety legislation.
An investigation team from the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office left for the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their aircraft with passengers due to a technical failure at an abandoned secret airport in Komi.
Engines and on-board electronics failed on the ship, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
World Economics – Nobel laureate: globalization
The process of globalization should have contributed to the reduction of inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, and the income gap in the developing economies is on the contrary increasing.
Eric Muskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to the Chief Researcher of the International Laboratory for the Analysis and Choice of the INE, the 2007 Nobel Laureate for Economics, Eric Muskin.
In the last 20 years, the world has experienced an unprecedented rise in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization had predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," stressed Muskin.
China and India, for example, have experienced a major per capita growth in GDP.
But it's not all that cheerful.
It was expected that globalization would narrow the gap between the “poor” and the “poor” in poor countries, which was manifest in large income inequality and, more precisely, pay.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Muskin in his article “Why global markets have not reduced inequality in emerging economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by NEE.
With economist Michael Kremer, professor at Harvard University, Erik Muskin has developed an alternative theory that shows why the income gap in poor countries is increasing as globalization grows, it is similar to the INE of the World Health Organization.
In the new global market, specific processes are taking place.
To demonstrate them, Muskin has identified four levels of expertise - A and B for rich countries, C and D for the poor.
After globalization, D professionals from poor countries lack the skills to work with A and B professionals from rich countries.
And if workers at level C from poor countries are growing because of the co-operation with employees at level B from the rich, the workers at level D are not feeling growth, or their wages are falling.
The overall effect is that the internationalization of production will widen the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus increase the level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Muskin are offered an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality,” says Fouad Alesserov, a regular professor in charge of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-making, and the head of the Department of Mathematics of the World Health Organization.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a spike of empirical work in this field.
The solution, according to Eric Muskin, is to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, according to the scientist, do not have the means to do so, and companies are not in a position to pay for their training.
In such a situation, Governments, international agencies, NCBs and private foundations can play a significant role, according to Muskin.
The scientist points out that the theory that has been developed does not in any way call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has brought about and has borne fruit in the form of a country ' s GDP growth.
Durbent: The life bond of time.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, is celebrating its 2000th birthday in September.
In the holiday programme, the Dagestan National Cultures Festival and the old-time fair, the Derbent rugs and the Open Temples Day, the "2000 Two-Hour History Show" and the guided to the rebuilt Petra I Museum.
The medieval rocks of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, the ancient Arab inscriptions on the walls, the narrow streets, and the palace gardens all seem to have come off the pages of "The Thousands and One Night."
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been in place since ancient times.
Although the Roman Empire, Byzantine, Hazar Caganate, and the Golden Horde claimed him.
The age of the eastern platen, which grows in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mechets, is a couple of centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russia Forest Monuments Program.
The shadow of scattering crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
A visitor will be given a flavoured tea and adorned with Dagestan snacks - honey figs, hurma, musmula, noodles, ayranes and candy.
In Derbent, for centuries, they have used big samavages to drink a lot of tea at one time.
The inscription above the entrance to Juma's sword says the building was built in 115 A.D.
It's 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
This is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is astonished by the magnitude and solemnity of the arcades of the domes and cones, which are based on the square columns and are lit with sunlight from tiny windows.
The keeping and breeding of pigeons is a traditional passion for the people of Derbent.
The owners of the pets put pigeons in the yards, under the trees, in attics.
A thrilling sight is the upsurge in the sky of a pack of white pigeons that look like the fireworks of the festival.
For the sake of defence against the enemy, the ancient Persians closed the gates of the Cape with a double stone wall.
As it traveled 500 meters in the sea, it shut down Derbent Harbor.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well-preserved monument of the ancient fortification community.
The carpets in Derbent had been weaving since the fifth century, and until today the technology of this unique trade has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for any taste, i.e., wool, cotton, or bark of all colors and colors, with a vortex and without it, with a complex design and a bizarre high.
The construction of the city began with the malls, blocks of single-storey stone buildings.
Over the years, the masters have hardly changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioners on walls, and street lights remind us that you are not in the Middle Ages, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the plumbing that the Persians had built about a thousand years ago remained.
Today, ancient sources of water are still being used by locals.
Many Derbents prefer water from cranes to water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of pottery.
Powdering and signing vases, dishes, jars, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The pottery’s hands are still producing excellent ceramics for both practical and souvenir purposes.
In the days of the festivals and festivals, crowds are gathered under a stretched cane, at which students of the Republican School of Circulatory Art are present.
The history of amazing and risky skill lasts for centuries.
The new trend is that girls are increasingly seen among the cranes.
There's a museum called "Culture and the Home of the Old Durbent" in the ex-Girl Bathroom.
In the past, single girls and the bridesmaids were bathed here, accompanied by girlfriends, and now anyone who wants to see a conglomerate-cowl hall, hot and cold pools that have gone to the past bathing appetizers.
Most Derbent homes have hot water, but baths and steam are as popular as they used to be.
The benefits of warming the body with the ferry are written in ancient books.
After the bathing, the blood improves, the muscles become tired, and the body develops flexibility and ease.
The festival “Commonwealth”, which is held in the territory of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, is attended by the ethno-bodies of many parts of Dagestan.
The participants in the national suits dance, play folk tunes, sing the songs of the people of the Caucasus, and give visitors a tasty home cheese.
The kirchlar is the site of the grave of the 40 martyrs who made up their heads for Islam.
This is one of the most admired complexes for North Caucasus Muslims.
The yellow sarcophages have been carved from time to time from solid stone blocks and are, as Arabs have said, centred on the west-east axis.
The brothers Gabriel and Albert Yakubov cut and shave clients in a small salon near the Upper Market.
The barber's been in this place for years.
The receptions of the circulatory trade are passed on from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubov brothers can do not only the traditional but also the most modern hair.
On one of the streets of the Old City, there was a house in which the decabrist Alexander Bestujev-Marlinsky, who had been exiled to the Caucasus, lived.
After learning the Turkic language and collecting the ethnographic material, he described Derbent, the first third of the 19th century, with his ancient monuments, his life, and his home.
Teahan is a traditional club in the East, where only tea and homemade cookies are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, talk to friends, and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not encouraged to cross the threshold of tea.
The Derbent dance band "Caspius" was set up three years ago, but it had already taken part in national and Russian-level events.
The ensemble soloists rehearse every day, perfecting the folk of the Awar, Dargin, Tatian, Armenian dances.
As the evening breaks down, when the street lights are lit, the locals sit on berries next to the houses with the terraces.
Typically, Derbents discuss domestic matters.
But in the run-up to the jubilee, they are increasingly reminiscent of episodes of the unique history of their city, which has affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Cape region.
There was a business airport game in Domodedi.
A new form of training is being introduced in the capital.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport staff.
In Domodedo, the model of three air-havens was installed for this purpose.
Young people not only searched and registered the passengers, but also served the planes.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but in complexity it did not give way to reality.
Late flights, at the same time two passengers with fractures on board, the train was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, hell.
For the one who settled in the Domodedonov hangar, the standard set of tasks to be taken up by the newcomers.
In one hangar, three major airports from all over the world were stationed at once.
Today, there are four hundred students from capital colleges and colleges.
An unparalleled chance to learn all about the inner world of air-havens.
The registration of passengers, the maintenance of fixed-wing aircraft, and the traffic in baggage - even buses on the airfield, the stairs and the search of passengers - were entrusted to them.
And the passengers are a lot of trouble.
One had a problem with the documents, the other missed the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you have to deal with it all, like in life, in a minimum.
For each of these tasks, they are paid a certain amount, virtual money, as if they had been paid by the airline for the maintenance of the flight.
“A fine is charged for failure to perform the tasks,” explains the Financial Analyst of the game, Dmitry Hilko, in an interview with the "West-Moscow".
Officials from the Ministry of Education are following the matter closely.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try out a new form of study.
She's already found a place in high school.
“Six cross-regional centres of competence will be established, which will be, in fact, new models for modern colleges with modern management systems, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment,” says Natalia Zolotaryev, Director of the Department of State Policy in the area of training of workers and additional professional training of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
But the students aren't up to global plans.
After three days of training, it looks like they're gonna need a day off.
At the same time, the scores for the exam had a very material expression.
The newest smarts, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them for responding in a timely manner to the claim to our airport at Instagram," a contented member of the game, the PR manager of the "Frankfort Airport" team, Sergei Shuvalov.
The best judges, called the pencil, were taken to invite them to work by the time they finished their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the United States Centre's foreign literature at the Library.
The Centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply deplores the unilateral decision of the Russian government to shut down the American Embassy Centre at the M.I. Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
“The single-party steps taken by the Russian Federation recently call into question the Russian Government's commitment to the links between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the Cold War and in other difficult moments of the long history of our relations,” states the statement by US Ambassador John Tefft to Interfax.
The American Centre has created deep and strong links between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital and served as a venue for meetings with numerous American eminent personalities, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year, the American Centre held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Education Exchange Program.
The Green Tribunal was quick to kill.
Typical situation: four officials stand at the table of Judge Swattanter Kumar, listening to his claims for the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of it, Kumar says.
If any more bricks are placed, we'll order you to take down all the existing buildings.
Kumar is the head of the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial body established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution of the environment, which has accompanied the booming economic growth of recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal had managed to address more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dams.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: in the under 60 years since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development, India has become one of the world's most overcrowded and polluted countries.
The problem is particularly acute in the major mega-cities, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are smog-rich, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few remaining habitats are being cut off to new neighbourhoods.
Despite the formal support of the State for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
For example, in May this year the Minister of the Environment called the court's decisions “extreme” and “implementable”.
Sometimes the court's decisions cannot be carried out within the time limit set by the court is confirmed by Raj Panjwani's environmental counsel.
Incompletable defaults, however, have a positive side: at least they make the responsible move.
"His main purpose is to shake this system," adds counsel.
The Green Tribunal has on several occasions cancelled major structures: the cessation of the construction of the airport, the power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
People are also being tried to keep in mind: for example, during a discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagnan, which polluted the local fluoride River.
We can close your factory, but we are responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations are far from always comprehensible to the common people, whose lives can be changed by one stroke of the pen.
For example, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, causing public outrage.
Despite a sharp drop in popularity and criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to overturn the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the New Delhi Government on the in and out of the car, and offered to buy 10,000 extra buses before the factory found out if they were in a position to do the same.
As sources of pollution, such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents began to come to the attention of the courts, the anger of the people began to slow down a bit.
But the most sick subject of the principled judge was the Ganges River Clean-up Programme, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for the Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and shifts to a scream.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water out of the Ganges on the statue of God, and there were feces in it, - the judge is hot. -
You keep contaminating the river because you think Ganges is Ganges, he'll take all of our sins.
This is the river we worship, and look what you do to it every day.
The clean-up of the Ganges is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new Government.
At present the number of fecal bacteria in this river is more than 120 times the norm.
Each year, between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million Indians bathing in it die of infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganges Rescue Fund money from the sale of his suit, where he met Barack Obama and 455 items from his private collection.
The ecologists immediately blamed the premiere for populism: the suit was purchased for $700,000, while the cleaning of the river takes at least eight billion.
Proponents of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can claim to be a developed country, but do not believe that the cost of progress should be ecology.
"In a developing country, the talk of the environment is often perceived as an unacceptable luxury, "says the activist "Gang's Call" Malik Bhanota.
And the court is trying to find a golden balance between ecology and development."
The man was blooding a number of Dali's paintings at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the exhibition of the Latvian Arts Union in Riga broke the windows of the museum and ruined the sculpture of El Salvador Dali's "An angel's appearance."

Xi Jinping calls for making the economy more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to boost its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in his address to the group that faces the challenge of managing the reforms.
“China must focus on attracting foreign investors and experts, and develop a policy of openness,” he said, addressing the participants at the 16th meeting of the Central Lead Group Committee on the Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
He said that greater openness and deeper reform would give the economy new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group had adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of market access regulations for investors, the modification of border controls, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE), the attraction of private capital, and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually re-engineered through pilot programmes.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more significant role in the allocation of resources, the rule of law in the business sector and greater openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken control over the powers given to them by guaranteeing that the companies will run their own business.
The statement also states that China will allow the border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors in order to open up public-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its policy on foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financed companies and provide them with better conditions,” states the application.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or a “green card”, will be further facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process.
The meeting also discussed the promotion of the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to an official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Lee Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended.
