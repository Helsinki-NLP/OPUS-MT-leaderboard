In Kineshma and the district, two men committed suicide.
Previously, one of the hangers had already attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1:00 in the village of Lugovoi, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
He was known to have tried suicide earlier.
What prompted a man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, took his life in his home.
No signs of violent death have been found, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs Press Service, “Kineshimsky”.
A black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the splintering highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box carefully installed on the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile that drives and transmits this information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to upgrade the old American motorway finance system by the planning bodies of Washington and the state.
Normally, the boring stage of motorway planning has suddenly generated intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you pass, and perhaps even where you pass them, and then to use this information in the compilation of tax accounts.
The tea party is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life.
And even though Congress is not yet in a position to agree on whether or not to continue, a number of states are not going to wait.
They think about how it is possible to move over the next decade to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of the road they pass.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“This is not a matter on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hasan Ihrata, Executive Director of the Southern California Association of Governments, who is planning to start tracking the state’s miles pass by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
There's already technology for that.
This is compounded by the fact that the Government Fund for the Construction of Highways, which is financed by the taxes that Americans pay on gas stations, lacks funds.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel more than a mile a gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high petrol prices.
“The tax on petrol is simply impossible to keep,” said Lee Mannick, an expert in transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 trackers had recently been installed to test the error pay system.
“This will be the best option in the long run,” he said.
Nerds call it the wrong user fee.
Not surprisingly, this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce road loads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are looking at the system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the state's ambitious global warming laws.
However, a member of the House of Representatives, Bill Schuester (Republican, Pennsylvania), the Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House, said that he also viewed the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-marketers at the Reason Foundation are also thrilled to make drivers pay for every mile.
“This is not just a tax that will go to a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Political Affairs, Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in 2011 called for Congress to move towards a margin of error.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, which would have involved some 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives had rejected the proposal because of the fear of rural legislators representing voters, who often had to travel many miles in daily life to get to work or to the city.
A number of states and cities are, however, on their own.
The state of Oregon is most enthusiastic, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for a mile instead of a tax on gas.
In Nevada, the pilot project has been completed.
In New York, it is under consideration.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the involvement of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of the 17 states of the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the Government was able to track each move.
“Anxiety about the big brother and stuff like that is a big problem,” said Alaouddin Khan, the head of strategy and efficiency management in the Transport Department of Nevada.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were well under way, the American Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will be easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technology infrastructure that will inevitably expand to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states in which a difficult search is under way for low-cost technology that would allow the state to keep track of the miles in the car, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do that, Han said, the community will feel more secure.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called True Milage.
Initially, the company did not assist in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market for a type of motor insurance, in which drivers pay on the basis of a mileage.
But the devices it's testing attract road designers, because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically downloaded by modem.
“People will be more likely to do so if you do not track their speed and location,” Ryan Morrison, executive director True Media.
There have been some major mistakes in some of these state pilots.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do so.
In Oregon, designers experiment with different options for drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can give up the device completely by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee on the basis of the average number of miles all the people of the state are passing.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of a guarded public, forcing the device to do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a tax scheme that will also accept parking billing, provide “pays as you drive” insurance, and collect a real-time pool of speed data from other drivers who could use to avoid traffic.
“Vehicles will attract the benefits that will be offered to them,” states the urban design document.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder if all talk of false pay is simply a huge distraction.
At the City Transport Commission in the Bay of San Francisco, officials say that the Congress could easily break the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Highways by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be charged to hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you need to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU is preparing support measures for Ukraine in the event of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a back-up plan for the provision of gas to Ukraine, as well as an agreement with the IMF on emergency credit, should Russia take any action in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
A stand-by loan is being negotiated with the IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million Euros from the EU itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing disagreements about the financing environment.
Nor does the international rating agency S&P, which lowered Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step to a "B-" with a "B" on Friday.
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can show flexibility in the credit environment, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a back-up option to provide Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which is now coming from Russia.
It's probably gonna be the Northflow gas or the back from Slovakia.
The latter, according to the officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and is likely to lead to a reduction in supplies to other regions.
“There are negotiations between the EU and the Ukrainians on how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but from other routes,” the source added.
Russia outside the campaign for urban pollution by car
Attempts to address the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most of the world's mega-cities since the second half of the twentieth century.
Typically, they were either re-engineered and extended roads, or attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time they were used.
The case of Singapore is well known, with a strict quota for the growth of private cars and the right to buy them at auctions.
Its price may be two to three times that of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced entry fees to the centre of the city.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green areas are used to allow access only to motor vehicles with a certain eco-class that also use high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Environmental Protection Agency of Beijing, for example, approved a “five-year clean air plan” in 2012 for a total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As the Director of the Transport Pollution Control Department of the Municipal Bureau for the Environment of Beijing Lee Kunsheng said, the main goal of the five-year-old is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (now 5.2 million), and to increase the use of fuel per vehicle by no more than 5 per cent.
According to the agency, transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme include limiting the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for motorowners.
Among other measures, the city's “green quinquennium” measures include the accelerated shift from the rest of the country to Euro-standards, the introduction of local eco-standards and the marking of motor vehicles and fuels, the restriction on the entry of motor vehicles into the central part of the city, the ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programmes to replace old motor vehicles with hybrids or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service vehicles), and the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Peking's auto-innovation also includes the ban on all private motor vehicles to travel within the 5th transport ring (in total in the capital of the PRC they are six) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle license plate), as well as the issuance of lottery-based car registration cards (e.g., in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of private car registration permits in Beijing was only a third of the number in 2010).
According to the current public programme “Environment 2012-2020”, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution is expected to drop to 128 (in 2012 it was 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011 “moving sources” accounted for 41 per cent of all urban air pollution.
In Moscow, for example, car emissions are ten times higher than industrial emissions, and in St. Petersburg nine times higher.
The Russian Federation is just beginning to reflect on the possibility of limiting car regulation in the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy, considers that administrative and fiscal measures to suppress the demand for road trips are known to be unpopular and can be taken by the community only if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, with two clusters that are weakly sensitive to any regulatory effects - office and personal vehicles, as well as vehicles of “privileged” users, with a total of at least 200,000 (about 5 per cent of the total of the Moscow fleet).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study analysing the balance of urban areas between housing, road cover and the number of motor vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers are that the centre of the city is provided with half the required roads, and most motorists in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods in parking or on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build car vaults rather than to expand the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly to pedestrians) and to limit the use and location of private transport within the area of the security area of the historic centre (the total area is about 3,212 hectares, covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unsanctioned street trade in Vologda will grow a little bit.
According to the city authorities, an increase in fines would help to clean up Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
The majority of street traders do not pay taxes, the products they make are often not subject to appropriate sanitary controls.
This means that the health of the wetlands is at risk.
For example, the lower limit of the fine for unauthorized trade will be sixfold from November, from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles, reports to the press service of the Vologda Authority.
Goldman Sachs warned of the risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is above all a crisis of non-payment for unsecured consumer credit and a massive contraction of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of that growth.
In recent times, it is entirely due to consumption, which is almost non-reducing,” said the Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs for Russia, Clemens Grate, presenting yesterday’s quarterly report of the Invest Bank on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal increase in wages in Russia is about 10%.
With 6% inflation, it will be able to generate future consumer demand at about the current level, expected in Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russia’s companies is falling, so it is likely that they will focus on optimizing staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages rise by 10 per cent, GDP by only 2 per cent, Mr. Grafé explained.
Companies have experienced a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow up, it may result in dismissals and an increase in unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise wages, commenting by the Chief Economist Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS, Vladimir Pantushin.
Unemployment is close to historical minimums, and the competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise their salaries to lure out or to keep the current ones.
Consumption in Russia is also a very rapid increase in the demand for credit.
In the view of Mr. Grafé, this type of credit does not have a multiplicative effect on the country ' s economy due to the very high rates of consumer loans.
"The benefits to the economy from the increase in the demand for credit have not been seen, the money is not diverging from the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is that Goldman Sachs is looking forward to an increase in unsecured loans.
They're mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide for.
The interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more often,” said Mr. Graf.
So the second threat to the growth of Russia’s economy is a possible non-payment crisis on unsecured credit.
The Director of the World Banking Institute, Vasili Solodkov, is already seeing signs of an emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the low-cost resources available to State banks, have been forced to attract high-interest public funds.
In response, the State Banks went on the path of war and began to lower their lending rates, and the economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot lend to the same interest, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the State Banks do not give up dumping, Russia faces a full-blown banking crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes.
Withdrawal of licenses by a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist has been a harbinger of mass collapse.
“The State Banks themselves will not be able to cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed to deal with the system crisis,” warns the head of the Institute.
But the increase in consumption will slow down, and without a crisis of non-payment, is believed to be in the Invest Bank, due to the failure to index the salaries of civil servants and the military, which is in the current version of the budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by lower inflation).
But only in part: if the investment does not grow (and the precondition is not yet - see the certificate), the growth in consumption will still slow down, confident of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin of the Barclays Capital has yet to see the preconditions for implementing pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a drop in the price of oil," he says.
He estimates that Russia's economy will begin to contract at a cost of less than $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the BC is not yet in a position to lower interest rates in the economy.
The paradox is that inflation has declined and the banks have begun to raise their stakes.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB, which announced a shift to the rate of inflation,” said Clemens to the Count.
The central bank's interest policy does not affect market rates, but only inter-bank lending rates.
"For the CB is the failure of all hope," Clements the Count.
Money obtained at CB auctions is not used by banks to credit the economy but to manage their liquidity
Once the rate drops, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go into speculation against the rouble.
“Either way, the BC will realize that this strategy is not working,” said Mr. Grafé, and recalled that the State is planning to put the ruble on “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But it's either going to have to do it sooner or raise the key rate of the CB (5.5%), he thinks.
According to his estimate, the ruble is now artificially overstretched by 10%.
There's only one way to weaken, the expert concludes.
But if the CB drops a shadow of doubt in the financiers that putting an end to the currency corridor is not a part of the policy of weakening the rouble, it can bring down the rouble much more.
The second South Ural Congress was held in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum will mark the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The congress was attended by delegations from all the cities and districts of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, the legislature and the executive - a total of some 350.
The Forum ' s course is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences or differences.
We live in a complete understanding,” states Feofan, the Mitropolitan of Chelyabin and Zlatoustov.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the promotion of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
At the end of the convention, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theater.
An exhibition of ethnic and cultural associations in the Chelyabin region was opened.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on the US intelligence issue
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence debugger, said that he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about his activities.
German deputy Hans-Christian Strebele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, who had been presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to view dissent as treason and is seeking to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that do not offer any protection.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community might convince the US Government to drop the criminal charges against him.
Allegations brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of public property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible.
The relationship between the United States and Germany became strained after the claim that the NSA was tapping the phone of chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, the MP who heads the Parliamentary Intelligence Unit, said that if there is an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, “not putting him at risk or destroying his relationship with the US completely”, it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, a member of Parliament from the Party of Green Germany, published his picture with Mr. Snowden on Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebele said that, according to the lawyer of the former contractist of the NSA, Mr. Snowden would not have been able to return to Russia had he left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need to be assured that he would be there “in safety,” said the MP.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global reaction to “his political expressions”.
Citizens all over the world, as well as high-level officials — including in the United States — found the discovery of an uncontrollable surveillance system useful to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge for a hand-deposit
Frontier Airlines is planning to charge the passengers up to $100 for carrying a hand-load on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a hand-held store and $2 for a coffee or a soda, even though their ad on Wednesday said that the passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new hand-deposit fee applies to the bags in the upper baggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said she'd be charging $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travelers were to pay only when they landed.
Frontier's representative Kate O'Malley said that a $100 fee should make the passengers take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it," she said.
Airlines started charging for the first and second bag in their luggage in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these charges fill as much as they can into a hand-held box in the upper baggage compartments, which often lacks space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection is not really about making money.
The fact is, the most loyal Frontier clients claim that it is getting harder to find a place in the upper baggage compartments.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one person in line at the front of the Frontier flight can be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next person in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change in the procedures on the website and on the Frontier logs is to guarantee that the passengers will know about the collection before they get to the landing.
The new Frontier collection for the handheld will not start till summer, although the date is not yet set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of baggage costs money, and the passengers who need it must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges to be a sign that airlines collect enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them, however, did not deal with hand-deposit charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand-load fee three years ago, and another Allegiant Air Discounter later followed her example.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the extra charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the fee for hand-held deposits is 50 million dollars a year.
Sorensen, the former top manager of Midwest Airlines, had recently flown on the Spirit flight, and he was curious what he would find at the exit of the landing when the passengers encountered an unusual collection of Spirit by hand.
“The landing process was the smoothest I've ever seen in my airline career,” he said.
I was expecting to see a brush of teeth and a fight on the way out of the landing.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went fast."
Frontier also follows Spirit for a fee of $2 for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who received soda or juice could keep the whole can and that the coffee spill would be made available free of charge.
She's still giving out free water.
US Airways for a short time tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused to do so seven months after the passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed her example.
The Frontier initiative to pay for a hand-deposit when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is the last step in bringing clients to their website.
Airlines pay online tickets, like Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than to contact an online travel agency.
But Frontier went beyond everyone in this area.
In September, it began to give half the bonus miles of a frequent flyer to clients who had bought tickets via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the bonus number of miles to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from the Frontier from an online travel agency would make it possible to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown, Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming a loss.
The profit fell by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities fell by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sales.
The NSA blames the "internal error," not the hackers for shutting down the site
The covert National Security Agency announced on Friday night that the shutdown of their website for a few hours had caused a technical failure, not a hacker, as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not available for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that occurred during the planned update,” the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
Allegations that the disruption was caused by a distributed “default of service” [DDoS] attack are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA site had not been in operation for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Previously, a representative of the NSA reported to ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency was “not at all” hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the representative reported.
At least one online group of hackers claimed that it was responsible for decommissioning the NSA website by means of a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to fill the target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is disabled.
Hackers' tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to infiltrate the inner target system.
Previously, the super-secret NSA, once named "No such agency," has been at the centre of public attention and critically critical in recent months, following a series of discoveries of its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and within the country, all of which are reactions to the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and published by a disillusioned former NSA official, Edward Snowden.
The growing debate around the agency has led to an interpretation that today's incident was the result of targeted action by hackers.
Bombardier's return is lowered by the drop in supplies and the number of plane orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent decrease in net profits on Thursday, as a result of the reduced number of orders and deliveries in the third quarter and the contract problems in its rail unit.
Nor did Bombardier, a company based in Montreal, publish any data on the flight tests of its most recent CSeries, nor did it provide new information on whether the ambitious plans for the commercialization of the aircraft would be implemented by the next September.
After the first flight of a pilot model of the aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, raising questions as to whether the test was on schedule.
The results did not meet the projections and led to a drop of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his rating on Thursday from "higher-market" to "medium-market" due to the belief that the stock growth was limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in the number of aircraft was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed at the performance of the transport department,” said Doerksen in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries will allow it to take a place in the lower market segment, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot aircraft was presented in March and first flew in September after months of delay.
However, the CSeries firm orders are not yet high - 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to test the company's allegations of fuel efficiency and the potential cost-effectiveness of the new ship.
A total of 403 orders and arrangements are in place with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director, Pierre Boduan, was confident that the Bombardier would reach its target of 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft was launched for commercial use.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward on the plan.
“The pilot model did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Boduan said during the telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software upgrades had been planned for the duration of the fixed-wing flight.
All manufacturers plan the tests in different ways.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break on the update, and that's what we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test programme.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks, and the rest will follow soon, according to the company.
Still, analysts are sceptical about the claim that the first client will be able to start operating the CSeries flight 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it was assessing the date of entry into service and would provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight tests, although likely consistent with Bombardier's internal schedule, supports our view that the entry into service will be carried over to the first quarter of 2015,” said Dorksen.
In the third quarter, which ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents a share, from $172 million, or 9 cents a share, last year.
The adjusted profit for the share remained the same, at 9 cents.
Gross income fell slightly, from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, which was less than the previous year's figure of 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26.
The Air Space Division order portfolio was $32.9 billion as at 30 September, with no change since 31 December.
“In the area of space, the results were in line with our objectives, but the low number of orders received and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor,” Boduan said.
The gross income for the aeronautical field fell by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train producer, reported that the gross income in the sector had increased by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit was $32.6 billion as at 30 September, a bit higher than on 31 December.
The revenues of the transport unit have been adversely affected by problems in the implementation of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier, who also announced that the Chief Financial Director of Google, Patrick Pichet, would be on the board, fell by 8.5 percent, to C$4.83, at a tender in mid-Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest rival Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony's counting on a lower annual profit
The Japanese electronics producer, Sony, completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, shortened the profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
The Sony results from July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected, owing to the drop in demand for TV, video cameras, and the Japanese company's personal computers.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter made the company's first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell back to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese market for consumer electronics is going through a difficult time, especially because of the declining demand for TV.
And while competitors try to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s major rivals, Panasonic, has recently shifted the focus on industrial components: the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, particularly through automotive systems and clean technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to make 179 billion yen of operating profit against the expected earlier 230 billion yen.
According to Thomson Reuters, this figure was expected to be much higher, to be 221 billion yen.
In an effort to emerge from the crisis, Sony expands the food line.
In the middle of this month, sales of smart watches were announced from a Japanese company with a number of fancy functions that would remove the need to remove a smartphone 100 times a day from its pocket.
After Sony lowered the annual profit and profit forecast, the company's shares lost more than 11% at the opening of the torogs in the morning in Tokyo, down to a level of 1668 yen per share.
The gene of speech turned out to be a stimulant for the formation of synapses.
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have found a protein that makes the "gen of speech" Foxp2 function by stimulating the formation of new neuron links.
The study is published in Science, and the magazine's website contains a summary of its content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by the identification of families of a number of people who could not speak the right words and sometimes even understood each other.
Scientists found that the Foxp2 gene had been disrupted by family members, but how it performed its function was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their functions is Foxp2 as a stimulant for the formation of new synapses in the brain-related speech.
It does this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered by the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2 shining for its activity.
What SRPX2 really has to do with the sounding, scientists have confirmed in an experiment on mouse.
When the animals were artificially lowered, they were less likely to scream when they were separated from their mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the sound was restored.
In the past, the mouse also showed a link to the vocalization of Foxp2.
The animals that had been injected with a human copy of the gene were eating more and more at a lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, therefore, the SRPX2 it manages are linked to the pure “mechanical” properties of the formation of sound or more delicate processes.
A cocaine-addiction lawyer who alerted the head of the criminal gang to a police investigation was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Diett gave information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be solved.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Royal Liverpool Court.
Precious counsel, who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid to expose his secret drug addiction, was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Diett was passing to the criminal authority Neil Scarborough secret information about his drug-trafficking investigation after he was at risk because of his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bash, who had been called a “cool lawyer” among the criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police operation to monitor Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
The officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarborough left three packets of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn County, Lancashire, while he was at the bar association's dinner with his colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Diett was “regulously using” a class A drug after the tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
During the eight-month period from January to August 2011, he sought illegal information about the arrest of two persons on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at that time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Merciside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police had seized in a series of raids of heroin and cocaine valued at £1.5 million, as well as over £200,000 in cash.
42-year-old Dietta was handing out information to criminals for fear that his coke addiction would be solved.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court of Diett, who works for the Forbes Solicitors Legal Company, based in Blackburn, was stigmatized after he was found guilty in two cases of wilful obstruction of justice following a three-week trial in the Liverpool Court of the Crown.
He confessed to possessing cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer was exposed after the police investigating Scarborough found out that he had regularly spoken to Diet on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and found him coming up to Diet's house in Blackburn and putting 60 percent clean drugs in the black golf glove under the lawyer's trash cans.
Shortly after the transfer of Scarborough, he had a number of calls with Diet, who was at a dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine talks took place between them.
The court found out that Diett was “regulously using” cocaine after the tests found traces of a Class A drug in his hair, wallet, and his credit cards.
Dietta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “lawyer's secret”.
At the time of his arrest, Diet took his wallet and tried to remove some credit cards, but all of them had been confiscated, and a sample of his hair had been taken from him.
At the police interview, he said that, in addition to the work place, he had a home office and clients had come to his home on legal matters.
However, the court learned that, after important arrests, he had called the largest drug traffickers, a number of whom he had previously represented in court to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
In an indictment speech, Ann White said, "If anyone knows that they should not break the law, it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dietta is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal counsel, as he has become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
This, however, far exceeded the limits of the normal relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow those individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dietta did not respect his profession, but shamed it.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, to question his interest.
Diett did not plead guilty and said, "If I had been a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and I would like to convey the information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the meeting, Chief Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police stated: "Mr. Dietta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as he began to buy drugs from organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine had made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the main members of criminal gangs, who had instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Dietta betrayed that trust and tried to cover his profession.
The investigation of Mr. Diet was led by the Sri Lankashire unit for particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage and now to obstruct justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve fair punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
An additional 35 persons involved in the fraud had been sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Dietta organized a question-and-answer conversation, in which he said that his dream work was a lawyer representing American clients with a death sentence, the perfect companion for him at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and motivation for work was inequality.
The Stadium in Jaroslavla was not ready to receive 22,000 viewers, and the police officers who were present at the meeting of the FRF today.
The ticket programme is, in their view, about double that.
During the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup with Spartacus, only a thousand stewards were engaged, with a standard of nine thousand.
Spartakov's fans had 2,200 seats, 10 percent of the stadium's capacity, but, in agreement with the Moscow Club, they had sold 5,000 tickets.
This information was read by the head of the KDC, Arthur Grigoriantz.
Americans overheard Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, a member of the United States security services, who had chosen not to reveal his name, said that the States had overheard telephone calls from high-level Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that there are a number of audition points in the country of the rising sun.
He noted, however, that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States did not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
This, he said, was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite its post-war alliance with Americans, is a target for intelligence, and CNK has reported.
None of the parties has yet formally commented on this information.
Recall, the news of US Special Services following the German chancellor came up last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA may have tapped Merkel's phone for the last 10 years.
The chancellor himself, according to some accounts, took the news of her wire very painfully.
She said that the allies she considered to be in the U.S.G. and the U.S. for decades, such surveillance of the head of government was unacceptable.
In the meantime, Edward Snowden said that he was ready to share details on the wiretap of Angela Merkel's phone calls with the German prosecutor's office.
The German specifically flew to Moscow to meet a former member of the CIA.
Bashkiria can put the grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria, in the course of public procurement interventions, may put grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic, Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales to the intervention fund.
So far, the market price is higher, and that's the demand.
"Maybe the grain will be tendered after New Year's," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that in the current year the crop yields for the 2013 crop amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including 1.7 million hectares, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
For the 2014 harvest, 550,000 hectares (an increase of 105,000 ha over 2012) have been sown.
The area under winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and the face has remained at the same level.
There's no Brotherhood group in the MVD bases that Leps in the U.S.
The databases of the Russian militants of the Brotherhood, to which Washington listed the singer Gregory Leps, are not listed.
According to Interfax in the Russian Federation's law enforcement agencies, after reports of the United States Department of Finance's placing Gregory Leps on the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal Syndicate “Brother Circle”, all databases had been verified, but no such group had been found.
The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called “Russia Mafia”, which is said to be operating abroad, is considered by the security forces.
"Even in the very name of the "Bruder's Circle," there is an element of mystique, a hint of a secret bed.
"It's all very similar to a PR action," said the agency's interviewer.
On October 31, the U.S. Department of Finance announced that Arthur Badalian, Gregory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lilin, Sergey Moscalenko, Jacob Rybalski and Igor Schlykov had been placed on their control lists for membership in the Eurasian criminal syndicate.
The individuals on the list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered to be powerful members of criminal groups and who have been on the US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Gregory Lepps "is a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
At the producer center of Gregory Leps, they refused to comment on the United States charges against the singer, calling them "single."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama identified the Brotherhood Syndicate as a “substantial transnational organized criminal group” and instructed the Minfin to “destroy and prevent their global criminal operations.
Putting a person on blacklists in the U.S. Minfine means blocking his assets in the U.S. and prohibiting business contacts with him by people living in the U.S.
Scandal video hit the police.
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and outright reckless actions, was caught smoking crack.
The Canadian City Police stated that it had videotape and was ready to open an investigation against the town commander.
He stated that he would not leave his post, and CNN reported it.
The information that the authorities have evidence of the use of drugs by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto Police website.
The head of the local law enforcement agencies, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the data with the public, but he was vouching for their existence.
According to Blair, Rob Ford's compromising video was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by the guards in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the Canadian press had written about the existence of the video, but until recently there had been no confirmation.
The mayor himself is not commenting on this.
He's just saying it's not his fault, and he's not gonna quit.
The police video is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend, Ford Alexander Licey, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal proceeds, and criminal collusion.
Sometimes Foxy was the driver of Rob Ford.
The people of the city have long been demanding the resignation of their mayor.
He fought with journalists on a number of occasions, appeared in public in a drunken form, and allowed himself racist and sexist speech.
OAO Rostovaeroinvest recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender by choice of the object designer.
The sum of the contract at Rostoaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the UAO Press Service, nine Russian and foreign companies took part in the competition, and the tender is to be prepared and sent to the State Expertise in spring 2014.
The winner will have to design a new passenger terminal at the airport, as well as infrastructure, internal roads and elements for the upgrading of the airport complex.
In the first phase of the construction, the inner area of the terminal will be 50,000 square metres, and it will be possible to expand it.
According to Rostoaeroinvest, the design document will take into account the prospects for the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to service about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was finalized, the architectural concept of the South Aeronautical Complex was defined and developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Donu and the rest of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen had a major project experience, the company had designed terminals C and E of the “Scheremetevo International Airport” and a new air station at the “Knevichi International Airport” in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport Complex will be built in the Aksai district of Rostov oblast and will replace the current growth of the South Airport, which will be closed down and eventually integrated into urban development.
The start-up of the aeronautical complex is scheduled to take place in 2014 and the installation of all the facilities is scheduled to take place in 2017.
A politician in Turkey declared a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began the construction of the separation wall in the area of Nusaibin in south-east Turkey.
The locals and representatives of the procuradian party of the MPA have been strongly opposed to the construction.
The Mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Ayshe Gekhan, on the border with Syria, launched a hunger strike protesting against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syria border, informed the RIA News in the Press Service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMP) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly dispersed the protest.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Muammer Güler, first denied the construction, then claimed that the wall was being built to secure the borders.
"The Mayor of Nusaibina Ayshe Gekhan, a member of the MRL, declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the wall into a deadly fight," said the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from one another, and the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhumane situation with which the Kurds will never agree,” quotes Ayshe Gekhan from the party.
According to the press, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is scheduled to take place in Nusaibin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set the rate of exchange for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the bolivar, in relation to the United States dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on 1 November, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange the equivalent of ten thousand United States dollars in a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the Bolivians purchased in the country at the time of their departure.
The specific rate of the bolivar vis-à-vis the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivarians per dollar.
In the black market, however, one dollar is estimated to be 57 bolivarians.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, Venezuela's inflation rate was almost 50 per cent.
The Minister of Oil and the Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, stated on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to the informal information that the agency had given, Caracas could still decide to lower the rate of the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of containment of the prices of products and goods of general consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a shortage of a number of products and to the operation of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
The director of Surrae, Andrei Belmach, noted that it is still hard to tell how long it will take to find a new Chief Trainer.
This post became vacant after Sergey Shepelev's resignation.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to tell you how long it's gonna take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, - it's an ITAR-TASS word for Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking at all possible options.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find some coach, but a guy who's been working at our club for a few years and getting some results with him.
The Kenyan press is resented by the provocative media law
“This is a frightening place, and there is reason to ask, ‘What can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?’
“This law is very strict and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, manager of the Capital Group, a parent company of Capital FM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and a news site.
He said that the new media court “will always be biased, as it is a continuation of the government” and limiting content and advertising will harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
“I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law will in fact allow the government to “make the media a dead grip,” while The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “were hit hard,” and criticized the bill as “draconian.”
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to enhance national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate mall.
The Kenyan media had angered the authorities by broadcasting surveillance videos, where the troops who had been sent to the scene of the attack allegedly ransacked an expensive mall.
David Kimayo, the Chief of Police, reacted by calling two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled following mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists can be fined up to one million, with an additional risk of being “excluded from the list,” i.e., being prohibited from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the perpetrator if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyse most FM radio stations.”
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called live blogosphere.
Politicians realize that by making the media shut up, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote a journalist named Nation Mutuma Matthew, characterizing the Kenyan media as a key source of inhibiting and balancing forces in public life.
“The politicians themselves will ruin the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the cuts appointed by the National Wages Commission and to restore their huge salary, which is about 532,000 shillings per month, without tax, one of the highest in the world.
A new cost line, a contribution to the major maintenance of the home, will be introduced in the royalty payments.
By the most approximating estimate, a standard two-room flat will have to be paid between 100 and 400 roubles a month from the new year.
The exact standard will be determined by the Government of the region.
But when you paint the driveway, fix the staircases, or even replace the elevator, it's up to the tenants.
This law was approved by the deputies of the Regional Duma.
Wladimir Kharnikov, president of the Voronesh Regional Duma, said: “In this case, too, it is necessary to put order in order - to prioritize the renovation of houses, to collect funds from non-governing companies - which are often registered with us in Moscow, in Orenburg, or elsewhere, it will be the establishment of State control over the expenditure of the funds that the inhabitants collect for the renovation of multi-family houses.”
Under State control, construction is now a shareholder.
A law that protects against frauds has been approved in final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,500 people have been affected by dishonest developers.
The problems of the majority have been resolved.
By the way, the new law sets out the rights and obligations of all participants in the construction.
Vladimir Kharnikov, president of the Voronez Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that the same abuses have begun in this area, due to the fact that, in the '98, the same money-dollars fell, and in the 2000s the same money-dollars."
People started to make money to cover the loophole, including by adopting the two laws.
Under Voronesh, it was decided to construct a temporary centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation.
The Regional Parliament had adopted such a law not only under the pressure of the Federation.
The problem of illegal migrants in the region is even more acute.
In the past year, for example, migration had been recorded by just over 100,000 foreigners.
But only one out of five has formalized a work permit.
Where the rest of us work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Krysnikov, president of the Voronesh Regional Duma, said, "They broke the law, but are not criminals."
There's no court, and you have to deport them. You have to keep them somewhere.
The Federation decided that regional funds should provide such space.
In the Voronesh region, it is the Old Olshanka district of Semeluk.
Well, lastly, the Regional Parliament has given new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families with 5 or more children are completely exempt from transport tax.
The budget in this case is about 3,5 million, but the same amount of money is saved by parents with many children.
Second, and most importantly, those who adopt 3 or more babies will be granted housing subsidies from the new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
A family, for example, of 6 people - the father, the mother, the birth child, and the third - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State buys a total of 108 square metres of housing for 3,300,000 roubles.
For the left bank or the southwest suburb, it is an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the center.
Baumgertner is nominated to the board of directors of Uralkalia.
The current UAO Board of Directors, Uralkalius, has nominated the arrested Director Vladislav Baumertner in Minsk for the new board, and is available on the website of the Russian company.
Bamughertner is on the list of 11 persons nominated to the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for the Extraordinary Shareholder Meeting on 29 November, at which a new board of directors will be established by a vote.
He is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
At the time of his arrest in August this year, he was charged with abuse of official powers.
Later, however, the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, at a press conference, stated that the charges against Baumgertner had been classified as "theft."
The porter of the oil industry, Matt Dalton, refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the position of mentor of the lowlanders.
Golkiper believes that Acting Chief Coach Dmitri Balmin enjoys a great deal of authority and will perform his duties.
Let's remind you, today, the Naphtechemist resigned Creekunov.
Frankly, I don't want to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, quoting Dalton RIA's "News."
I can only say that Dmitri Balmin will live up to his responsibilities - I have no doubt about that.
In the team, he has a lot of authority, and this young professional is definitely looking forward to a big future.
Leonardo Bonucci, the advocate of Juventus, will not help the team in the next Italian match with Parma.
According to Football Italy, the coach's headquarters decided not to include it in the game's application to save it before the 4th round of the League of Champions with the Real.
Nor will they take part in the match with the "Parma" of Lichtsteiner, Vucinich and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Quillarella recovered from the trauma and was ready to play.
A tax manoeuvre that increases the Mining Tax (PRI) on oil at the same time as export duties and accents increase will drive the fuel.
In the view of the experts, these measures may add 619.3 billion roubles to the budget.

U.S. Secretary of State: Special Services have sometimes come too far in data collection.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that the U.S. security services sometimes “came too far in collecting data and wire,” but the politician noted that the media’s record of 70 million people being wired was not accurate.
I assure you that innocent people have not been harmed in this process, but there was an attempt to collect information.
Yes, in some cases this went too far and wrongly.
I admit it, as the President also admits... and we will make sure that it doesn't happen in the future,” quotes the Secretary of State of the AFP.
Italian workers with seniority pass the way to the young
Italian unemployment beats the record.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the country's population is now unemployed.
So bad has not been the case since World War II.
Among young people, the rate is several times higher.
40.4 per cent of the population aged 15-24 is unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
The country's largest energy company is already implementing this experiment, and the laws that have been adopted allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for long-term employees.
On the other hand, Italy is looking forward to the common problem of the ageing population for Europe.
And economists are not sure that the premature rotation of human resources will justify itself.
The result of the construction of the TPK in Moscow
Over the next year, the capital authorities promise to set up more and more transport/transition hubs (TPNs).
It is planned that 255 TPNs will be in operation by 2020.
What the project is really about was our correspondent.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence broke out at the Smolenskaya subway of the Arbatsky-Poblholine.
The inscription said that the transport hub was in the process of being refurbished.
This was all very strange, as no ground transport stops next to Smolenski and therefore cannot be moved to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, we have to travel about 130 meters, including a ground crossing the Carmanica alley.
Smolenski's almost finished now.
After the flower bar, the paper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt was replaced by a bar bar before the entrance.
That's the whole transport hub.
Transport hubs are flat and capital, explained in the press service of the Metropolitan Department of Transport.
There are no capital TPs yet.
And the flats involve the construction of parking spaces, the removal of commercial objects that hinder the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms, and improvements.
In fact, flat TPNs are not even used by transporters, but by professional service providers from the major maintenance department of Moscow City.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design, explains the Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes a roof over the head and a placard are enough to indicate the time of arrival of the transport.
For example, the subway "Yasenevo" has recently opened up a fully-fledged flat transplant hub.
Let's have no curtains, but with interceptive parking spaces and placards that indicate when the bus arrives.
But in the pursuit of the number, the officials record everything in the TPU.
As early as 2011, the City Hall had planned to build all 151 knots, of which 59 were capital-built.
There are now as many as 255 TPNs in the planning for 2020.
Of them, one and a half are promised to turn in this year.
Although the city has a programme for the development of the TIP, no quality criteria have been set, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization City and Transport.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transplants is often deteriorating.
In the expert ' s view, there should be two criteria: first, a reduction in the time of transplantation, secondly, comfort.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without coming out in the rain.
In Moscow, however, TPUs sometimes go the exact opposite.
A bright example of the U.S. subway.
In the past, suburban buses from the Yaroslav Highway had been in the square in front of the main entrance to the OCE.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka to the street of the Cosmonauts.
Farther from the subway, farther from the monorail, but closer to the home.
In fact, the people did not want a bus station under the windows and complained to every possible authority.
With the capital TIPs in Moscow, it didn't work out right away.
The first of them started building five years ago at the Planetary subway.
The project was intended to be a model.
And indeed, we have a model of how the transfer hub, which is being repaid to investors, turns into a banal shopping centre.
No, there are railroads for the buses, a curtain to keep the subway out of the rain, and three floors of parking.
True, the chemical trollbuses No. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow TIP did not have a place in principle.
They've been taken away as strangers from the subway.
But there's more room for trade.
It's just 32 shops, and there's almost all of them, from the zoos to the car park.
Well, what if any of the bus passengers need to buy a new car on the road?
We always have a shopping center when we're building a capital TP.
The situation had recently reached its logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot had decided to go to the market.
Now, on the third floor of the "Planerny" TIP, there is a slaughter trade among the parking spaces on the floor.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech, and guards who look mean at our photographer.
The transfer knot has finally become a market.
The thing is, the subway used to have a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the merchants were spared and let into the interceptive parking lot of the transplant hub.
Still, because of high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was demolished to build a new flat TP.
That's the rocking.
On the subway "Caluja" the distance from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov.
Since the construction of the mall, the distance has allegedly increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the mall.
After 10 o'clock, when it's closed, you have to go around it in the open.
However, the designs on the "Planer's" and "Caleuc's" will soon appear to be flowering.
In mid-September, the Town and Land Commission of the City Hall approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPNs.
Four of them will be 25-story, with the exception of two or three subterranean latitudes.
The main monster will grow up at the Tusino subway, and it will have 418.7 thousand square meters of land.
The representatives of the railway station directorate of the RZD, responsible for the construction of the TSP on the subway, have already told the reporters that future multi-storey sites will be located in shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials say that multi-layer parking is a third to half of the land area.
Take, for example, the public garages.
Let's say the 258-way garage that was recently built on International Street has an area of 8,015 square meters.
So it's gonna take about 80,000 squares to park for 2,600 cars at the Petrovsko-Roomovskaya.
It's less than a third of the stuff that's going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go to all the bus fronts.
There are at least 150,000 square meters of commercial real estate left.
And this, for a moment, is almost two GUMs.
If the capital TIPs at stations and stations are built by railroads, the rest of the sites will be mastered by metropolitanians.
They also promised that there would be a lot of "functional facilities", including hotels, offices, and even gyms.
By the way, the Moscow Department of Property has recently told journalists that a draft decree is being drafted to allow investors to apply directly to the officials for a TIP site.
No contests.
Because it's said that transport is a priority for the city.
The perfect TIP is, for example, the Harvard Stations in Boston or the Spades Station in Toronto, I'm sure Alexander Morozov.
There the trolleybuses and trams go down to the subway level and the distance from the subway to the tram is only 50 meters away from the street.
There's no extra trade around.
But Moscow’s officials have been cast out in extremes.
Either we don't build anything, or we're gonna blow up 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser offers to treat as extremist the insult of patriotic sentiments
In order to legislate to protect the patriotic sentiments of citizens against the provocations and insults of the Fair Russia, it is proposed that the insults of patriotic sentiments be treated as extremist activities and punished for it by five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such legislative amendments, prepared by Oleg Miheev, Deputy Duma Energy Committee, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the Government for an opinion.
By the patriotic sentiments of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional relationship of a person to the country of which he is a national, characterized by love for the country, responsibility for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Miheev points out, domestic law punishes the abuse of the formal features of State authority, the flag and the stamp.
In the view of the Parliament, however, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be hurt and insulted by State symbols and other forms of disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently developed in Russian law.
As an example, he cites the debate that unfolds every year on the eve of Victory Day, when some mediamen allow themselves to question the heroic performance of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday, the Day of Victory, May 9th, a real vacanaly is unfolding every year.
By practising the wits and the "alternative view" of history, some publicists have come to the thought that, depressingly, it is a pity that the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I find this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the nation's main “spiritual crutch”, Oleg Miheev resents.
In addition, according to Miheev, there are far more patriotic people in Russia than there are religious people, but the law punishes insults to the feelings of the faithful, and the patriotic feelings can be insulted almost with impunity.
In the opinion of the national elector, it is necessary to equalize the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to prescribe a corresponding penalty in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for the punishment of insulting patriotic feelings, ranging from a fine of 100,000 to 5 years ' imprisonment.
An earthquake of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the area of Cokimbo in central Chile, and is being handed over by Reuters.
The area of the earthquake was 10.7 kilometers deep in the ocean and 54 kilometers southwest of the city, as explained on the website of the United States Geology Service (USGS).
It was recorded at 8:03 p.m. local time (3:03 p.m. in Moscow).
No casualties or subterranean destruction have yet been reported.
Let us recall that Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the world, so earthquakes are not rare.
One of the most serious was in 2010.
At that time, an 8.8 - magnitude earthquake and the tsunami caused by it had caused the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
Chile also had the most powerful earthquake in recent history, with 9.5 recorded in 1960.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitri Medvedev: the Greenpeace case will be fair
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, announced on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be dealt with in strict compliance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be handled in a manner consistent with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the law," said Dmitri Medvedev at a meeting with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French national.
Pierre Pisanne, like the rest of the activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
"I have asked if we can expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quotes Mr. Ero's RIA News.
“Our country cannot support activities that may harm the environment, nor can anyone break the law,” Dmitry Medvedev said.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including the extraction of energy, are dangerous.
He stressed that the facilities “as a gunpowder barrel” and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, were transmitting the RIA News.
UN Declares New Targets for Poverty Alleviation
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which had been formulated 12 years ago to overcome global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 MDGs, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio the night before.
They were included in the final document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said to the summit the night before that it was time to “go ahead of national interests”.
“I am glad that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and take control of the process of establishing the universal sustainable development goals, the SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the authority given to me by member countries to translate our vision of the sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of powerful people
Under the top-down image of Zamora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant the slogans of peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sussa, the executive director of an investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed the business suit to a shirt labeled “We demand security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Metropolitan Square of Independence.
Over the course of two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between Government forces and Renamo, one of the most brutal clashes since the truce more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, backed first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the South African Government of the apartheid era, in an effort to destabilize the country ' s independent Government.
After the truce in 1992 it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to relapse into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, as the opening of huge gas and coal reserves in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo Party have accused each other of the tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government was the source of the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala, the traditional siege of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times by Fernando Mazanga, a representative of Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for instigating the fighting, accusing the party of attacking the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to dispel fears of instability.
Hebuza said to AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday, that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a “successful man” who wanted to use “all that was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government.”
Both Frellimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fear grew after the report that Mazanga had declared Renamo ' s rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he was referring to non-compliance with the agreement by the Frelimo Party.
“Our aim is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease the tension that has been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two powerful men, Gebuza and Dhlakama, who ran into their foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University, and an expert in Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator or ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reform, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakening movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
Renamo's voting power has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza, who was due to resign next year, when his second term was over, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace, because he doesn't want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not clear what the capacity of Renamo is, but it has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key motorway from the north to the south.
Most of the skirmishes took place in Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of rail tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railroad.
Mazanga was evasive when he was asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo Party wanted “to alert the international community that Mozambique is not doing well,” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the dissatisfaction of the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development, and the recent increase in kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of an independent media company, Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the country's future lies with the Government and the President, who must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultuan, a protester, said that people just wanted stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelio, they just want to restart peace, they want free access to roads,” he said.
The "Art Mainstry" premiere series will be held in Moscow.
A series of "Art Mainstreet" films, in which the viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they are released, will be held at the Rollan cinema from 1 to 5 November, reporting to the RIA "News" with a reference to the project's organizers.
Opens the Art Mainstrim program by the French comedy of the director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at any cost."
This is the story of the Maya model in the French capital, itself Kerichi, who is being deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to the film, Kerichi will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean filmmaker Kim Ki-Duck "Mebius", the melodramatic bioipic Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: A Story of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of the May Cannes Film Festival "Life of Adele" by Abdelatif Keshesh.
The only Russian member of "Art Mainstry" will be Alexander Veldinsky's film "Geographer of the Globe oversaw" on the basis of the same name novel by Alexei Ivanov.
Constantin Habenski played a major role in the film, the charming loser-teacher Victor Servantkin, whose work was also marked by the award of the "Kinotaurus".
Children should learn myths and legends as “models of a way of life,” says the author.
The Torah accounts could show that “gross power can't beat subtlety,” and King Arthur’s legends show how important it is to have a dream.
By saying that many myths will be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach in schools,” Crossley Holland is in favour of “sudden selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I was in favour of introducing them to the curriculum for 20 years.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “would be of interest” to children, and that the basic ideas were “consolidated” in fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, and wrote "Norwegian myths" for Penguin and "British folk fairy tales," said, "You may have intentions, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps a big difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplistic or lead to a happy end, but it is essential that there be an innate understanding of right and wrong.
And it should be sublimated; it must be revealed through history, not clearly spelled out.
The old principle is to show, not to tell.
In Voronezhsk oblast, a football fan was arrested breaking the window in the station's waiting room.
At 9 p.m. on 29 October, at the Gryazi-Voronez station, the transport police removed from the passenger train two football fans from the Moscow region.
Upon going to the game of the team's favorite, the guys on the way got drunk on the train.
Young people were taken to the on-call section of the line office of the police station at the Gryazi station to draw up a record of an administrative offence.
There the fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police had inducted administrative material on them and released them.
The young men bought tickets for the next train, and at the station station they started waiting for it to arrive.
In the first half of the night, fans left the station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the front door window in the station's waiting room.
A transport police officer and a security guard of the CPR “RZD” roared at the sound of the broken glass.
They managed to arrest the intruder trying to escape the scene.
The employees of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation are being screened.
There is a question of initiating criminal proceedings, and a senior referencing of information and public relations to the South-East LU of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs on the transport of Sergey Olkhovik.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we're 15 years back.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his views on the riots at the podiums during the "Shinnik Cup of Russia" - "Spartake".
I am a supporter of all of this by the organizers of sporting events: clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we can see that they've taken a long stand.
They're waiting for someone to come out and clean up.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly the right one.
We should organize the fans, the clubs should invite their stewards, not let the business go off.
We have now developed a special government decree on the rules of conduct in the stadiums.
Once it's adopted, we'll get to the bottom of it.
But I'm sure I'll invite all the hosts of the football process.
I read an interview with Leonid Feudun.
State, say, quicker the law.
It's like the Bavaria fans in Jaroslavl are here and all set it up.
And we're outsiders.
In fact, it's terrible to see the podium watered out of the fireplace.
And it's in the country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're 10 to 15 years back," said Mutko.
Snowden can be interrogated in Russia
Edward Snowden, an ex-staff member of the United States security services, is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify on the telephone wiretaps of German chancellor Angela Merkel.
According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation can answer questions from the German Attorney General's Office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure out of Russia is virtually non-existent.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by US allies," said the agency's interlocutor.
“In addition, in principle, the Office of the Attorney General of the Federal Republic could send representatives to the Russian Federation or send written questions to Snowden”, the source added, adding that the matter should be addressed at the inter-State level.
A German Bundestag member, Hans-Christian Strebele, had previously reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the case of a wiretap by the United States Special Service for the talks of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
An ex-CIA officer has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although the U.S. NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But to do so, we need to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival,” said Strabel to the Euronews TV channel.
Snowden's counsel, Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement made by the source of Interfax, stated that his client could cooperate with the German investigators, but when and how he would decide on his own.
A U.S. citizen, Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he made public information about the United States' secret intelligence operations on Internet surveillance.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the United States authorities, who had in absentia charged him with serious charges, and remained in the transit zone of the Sheremetevo Airport until early August.
On 1 August, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a period of one year and left Sheremetevo on the same day.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren stated that his client had taken up a job in a "large Russian company."
Last week, the German media reported spying on the NSA on Angela Merkel.
According to the reporters, the Americans began to listen to the chancellor's phone calls as early as 2002.
The station was allegedly stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after publishing this information, claimed that the surveillance of Merkel was in violation of the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev left Fair Russia.
A member of the State Duma of the Fair Russia Party, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, submitted an application for withdrawal from a political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he applied to the party's New-Siberian Regional Office.
According to its statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the justices.
We're sitting, we're having tea...
"For some reason, a lot of people want to see the picture of "Ilya Ponomarev puts a ticket on the table," but it's not that epic," he commented.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained a good relationship with the regional essay office.
However, it is not his intention to give up the mandate of the Member of State Ilya Ponomarev.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and was legally unable to withdraw.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the Fair Russia Party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Gudkov and Valery Zubov would come out of the RS with him, but the latter soon denied the information.
Japan will discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia
The head of the Japanese MIDA, Fumio Kisida, met with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“Want to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of the political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty,” stated Kisid at the meeting.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan visited Russia, relations between countries had become warmer and more bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation would meet Japan in dealing with complex political issues, writing the RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed northern territories.
In that regard, there are protests in Tokyo today demanding the return of the land lost after World War II.
There are cars on the Japanese capital, from which they say, "Return the North!".
The police don't stop the protesters, they make sure they don't get any more noise.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It is bold to say that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago, the estranged artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conferenceer at the Palace Theatre theater on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational way.
The Faye's novel was eventually picked up by others, most recently the New York comedy festival.
Created and managed by Caroline Hears, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with over 60 shows in small clubs and big theaters.
“Most of these headlines started at the Carolines, and then made more success, to the point that they are already too famous to perform at the club,” said Hirsch.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes talks by Wanda Sykes, Cathy Griffin, and Bill Mara, as well as "Standup for the Heroes", an annual music comedian charities concert for war veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be among the hosts.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
A number of comedians participating in the festival this year gained their popularity in a non-conventional way, for example, through a show on small TV stations like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was famous for his role in a comedy show on a low-known cable TV channel (known as "Liga" on FXX on Fantasy-Football), and now hosts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation Zones", although it is best known for the series of viral videos "Marsel - a shell in boots".
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with their own style (surrealistic pessimistic Anthony Jeshelnik, a devious, racially focused Camau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the most prominent moments of the festival will be an interview between David Steinberg and Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in central Manhattan.
“This city is, of course, the central element of all Larry's work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes went out on some street between the two houses and thought, "If I'm not getting any money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities have begun talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun talks with the Taliban.
This was reported by the British Embassy, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British vice-president Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market, and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister has reported that the dialogue with the Taliban has begun,” states the statement of the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said he was hoping and praying for dialogue to work in accordance with Pakistan's Constitution,” the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Techic-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the same-named Afghan movement, but operate independently of it in the north-west of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had previously attempted to start talks with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would not negotiate unless the authorities took the troops stationed in the Taliban area to the permanent sites and released the imprisoned Islamists.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for a peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell to $96 a barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when alarms about the formation of large reserves overshadowed a message that China’s energy-intensive production sector was gaining momentum.
The United States’ standard oil class in December has been 14 cents less than $96.24 a barrel later in the European day in electronic tenders on the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract increased by 39 cents, which represented a 5.8 per cent drop in the October price.
The rich oil reserves have had an impact on the value of oil in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy announced on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels have been added.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, based on two reports of the Chinese industry that had shown an upsurge in its activity.
This indicates that China’s economic recovery may continue to grow after the third quarter’s growth rate has risen to 7.8 per cent after a 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brint's oil, a reference type of international oil, also used by US refineries, has increased by 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel at the London Intercontinental Exchange.
The Chief Trainer of Colorado, Patrick Roux, explaining the decision to release the Hollywood Semen Varlamov from the first minutes of the Friday match with Dallas, expressed his confidence that the recent night behind the bar had not shaken his confidence in the Russian, and was handing over from Dallas a subpoena to "SE" by Natalia Schmeleva.
And what do we have to wait for, said Rua after the morning roll "Lavin."
Of course, what happened to us all is a matter of concern, but we are sure of it, and we feel that it will be good for him to get out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his normal level.
So you're absolutely sure the situation didn't affect the gatekeeper's condition?
We'll see today.
There is no doubt that our players will support Warley by helping him guard the gate, as was the case in the previous games of this season.
The point is, no one on the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court has sorted out the situation.
In Siberia, you don't have to be a vegan: a warm tomato won't replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, the journalist RIA News found out.
People who have completely abandoned animal food must not live in Siberia.
They can't carry out the winter here without a health loss, and no warm tomatoes can compensate for it, so the vegan polled on the eve of Vegan's Day are the new-Siberian dietologists and doctors.
Drinking butter with liters
Strict vegetarianism, when not only meat and fish are abandoned, but also milk, honey, and eggs become a fashionable way of life.
However, dietologists believe that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia it is at least unhelpful to keep to such strict food standards.
The complete abandonment of animals is harmful.
Animal proteins contain non-essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate by plantation.
You have to have at least milk or eggs in your diet,' the dietist Marina of God is sure.
It gives an example of a fish that contains an irreplaceable omega-3 fatty acid.
The most rich vegetable oil he's got is linen.
"To consume it in the quantity needed for humans, you have to drink a liter," says a dietist.
Health professionals believe that Siberians need to pay special attention to the diet in winter.
Vegetarianism is particularly in question this season.
In the context of our reality, the food requirements are high.
You need an elevated calorie to keep you warm.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, therefore, he is inexpensive to this calorie," says a specialist.
The dietary doctor, Olga Poznjak, agrees.
She adds that the fruits and vegetables of the car are not the way out.
It is best for a person to eat mainly food that is grown in the region or where he was born.
The genetic code is geared to better absorbing and digesting these products.
And in winter, people don't want to ate a cucumber, but a hot soup or something sweeter,” the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, different grains, grains, beans, local vegetables, apples remaining in winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But it's definitely not enough to feed.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudius Arithulina, the vitamin levels in the Siberians are only sufficient from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete shift to vegetarianism in our harsh natural environment, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees in a day and the snow is lying in May, is incomprehensible.
The body needs energy to live, and this is, above all, fat,” the medical doctor observes.
Doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them defective.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and micronutrients on the menu.
"The vegans don't get it," I'm sure.
Arithula says that an adult is free to choose anything, "to play the toys he wants."
He's got a body, a skeleton, organs.
Still, children need to be fully fed.
If his parents deprive him of any micronutrients or amino acids by choosing for him what he's going to eat, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of some kind of substance to develop the brain, the vision, the bones will no longer be restored tomorrow," she says.
All the health professionals interviewed agree on the low quality of winter-growing in greenhouses and in-country vegetables and fruit.
What is brought to us and grown in the greenhouses contains less micronutrients than (growing) in the open ground.
"The quality of food is not the same," says God.
Arifulina also notes that the import and thermal vegetables and fruit are far from ideal standards.
At times, the willingness of producers to collect more crops is detrimental to quality.
"The apples don't get brown on the cut, the cucumbers are fast yellowing and molten, the tomatoes are tasteless and neuromatic," cites the example of the medics, adding that they are likely to be filled with an overcrowded amount of fertilizer.
And they don't make vitamins, they become cellulars.
The Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology Institute of Agrarian Problems, a Ph.D. of Vera Petruk, disagrees with this.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance with all the standards and requirements in the greenhouses, it was possible to grow full-scale vegetables.
If they try to get more from a square metre, they will certainly get more water and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilisers are growing rapidly, they are large but watery and watery,” she explains, adding that the quality issue depends primarily on the producer's conscience.
The court suspended the enforcement of the “stop-and-search” practice in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the enforcement of a court order requiring a change in the stop-and-search programme of the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the Second District of the United States stated that the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin ' s decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of the City ' s appeal.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution in the way in which he had carried out the programme of street arrest and interrogation.
The City filed an appeal against its decision and corrective action orders, including an order to appoint a supervisor to help the Police Department change the way it works and the related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a hearing of the parties on the motion for stay.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge had to be recused because she had violated the U.S. Code of Conduct and had not considered it necessary to avoid being biased, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court ' s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably resorting to blacks and Latin Americans on the stop-and-search programme.
It had appointed an external controller to monitor major changes, which included policy, training and control reforms, and had also decided to launch a pilot programme to test tele-contained videos in police stations where most of the arrests took place.
In August, New York decided to discontinue the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases had been closed after a police check.
The City ' s appeal is due to take place after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic was criticized by a large number of civil rights lawyers.
Stopping-search has been a practice for several decades, but the number of documented stops has dramatically increased under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin American.
In 2004, four people, all members of national minorities, filed a collective suit.
Proponents of the “stop-and-search” programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to bad practices, form a more reliable and effective police service, and can affect the way other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents claim that changes will lower the spirit of the police, not the level of crime, lead to unnecessary waste of money, and will not solve the more global problem of complex police conditions by lowering the number of officers by a few thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she was continuing the practice of “stop-and-search”, which was consistent with the Constitution, but was altering the way the New York Police stopped people.
In the area of the Tretikov Gallery, a pedestrian zone was opened
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretrovsky Gallery and occupies a section two kilometres from the subway station Novokuzny to the Bolt Square.
Over the course of the process, street torches, flowermakers, berries, urns and toilets, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been set up.
In addition to the Klimensky and the Lavrussian alleys, which had already been pedestrians, five streets had been closed for the cars - the Ordinsky Sack, the Great and Small Tolmachevski alley, the Kadashev Bay and the Bottom Square.
There is no limit to traffic on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka.
In the section of Friday Street, from the lobby of the Novokoznyskaya station to the Klimenski alley, the conditions for pedestrians have been created, without demolishing the traffic and cutting the carriageway, and they transmit newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone, the Tretikov Gallery, the Temple of the Martyr of Clemens of the Pope, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
In the past, the Tver Pass, the alley alleys and the Kuznetsk Bridge had become fully foot-paced.
The big Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened at the beginning of September, decided to close the car on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone hack to check a private message.
The former editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, allegedly used "the break-up of the phone, the surveillance and the confrontation" in an attempt to prove false information about the novel of Charles Clarke, who was then the Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, King Andrew Edies, informed the court of Old Bayley that in May 2005 the News of the World had received unreliable news that Clark was meeting with her “attractive special adviser” Hannah Polby.
The paper ordered private detective Glenn Mulkeyre to hack Paulby's voice mail and watch her outside to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages, and the court heard.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person to stand next to someone's home, hoping to catch someone by surprise, is the person who likes to offer a story to people to see what they're gonna say,” Mr. Edies said.
He said that the News of the World had used three ways to investigate stories: cellular hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hack?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The rumours of Clarke's novel first drew the attention of News of the World when the source who was sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A cassette of voice messages received from her phone at least three times was taken from the home of Mulkeyre in August 2006.
Investigators also found the records on the private detective's computer, in which Miss Polby and her sister appeared as "Projects".
During the period she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, said Mr. Edies.
At that time, former Chief Reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weatherrape monitored Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we're planning to publish tomorrow, which I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edies said that Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same scenario as other influential people, such as the former Minister of the Interior, David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blankett about an affair with a married woman while he had himself met with a co-defendant, Rebecca Brooks, who was at the time married.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack their phones from October 3, 2000 to August 9, 2006.
Mulkyre, Turlback, and Weatherrape have confessed to hacking their phones.
Snowden says he's ready to speak to the German authorities in the wiretap case.
C.I.A. Ex-staff Edward Snowden is willing to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany, to pass the RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA official to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday presented a member of the Bundestag, Hans-Christian Strebele, through which Snowden sent a message to the German authorities.
Strebel met Snowden the previous day in Moscow.
Four people were injured by a fire in Tver Street
As a result of the fire in a collector in central Moscow, on Tver Street, four passers-by were injured.
According to Interfax, with reference to the source in the emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-by was affected by a fire in a smoked underground passage.
According to RIA Novosty, with reference to the head of the Metropolitan Department of Fuel and Energy, Pavel Livinski, electricity is now fully rebuilt in all the houses on Tver Street.
The fire in the heat collector near home 15 on Tver Street took place on the evening of October 31.
There was a strong smoke out of the stormy sewer hatch, and a smoke was created in the underground passage at the Armania store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tver Street had been demolished.
At 9:45 a.m. Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
US cuts in food security for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
As of Friday, U.S. financial support for food stamps, known as "Foodstemps", has been declining since the end of the relevant government program.
A family of four will now be allocated 36 dollars less per month than before, according to officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, the benefit per person averaged $133 per month.
Food aid spending in the United States has increased to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans have relied on free food aid, which is provided by foodstamps, which has been named since the time when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis erupted, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts in the funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should be geared towards helping those who need it most.
The owners of food stores all over America are concerned that cuts will result in lower consumer spending.
U.S. congressmen continue to argue about how much more government funding can be cut.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform free of charge
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform on the PC free of charge.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game was made available on the "Battle.net" section of the classic Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can currently download it.
The game is not yet available for Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard had just released on the PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne Platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally entered the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants had been divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day, the Dark Ruler Sarlak decided to kill the Light King Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he went back to Tuul to fight Sarlak's collaborators and to protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its renaming as Blizzard Entertainment.
It was previously called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne's editor was Interplay.
There will be new machines in the Moscow subway.
But selling tickets to the passengers is not for money, it's for sit-ups.
One trip of 30 roubles will cost a potential passenger 30 secludes.
The number of sit-downs will be calculated by means of modern technology, reports ITAR-TASS with a reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first machine will be installed at the Exposition Station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of the new tickets, the president of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, and the Olympic champions Alexei Nemov and Elena Zhangichikov will be present.
Confessions by the National Security Agency reinforce corporate paranoia with regard to State surveillance
On a warm day late in August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
According to the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, his mission was to take a picture of the roof of the United States office, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media say that BfV was hoping to find the antennes of listening devices, and this action led to talks between the US and the German Foreign Office in Berlin.
James Clapper, the Director of the US National Intelligence, reasserts in September that the US does not use external intelligence to steal the business secrets of foreign companies in the interest of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or their profitability.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who has become a decoy, has begun to publish his treasure of U.S. intelligence, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure if the director can be trusted.
Reports that the United States National Security Agency had been following the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data stored by US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoia of the state surveillance corporations to new heights.
The last drop was to tell you that the cell phone of chancellor Angela Merkel had been tapped for about ten years.
If Europe’s most powerful person can become a target, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made it clear that there was intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it's possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grun, president of the BITMI association, representing German small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US is now facing almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a July study published by the EY Consulting Agency.
All of Mr. Snowden's disclosures, however, still had no evidence that the US had been handing over the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked some information technology and Internet capabilities, and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are sceptical about it.
Some in the German Parliament say we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software provider for the SAP business.
If there is a need for a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
Still, the scope and technical development of the US spy agencies, which had become known by Snowden’s revelations, was a shock to some companies that had previously thought that China was the most at risk of surveillance.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European managers have become more aware that the data held in the US are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American members refused to use the services of the US-based cloud service provider after exposing the American software for the intellectual analysis of Prism's data.
Jim Sneib, one of the CEOs of SAP, said, "We see that consumers are asking a new question that didn't come up a year ago, namely, where my data is stored, and if you can guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders claim that recent reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore they must be guarded at any cost.
What is happening in economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always been.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate,” says Kurt Bok, Chief Executive Officer of the BASF chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them too, because it is part of our national interest to protect our business.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about the reactions they have made, as this may give an advantage to the opponent.
The idea of taking a free drive at the show or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least unthinkable.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi Automotive Company, said that it had been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they could not be used as eavesdropping devices.
The Federal Office for the Defence of the German Constitution recommends that company managers consider the use of simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their particular niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” warns BfV.
The US warns its own companies of economic espionage from other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Report put France, together with Russia and Israel, in the second series of hackers who hack for economic intelligence after China, claims The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Scarcini, former head of the DCI, said in an interview this month: “The service is well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a young man in Georgia who died in a "famous accident" believe that their son was murdered
The parents of a young man from Georgia, whose body was found inside a rolled-up sport mat in the gymnasium of his high school, believe that their son had been murdered, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical mattress to the back of his high school sporting hall.
Investigators of the Loundes County Sheriff's Office have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old boy contests this.
“They are absolutely sure that their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com, Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he was dead as the sheriff said.
“They think it's against the logic, the laws of physics, and common sense,” Cramp said.
They think it's a cover to protect a person or people responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
American counsel Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into the death of Johnson, noting that a number of key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to look at all the facts, no matter where they go.
My goal is to know the truth.
“I am of the view that there are sufficient grounds” for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson had died as a result of "position asphyxiation".
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
“There are a number of issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to call for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to do it.
The Lones County Sheriff's Office was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to publish all the videos of the security cameras that the investigators had been looking at.
The teenager’s parents said that they hoped that the videos contained the key to determining how he died.
"Spartacus": For the information about the persons who hung up the fascist symbol
On the official website of Spartacus, a statement was made by the Moscow Club regarding the appearance of a fascist flag on the podium in Jaroslavla.
"On 30 October, at the Shinnik Cup game, "Spartake" by unknown provocators at the stadium in Jaroslavla showed fascist symbolism.
We call on all who have reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence to provide it.
"The reward is guaranteed," states the statement.
We're looking for fans who hung the Fascist flag in Jaroslavla.
In the 1/16 finals, the Shinnik Cup of Russia, Spartacus, was interrupted on several occasions because of the riots on the stands.
A fascist symbol was also shown in the Spartaka fans' sector.
In the form of punishment, Spartacus can hold about three games without an audience.
There will be a meeting of the Committee on Friday.
If you have any information on who put this symbol in and out, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on allergicity to children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in schools.
This is the first list of similar recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the incidence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The manual provides information to schools on how to raise the awareness of teachers and staff of food allergies among children and how to help with allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline reserves — most commonly used for injections by the EpiPen medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The state legislature has recently amended the regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline stocks with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children having an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "It's like something's sticking in my language," "it's like I have hair in my language," or "the language's pinching."
Parents of intersex children can choose “undefined sex”
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with an intermediate sex organ.
Newborns will no longer be required to be male or female.
The new law does not require parents to refer to any sex of such children by allowing parents to indicate gender as “undefined” or “unspecified” in their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to remove the pressure on parents who might rush to decide on a sex-appropriation operation and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later, "I am not a man or a woman."
I'm going to be a doctor-created patchwork with bruises and scars.
About one of the 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of some 60 pathological states that are diagnosed with “sexual disorders” — a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonades (juices or seedlings) or unusually developed external sexual organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still under-explored, but most experts in the US say that, if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and to attribute it to it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if any.
The New York Psychiater, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said that the new German law “believes as a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children do not,” he said.
You can take the floor without surgery and then see how the person is developing.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a puzzle about why people can be gay.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as being different from transgender or transgender, as their condition is not gender-related but their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but is typical of both at the same time or not.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sex, such as muscular mass, hair-cover distribution, breasts, and body structure; primary sex, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general picture of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and crime based on prejudice.
Boys with gender disabilities now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to put men, women, or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Walby, became the world's first man to be “genderless,” holding down the right to a life-long “unspecified” sexual status.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use the third mark in addition to M and F to X, i.e. intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also disagreed with the German law, saying that “in a situation where the world is drawn to a new state, where sex is the object of choice, and sexual activity is not, we are turning back two more pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn baby in Maryland also informed the Baby Zone website that she would have preferred to have sex at birth.
“It is hard enough to have a child without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,” she said to the parent’s website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sex organs have been called hermaphrodites, a beautiful Greek god who had the characteristics of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the health community viewed gender as a sheet that can be erased and painted again.
But now, many are challenging the ethical basis for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how a child will view the sex he or she has been given when he or she grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called an urgent psychiatric case,” Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist; you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to deal with intermediate genitals was offered by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that the signals of the environment, including the social — the way parents raise a child — interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would consider himself to be a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were in question.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during a negligent circumcision, to castrate the child completely, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors are still "applying this model."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these gender-change operations claimed to be “dissatisfied with the result.”
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY men's chromosomes, but mid-type genitals.
Doctors could not determine whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” for a man.
So, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external sex organ and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He started to have female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I was not a girl," he said to ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was given a vaginal job.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he demanded medical records.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sex disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genitals.
When he learned the truth, he became a man again, getting shots of testosterone and removing his boobs.
The operation made him sterile.
Today, he stands for others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersex.
But Ann Temar-Mattis, the executive director of the California Law Association of Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law “creates to label and stigma.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the baby an undefined sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will promote intervention.
We think it's best to take a male or a female and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Temar-Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law because “it allows adults to choose for the third sex”.
“People must be able to make their own decisions about formal sex,” she says.
The German law refers to her being aceted at birth.
This is a fight that small children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammologian in Pittsburgh, who has a sexually disabled daughter who is helping hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law would “support” both parents and children.
Barac's daughter, Cathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sex disorder called the "androgen insensitivity Syndrome".
As her androgen receptors are not working correctly, Cathy has developed a feminine trajectory.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Cathy is married and interns in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves,” Baraz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and to figure out the situation, as well as the time before they write "male" or "female".
In that case, you are fine — raising a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't have to rush into a surgery that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and removes the anxiety that drives parents because they don't feel like they're doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with, and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
The gateway to Chicago, Nikolai Habibulin, stressed that he had to play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of the Hawks, Habibulin first missed six pucks from the Tampa Bay, and then four from the Ottawa, and in the second game it was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I failed to do so, - quotes CSNChicago's word Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in the training, I think I should go to them like a game, and try to get a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training, I feel pretty good.
But for some reason, after a few heads, it turns out to be some sort of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a bit.
The gatekeepers - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to do the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what's happening in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself to keep the puck on.
It's good to have my clubmates back up, but basically it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games aren't the whole season, but I wanted to do them a lot better.
But it happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'm just gonna try to make the next match a better one.
A flight bus crashed on Altai.
In the Rubtsov district of the Altai region, the APC flight bus crashed.
As a result of the crash, 13 people were reported to the Regional Office of the MES, according to the updated data.
In the past, law enforcement authorities in the region reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred about 9 a.m. local time on the Newvonicolaevka - Vishnevka road, 1 kilometre from Novonikolyolayevka.
The bus from Rubtsovska to Vishnevka had 12 passengers and a driver, all of whom had been injured in varying degrees of gravity and hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to City Hospital No. 1 Rubtsovska, and two were hospitalized at the RBK Rubsovska.
Medvedev expects SSJ-100 to be flown to Europe
Russia expects Superjet 100 aircraft to be flown to Europe once they are in Latin America and Asia.
“We expect that in total we will receive such arrangements for more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type,” Interfax quotes Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev of Russia, who spoke at a press conference with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Marc Ero.
The head of the Russian Government noted that serious cooperation had been established with French counterparts, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once the aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he's ever going to go to France," stressed the Russian premiere.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by Civil Dry Airlines in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger spaces.
Dnipropetrovochia's energy has begun a unique program to save... the nests of the oysters.
In the old days, the villagers set up a wheel on a high stake to bring the oysters to the court, and the heavy nest held well on it.
These are no longer adjuncts, so the oysters have loved the poles of the power transmission lines - the interwoven branches are based on wires, so that the aystic home is secure.
Anja’s grandmother, whose home in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovsky district had been home for 20 years, began to notice how the nest was nesting despite the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds are putting new rags on top, and the lower layer is already lined between the wires is about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity for a family of oysters who nested at the roof every year, brought out and fed three or four chicks in the summer, but don't want to be left without light.
As soon as the birds left for the warmest terrain, Anja’s grandmother called the Czarician Reservoir, which owns the support.
I didn't even expect it to react that fast.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were astonished that the nest was still in place, said the Dnepropolenergo technical director of DTEC, Sergey Berezovsky.
On the wires, which were in fact already inside a nest weighing between 150 and 200 kilograms, corroded.
At any time, the birds could have been electrocuted.
And the locals risked losing light because of the damage to the wires.
So the liner monthers started the operation to save the nest, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from Dnipropetrov National University helped to develop a nest transfer scheme.
They also conducted training for district network staff.
Alexander Ponomarenko, a well-known ornithologist of the day, consulted the energy industry at all stages of nest reconstruction.
For starters, it was estimated that there are more than 50 atypical “stays” in the area in an emergency state.
Special metal platforms like a vortex have been made for their reconstruction.
The base was sprinkled with branches of oxen, and then the old nest was moved there.
In the view of the experts, it is sufficient to put the old branches as a basis for the birds to know the nest and return to it.
Then the storks will build their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was rebuilt in the village of Sandská in the Newoskovsky region.
A new iron concrete pole was installed next to the electrospray and placed on it a platform with an old, coated nest.
The whole operation cost 9000 hryvnia.
And the other day, the same house was held in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovsky district on the outskirts of Ani’s grandmother.
This is where the platform was backed up, just up above the wires.
Ornithologists believe that the cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their “ownership” has been majorly renovated.
By the end of the year, four more nests are expected to be rebuilt in the Pocharod and Czarichan districts of Dnipropetrovczyk.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others kill them ruthlessly.
The other day, the whole area was overflowing with the sad news that, in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolic Region, the day the pheasant hunt was opened, poachers shot down a swan family living on the local pond for entertainment.
The noble birds did not fear humans at all; the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying dead on the water.
The Apostolic Police Department is now investigating who shot the birds in the Red Book.
"Russian March" is getting more popular.
On 4 November, on the Day of National Unity, Moscow will be held in agreement with the Town Hall's "Russian March".
According to the Levada Center poll, the support for the Russian marches is on the rise, with 40% of the citizens approving it to varying degrees.
According to the Levada Center, 40 per cent of the citizens have different degrees of approval of the “Russian marches”: 11 per cent of them are definitely positive and 29 per cent are “promptly positive”.
The popularity of the “Russian marches” is gradually growing - in 2006, only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed it, and in December 2010, more than twice as many citizens (28 per cent) supported it.
“Definitely negative” refers to “Russian marches” for only 7 per cent of Russians, and “promptly negative” for 19 per cent.
Another 35 per cent were unable to express their views on the action.
This year, the Moscow City Hall agreed on a “Russian march” of up to 15,000 people in Lublino, which was reported today by the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majorov.
This nationalist action has taken place every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
In response to a question from sociologists, “Have you heard that on 4 November Russia is holding “Russian marches” under slogans to defend Russian rights in Russia?” Three quarters (75 per cent) of the citizens replied in the negative.
Only one in five Russians (20%) know about this action.
Significantly, in December 2010 almost one third of the citizens (31 per cent) heard about the “Russ marches”.
Three years ago, a natural nationalist rally took place on 11 December in Manage Square, which had become a riot.
The Levada Center also asked the Russians about the holiday of November 4.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (National Unity Day) rose from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
However, only 15 per cent of citizens are attending the festival.
About the same (17%) plan to celebrate November 7th Day of the October Revolution.
Most of the citizens (62 per cent) are not planning to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the Moscow City Hall agreed on the "Russian March" in Ljublino
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed on the holding of the “Russian March” on 4 November in Ljublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Russians, the organizer of the Dmitry Demushkin march.
In addition to the Ljublino march, a rally and the Corrot Rock Concert will be held on the Day of National Unity, also in coordination with the authorities.
How did "Russ Marsh 2012" go?
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, the nationalists marched from the Yakiman River to the Central House of the Artist, where a rally was held.
The organizers estimated the number of participants to be 20,000, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs referred to the figure of 6,000.
Message: Obama's campaign headquarters was considering the exclusion of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton.
According to The New York Times, the closest advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 election list.
This discovery is the most powerful sensation of the expected book by Mark Halperin and John Hailemann on the 2012 campaign "The Stats Doubled: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times had received a copy of the forthcoming book and announced on Thursday evening that the president's immediate assistants had conducted “large-scale studies in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether the exclusion of Biden could help raise the defunct hope for Obama's re-election.
According to political commentator The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by senior officials of the pre-electoral headquarters and the White House, the former head of the White House, Bill Daley, to assess the impact that the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as Vice-President will have on the vote.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded by the Chicago Election Office and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers — including Daley, the former head of Obama's electoral headquarters, Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisors, David Axelrod, and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book Doubled out claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden despite their “near personal relationship,” but eventually refused to do so when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not “make Obama’s chances significant. ”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I have been active in favour of considering a lot of things, and it was one of them,” said Daley to the paper.
You should remember that the president was in a terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what do we do?"
Although Daley described the study as a “necessary test,” Martin told CNN's representative Anderson Cooper that the pre-electoral headquarters had invested enough in the study of whether this step would produce dividends for the vote.
“Electoral headquarters do not spend such sums of money on polls and focus groups unless they consider something seriously,” Martin said in the AK 360 program.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about a possible altercation.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the president was “informed” of a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that Obama “maybe” knew.
Martin added that the “double stamps” did not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political scanning had reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama had not been aware of the study of the possibility of excluding Biden from the electoral roll.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
Would you like a glow in the dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first glowing ice cream in the dark with a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with this idea by reading the science article on jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically recreate a glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the language of the person who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the "Life me, I'm delicious," says, "This is an incredible thing, but it's still at the very initial stage, in terms of production, so you'll get about 2 g of the substance for £200."
The squirrel we're using in ice cream reacts to your language with a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the squirrel, it'll raise the pH level and the ice cream will start glowing.
We've been testing it over the last few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce it to Halloween, because it produces such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because fluorescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each balloon costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef, and taste of cosmic gold.
But its next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals, which make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Avangard coach Wladimir Chebaturkin, referring to the preparation of his team for the regular KHL match against Salawat, noted that Omichi had carried out a thorough analysis of the damage from the MG Metalurg.
The expert stressed that the Avantgarde needed to focus on the defense game.
We've been watching a video game against the Magnetgorical "Metalurg", which is the official website of the "Avangarde" of Chebaturkin's word.
- Missed a lot of pucks, not a very nice moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because of failure to perform a game.
We knew the opponent had performers.
Statistically, they had five hits on the move - three pucks hit us.
Very good implementation.
Have these errors been taken into account in preparing for the game today?
The guys and I are going to take each match carefully, talk after the game, get ready for a new rival.
The main thing is that the installation will be carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metalurg.
The game was performed, and the score was 2:0.
Missed the ball in the locker room, and in the third period, they started to make a mistake.
Given how hard the game was going, it didn't make any sense to get the defenses involved.
You have to back off with the whole team.
Now the Avantgard has a long home series, the games go in the next day - the team's got a lot of fatigue?
All commands are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is to do your moments and to do the game.
Hockey is an emotional game, and if you do the setup, it's not that hard to deal with.
Due to the new regulations introduced by Russian Customs, hundreds of furs have been in line for almost a week at the border with Russia.
Today, Donut officials have promised to provide the drivers with potable water and biota
At the border points, hundreds of furs had been dug up at the time of entry to Russia.
This situation was due to the change in the Customs procedures for the handling of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the turn is being made by the Russian side, which did not give any advance notice of any new developments.
As of 28 October, the Russian Customs authorities had introduced additional measures to guarantee the delivery of the goods, as reported by the Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs, Vladimir Denisov.
The new model is applied in countries that have acceded to the convention on international transport.
Passports are in high mode.
The correspondent of FACTOV visited the border and contacted the truckers who had been held hostage to the situation.
Prices in the road-café store at the “Novoazovsk” pass point are rising daily, as is the queue from the fur.
Trucks stand in a number of rows, stretching about two kilometers.
The Novoazovsk - Veselo-Vosenska Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine by international motorway.
The goods are therefore sent to the Stavropol province of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight, a trucker named Alexei Golovanev, who is transporting a cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan in transit and is sleeping in his car for almost a week, complains.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and a payment for the cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which they are taken.
Minimum insurance is between 4.5 and 5,000 roubles (about 1,100 and 1,300 hryvnias).
Those who drive nearby (say Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 roubles (3,800 hryvnias) and pass.
And the rest of us are stuck, 'cause no one has that big money with them!
Can you imagine, if a driver is transporting a shipment worth just four thousand dollars, but to Moscow, he needs 90,000 roubles (almost 23,000 hryvnias) to pay for the transit!
The preconditions for survival at the border, no, are grieving by the truckers who are set up to eat in front of their cars.
Border shops and cafés are always expensive, but we've never met a price like this!
The sellers set out and quickly rolled them up: 15 hrivens, seven hrivens, a cup of coffee, and 25 hrivens, a plate of soup.
It's the only one.
There's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the bathroom.
No washing, no shaving...
I can stay out of the car for a week, and my wife's ready for me on the road.
I'll take a week to comfort myself with another trucker, Victor Scotarenko.
But will my car get a line in a week?
Why do you have a liter and a half of water?
There's 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, is the bottle crystal or is the water insistent on silver?
We have a café, not a store.
Take it while there's something else, the salesgirl's on the table.
After media coverage began, the plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities in the region.
The leadership of the Ambrosia and Novoas Regional Offices was entrusted with the task of providing drinking water to all those in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border, as stated by the Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Oblast, Sergey Dergunov.
Ambulance teams are now on duty at the outposts.
Biota will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the queue problem will be resolved in the coming days.
As at 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles had been parked at the international “Uspenka” and “Novoazovsk” gates, according to the Donetsk press service.
The “FACTS” will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out informational provocations against high-ranking Lithuanians and Eastern Partnership countries, a statement made by BNS in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is about to “converse” the President of Lithuania, Dalj Gribauskait, and to publish the falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosarchy, which relate to the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the Department for the Analysis of the Public Processes of the Office of the President of Russia on Inter-regional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is responsible for the preparation of the information attack.
The structure is led by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania on numerous occasions and participated in the Congress of the Lithuanian People ' s Party.
A member of the Department of V. Smirnov is also allegedly involved in the operation.
According to the Special Service, Smyrnov, under cover of scientific work, visited Lithuania regularly until the end of 2012 and was in contact with local politicians, political scientists and the media.
Smyrnov is now barred from entering the country.
On the eve of the day, the President of Lithuania, Gribauskait, announced that he was aware of the computer that was preparing for it.
In her view, the main reason was the success of Lithuania's presidency of the Council of the European Union and the “country's desire for energy independence”
The Lithuanian leader had previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities on a number of occasions.
So she claimed that in the Kremlin, Lithuania was “not respectful enough”.
In addition, the Gribauskate accused the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, of proposing “only claims” to Lithuania.
Recall, in September Rossesznadzor suspended the import of the Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the product was not in line with sanitary and epidemiological standards.
At that time, the leader of Lithuania stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government of the country should prepare for the application to the WTO.
In the United States, the headmaster shot at teenagers.
The headmasters of one of the American high schools have literally made teenagers desperate.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, the young bullies left the man's home with toilet paper.
As a result, the headmaster opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the bullies were not in the property of the director, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released on bail at $125,000.
Let's say the shooting of civilians in the United States is becoming a horrendous pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened a fire in downtown Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California, right down the street.
The perpetrator then took two random passers-by hostages, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Previously, in New Town Primary School, Connecticut, there was a shooting.
Adam's mom worked at school, and she was an educator.
Shots fired at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place on 31 January at an American school, this time in Anlant, Georgia.
Two people suffered: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

2013 Halloween in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late to sleep, and make a dressing party for our neighborhood.
Now I'm more of a scumbag.
I haven't volunteered for the last two years to hand out candy in my apartment, and I'm probably not gonna do it this year.
But the statistics show that I'm a white crow in the area of Halloween.
According to the National Distributive Federation, most Americans, namely, 158 million, will be celebrating Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is a trend.
The National Distributive Federation forecasts $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent on suits.
This year at the top of the fashion, sexual inanimate objects.
Women are no longer required to be sex professionals; they can also be sex food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies thanks to "The Walking Dead," and I'm sure that the Dant Punk-style cosmonauts will get into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the suits that most of the search for are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
Perhaps there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Distributive Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet suits.
It means a lot of funny hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't waste time.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey's chocolates, candy candy, Milk Duds's candy, Twizzlers' gums, and Clark Bar's candy bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, that's great news for 41 million candy-demanded children who are ready to conquer our districts.
In fact, we're going to buy, and we're not going to lie to ourselves, we're going to eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is candy in the form of corn grains, and yet, according to the National Association of Caederians, almost 35 million pounds are sold for Halloween.
It's about nine billion individual corn grains.
This is a riddle that I still have to figure out.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween more than a home with ghosts.
They have amazing titles, such as "Awe behind the walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "War and Cry," and "The House of Shock."
Moreover, according to American Hunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America that generate about 500 million dollars of income, as well as the amazing pictures you almost put down, which your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't remove, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like "cool face expression."
And in conclusion, let's talk about the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting Jack's lamp is like decorating the Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Luckily for us, the fashion for the baby in the pumpkin started only last year thanks to the Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out those pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's lamp, slowly dried up on your porch, is probably coming from the state of Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want a harder task, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to cut out some of their 2032-pound pumpkin.
The Estonian Defense Department site was rebuilt after the attack by the Ukrainian hackers.
The site of the Estonian Ministry of Defence was re-established after the morning cyberattack, and is reported by the press service of the Department.
According to the Department of Defense's Vice-Chancellor for Information and Administration, Timmar Petercope, it was a primitive attack, the site was overloaded with a lot of requests.
Our experts have quickly set up the site, and so far the site has been rebuilt.
"The damage to the Ministry is minimal," said Petershop to the Posttimees.
According to Petercope, it's too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
“We will certainly analyse the causes of the incident and draw conclusions from it, but it is not possible to prevent such incidents,” he acknowledged.
On November 1, the Anonymous Akraine group posted a online message that confirmed the hacking of the Estonian Defence Department website and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO's servants.
The Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of the NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need the NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," says Anonymous.
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine had previously reported that a company of the Marines of the Teodosian individual battalion of the Ukrainian Marines would take part in the NATO reaction force command and control exercises, Steadfast Jazz-2013.
A number of schools and a hospital had to be closed because of the violence of unclean power.
Four schools in South Matabeleland, Zimbabwe, had to be closed because the students had been attacked by... goblins.
According to the local elder, the children were in a state of panic, and it was not possible to continue their studies.
The story of goblins may sound like a baby for a European, but in Africa this is a very serious argument for school shutting down.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, a hospital was closed in Zimbabwe because medical personnel had also been attacked by goblins.
The Land Rover race series was announced.
Inside are race seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an internal communication system.
In addition, modernised brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support, and car storage between events can be obtained.
Drew Bauler, manager of Bowler Motorsport, said, "The rally's participants at Bowler have changed."
Some of them are not experienced riders, but people looking for excitement, adventures, and access to world-class events.
We are happy to offer this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try the different disciplines of the rally in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare the participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally.
We've been very enjoying the Defender Challenge car, which is going to be a really exciting championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to take part in events in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian Soldiers are not aware of the Brotherhood Group - New News
INTERFAX.RU writes about this with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After media reports of the United States Department of Finance's placing Leps on the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Broth Circle", we went through all the databases, but no such group was found," said the agency's interlocutor.
In his view, the dissemination of that information helped to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which was allegedly operating abroad.
As previously written "NEX", yesterday the US Department of Finance posted on its website a list of alleged members of the "Brother Circle" criminal group.
Among them was the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
It's on the list as "Greesha," it was posted the previous day.
They match the data of a popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevride, the creative alias, the place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five others are mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli national, an Uzbek national, and another from the former USSR, whose nationality is unknown.
In the United States, Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, is confident that he was transporting money for the bandits on their orders.
This report contains a picture of the singer and all his relevant data.
In fact, Leps did buy a house on Phuket recently.
The agency indicated that it intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
Putting a person on blacklists in the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs entails blocking his assets in the United States and prohibiting business contacts with him by people living in the United States.
Leps' assistant Maya Serikov said that no notices had been given to the singer: "It's hard to answer the question whether it's the Gregory that everyone's talking about right now in connection with the US scandal."
All Leps knows is the media.
He had not been formally notified, although I do not know if they do exist in such cases.
"And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, surprisingly and unexpectedly," she said to RIA News.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live on Phuket, but, according to the U.S. Department, he does have a home on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps is currently on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him on a flight to the city of Blavetschensk.
Ran out on the field in the Shinnik match.
Some details of the identity of the fan who ran out to the field during the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup between the Jaroslav Shinnik and the Moscow Spartak.
According to the head of the RFC, Arthur Grigorianz, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Moscow.
He's in custody at the moment.
"In addition, Gregoriant spoke of how the fan managed to break through the field: "It turns out that this one, we call him a viewer, went to the ambulance, accompanied by two viewers, citing heart problems.
He went to the E.R. - that was confirmed by the E.R.
And then he pushed out the two chaperones and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South Tribune to the corner of the East and North Tribune.
He ran all over the field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Prior to the entry into force of the sport law, it's a steward's area of action - the police can't interfere with what's in the field.
He ran to the podium, climbed over the East Tribune.
And at that time there was a riot on the East Tribune and on the runways," the head of the KDC said.
Recall that the decision of the KDC of Moscow's "Spartak" will hold the upcoming events of the 15th round of Russia's "Locomotive" and "Zenita" and will pay a fine of 600,000 roubles.
The fire brigades were called to save the lost puppy, who was stuck 50 feet above the ground in a dangerous quarry.
Coker-spaniel Ruby ran off after she had a little accident.
Three days later, when she was stuck in a career, she was spotted by a man walking a dog.
The firemen came down on a rope on a hillside to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was lucky to escape after the fire brigades had been summoned to pick it up and deliver it to a safe place, after it had somehow been stuck at a height of 50 feet on a dangerous slope of the elevation.
A nine-month-old Coker-spaniel, Ruby, ran off after having had a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her hosts, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at the Fleppet's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They hunted their missing dog feverishly and posted messages on social media sites after she ran off to the quarry after a small accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a star dog driver spotted Ruby stuck at a height of 50 feet in his career.
A technical rescue team from the Clekhiton fire station rushed to the scene, went down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used a transporter to lift her up the hill.
Andy Clayton, a rescue officer, said, "She was in a dangerous situation."
It was right in the middle of a high slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move her muscle during the rescue, and she's completely frozen.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
The rescue officer Peter Lowe said, "Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued."
There was a chance that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, and it was found that she was all right, except for dehydration and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Keep watching the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when it was in our hands again.
The vet said that if she had lost power and lost consciousness, she'd probably have fallen.
The firemen were great.
It was very brave - what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson, from Kitley, added: "We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there."
The firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe it was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with the Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a back-up singer for the 2004 Jagger song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a rocker vet, and she said, "He was flirting with me when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of 70-year-old Jagger said that he “kategoryly denied that he had ever hit Cathy Perry.”
The representative added: “Perhaps she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who showed up as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking up with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free-moving zone as a condition for EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Adrian's shaft.
True, Strathclyde has pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement in the rest of Europe, although, predictably, it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that EU member countries spend a lot of time turning their formal rules in the way they like.
Since Scotland is no longer part of the Schengen Zone, continued non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what he really wanted from the Scots.
So it's a non-negotiable story.
And it's so old that it's become a fossil: for the first time I've heard a "duck" that "independence means passport control," at least 40 years ago.
Still, there's an interesting moment lost in telling an old story.
Why does an independent Scotland have to obey Europe's orders?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With Eurocrisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
All over the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or for the euro to be abolished as a single currency are gaining power.
Even in Germany, the party of Euroskeptics “Alternative for Germany” — founded only this year — came out of nowhere and won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus effectively displacing the “Free Democrats” (an analogy of our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There's always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency, led many to believe that the “Europe” project had gone too far.
The euro crisis is not much linked to the fact that national governments are working with excessive fiscal deficits — it was only for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members at the exchange rates that are advantageous to German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is at a predetermined disadvantage in terms of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut wages and public spending, which Berlin actively supports.
Behind the current problems of the budget and currency is the deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacity.
As a result of the Green Energy package introduced by Brussels, a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the US.
It's a paralysing poor price environment, as we've seen in Granjmouth.
No freeze in the world will stop the devastating victory of US cheap slate gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a revolt, particularly in France, once the most powerful supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and to place Paris at the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s devastated economy in distress.
The result is a right-wing anti-EU party, Marin Le Pen, the National Front, just won the decisive additional elections, hurling the ruling party of socialists to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24% of the votes, a timely warning to British laborers that it is not possible to assume that a split among the right will automatically affect the left.
What's Le Pen doing with his new-found popularity in the French white working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If – and this is very likely – the anti-EU parties are supported in this election, it will be possible for the first time to take a dominant position in the European Parliament.
Here's my point: the growing sentiments against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will come together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become a sort of vague “Europe (submissive) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and a few dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distanced from this project in the hope of getting closer to the US.
Still, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific shows that it is likely that Britain will be left unattended in the cold of the Atlantic.
In what position does that leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect Scotland will succeed in a more free European agreement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-Federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider replicating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is, oddly speaking, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which obtained an impressive majority of votes in 2011 because of the objections to cost cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Tory and Liberal Democrat Coalition.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence just to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging Before
African-American and Latin-American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers do research.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic can be a trigger mechanism for early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Eterage is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened if her daughter is beginning to form breasts and grow pubic hair at 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, a child endocrinologist, Dr. Paul Caplowitz, explained that these early physical changes are common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time soothing my parents — usually it doesn't mean a quick rise to full puberty,” Caplowitz said.
Evident signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair, and the smell of the body, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a small shift in menarche age (first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“As the breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before the menarche,” said Caplowitz, who is also the author of the book “The Rooting of Puberty in Girls: How to Cope with the Difficult Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a discussion of what is the actual occurrence of puberty, but is considered to be “premature” when the breast increase is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to eight years.
In most cases the process will slow down or slow down — it is that a paediatrician can monitor closely.
More rapid progress can be the basis for an endocrinologist's tests to avoid serious problems, such as tumors or cystics.
There are procedures to slow down early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can eventually lead to slower growth and low growth at an adult age.
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, level of development, rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is careful with the drugs, but admits that “addiction of puberty can alleviate the behavioural problems and feelings of girls that they are different from those of their peers.”
Another big problem is that parents just don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they deal with hygiene,” Caplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter began her menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-proclaimed theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, have early puberty.
Caplowitz claims that the assumption that has the greatest weight is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, it helped to conduct a study of 6-9-year-old girls, which linked the amount of fat in the body to the period of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latin-American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers.
There are different explanations.
Worldwide, early puberty is likely to be affected by all, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
A further riddle is that while boys have face and puberty hair at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is less pronounced than girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair even occurs in infants and children of crèche age.
“We have to be careful how we determine the true occurrence of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at the Gorieb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be shy about getting instructions from a paediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean an earlier than expected conversation,” Caplowitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when they do so before they do, this process is a normal part of life.
The United States Boeing is stuck in Cheeta.
The observer flight of the Treaty on Open Sky over the territory of Russia, which made an unplanned landing on Wednesday in Chite, on Friday, 1 November, at 8.30 p.m. Moscow time, will leave the city's air harbor.
The airport's management allowed the flight to take off after getting the money for the fuel.
According to the airport, the plane will fly to Ulaan-Ude.
According to other data, he's going to the United States.
It was reported that the flight in Ulaan-Uda landed in Zabaikal province due to the fog.
Due to unpaid invoices, he was not released from Cheeta Airport.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew, who spent two nights on the airport, reporting ITAR-TASS.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, persons on board an aircraft are not entitled to go outside the Chita airport, but can pass border control at only two Russian airports, in Cuba and in Ulaan-Ude.
The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992 and 34 States are parties to it.
Observer flights take place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, to promote the monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, to improve the capacity to prevent crises and to deal with crisis situations within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the dead celebrities make - MK in the U.S. MK
In 2013, the highest-income living celebrities ranked Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was "overtaken" by the late Michael Jackson, whose post-death income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
The other celebrities who left last year's "earnings" are lagging behind.
The second in the list of the most "richest" lost celebrities, compiled by the Forbes magazine, was Elvis Presley, 55 million a year, and the line below the "Peanuts" comic book author Charles Schultz, with 37 million.
In addition to this, Elizabeth Taylor, a former leader (25 million) last year, and musician Bob Marley (18 million) were included in the first five.
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein.
The first boutique of Igor Guliev opened in Moscow
On October 23, the opening of Igor Guliev's first flagman boutique was held in Moscow.
Designer Igor Guilleume is known to the general public for his magnificent lux furs.
And now more fashion fans can appreciate them - his first boutique was finally opened in Moscow, and the designer threw a dolce vita party.
I'm sure there are the most beautiful girls in Russia.
So I'm particularly glad to have a store open in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's a part of me.
That's the way Igor cut the red ribbon and invited everyone... to try on the look-alike models!
Jet manufacturers are at odds with the width of the seat when big orders are at stake.
There was a heated debate among the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the traveling class seats on long voyages, setting the tone for the brutal confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seats provided on long-range flights to the economy-class passengers, whose interests are not always at the centre of the airlines, while the space allocated to them plays a key role in the allegations of the efficiency of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of a industry standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the salons of the economy class, but its main American rival, Boeing, said that it was up to the airlines.
The argument is at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of increasingly large versions of their two-motor long-range jets, and the event from 17 to 21 November is expected to produce potentially record orders.
The layout of the back of the plane, especially whether 9 or 10 people sit in row, is central to the statements of the cost-effectiveness of new mini-airbus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economic class more than 17 inches in width, set at 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of her A350 will transport 350 people in an economy class in 18-inch-width seats, 9 in a row.
Airfaring giants often exchange technical blows through adverts in the professional press.
And now Airbus is directing the public to the air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to become a leader with over 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the beginning of a new advertising war might be by showing the financiers a slide of three people in a restaurant clinging to each other, entitled “Would you accept it?”
“Boeing offers long-range seat flights more narrowly than regional turbo-wing aircraft,” said Airbus sales manager John Lichi.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but the plane seats have not changed radically.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the 747 high-powered Boeing set standards for modern long-distance travel, and the limit of the century, the weight of the average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The 21st-century average man's waist is 39.7 inches, according to the U.S. Health Service.
Airbus claims that her competitor follows the 1950s seat concept, when the average grip of those recently called “reactive public” was already in place.
Airbus says she ordered a study that shows that an extra inch in the seat's width improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing contests the Airbus figures by seat size and says that manufacturers should not interfere with decisions on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and comforts.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the cabin is not limited to the width of the seat.
“The real thing is to give airlines a choice and an opportunity to do what they think they need to do to make a success,” said Boeing in Kent Craver's salon.
They do not want us to judge for them that which will bring them profit.
They know better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the side, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect the profit.
Behind this argument is a race to order planes, estimated at at least $700 billion at a core price in the coming decades, that is enough to change the ratio of American to European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seating is exactly what warms up rivalry in the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability in their last two-motor long-range models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared Boeing characteristics are based in part on a comparison of the 10-seated 777X series with the original 9-seat set of the 777 design series.
The profit in unit cost is reduced when compared to the 10-place layout currently in use.
“The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more space and make his plane more competitive than we do,” said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with full 10-seat rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“The seat of 18 inches wide would be perfect for the passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the offer of Airbus is due to a threat from the 777th model,” said Mary Kirby, an interior specialist, the founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver chairs, but offer a directory of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world’s jet salesmen even carry roulettes to test rival designs.
In order to be comforting, all manufacturers also offer very tight-walled planes for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications to the cabins, offering wider passage spaces on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “fly,” but it can divert attention from the wave of sales of the 777X model.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine can rob the smoking process of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could rob the smoking of fun cigarettes.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from life-long nicotine addiction.
Further tests are needed before human tests start, which will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Whale Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralize them before they reach the brain, prevent the smoker from getting a nicotine strike.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were later given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice that didn't get the vaccine "relaxed," and that's a sign that nicotine was reaching their brain, the researchers say,
These experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, the shots had to be made so often that they proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to the children before they want to try a cigarette to prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers to stop smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of it,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Oleynikov: one third of the rural settlements of Podskova
The vice-governor of the sub-Moscow region, Yuri Oleinikov, stated that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are entirely grantable
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 receive grants from the region ' s budget.
In 2013, 187 out of 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
Subsidies account for more than 50 per cent of the budget of 122 rural settlements and 83 per cent of the budget.
As part of the budget, about 25 billion roubles are allocated from the regional budget," said Oleynikov.
The vice-governor also pointed out that only three urban settlements - Somitish, Lone and Pushkino - had a budget of more than 1 billion roubles in 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million roubles, “it is not enough.”
The cost of maintaining a local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in Podskova is over 70 per cent, with “deficient quality of services”, noted Oleynikov.
He had previously instructed the heads of the municipalities of Pod-Moscow to consider, before the end of November, which settlements needed to be consolidated, integrated into urban districts or changed in the system of administration.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to that, the Governor of the Moscow Region had stated that, as part of the administrative reform, there were plans to reduce the number of rural grant settlements in Podskovje.
There is also a request for the consolidation of municipalities in the Mojaysk, Kashir, Solar, Kolomen, Lubertsach and Kotelniks.
This issue will be discussed in the cities and regions of the region in November.
The President of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Igor Brunzalov, also stated that all of it was planned to be combined in the next 30 rural settlements in the 12 districts of Podskova.
This is due to the fact that less than a third of the 178 rural settlements in Podskovje have a “acceptable” financial base, while 100 have a grant base.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenin doesn't hide the great joy she's getting from raising her children.
Although Arbenin is now particularly time-consuming in creativity and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to deal with Martha and Artem, not only wasted time on their studies, but also entertains as much as she can.
In the last week, Diana twice reported to her fans on her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted a picture on Facebook that shows how she teaches her children to read.
And yesterday, I spoiled the fans by showing me how Artem and Martha dressed up for Halloween.
We're ready for the broom race! our first Halloweyen" - that's what Diana called a picture of her children dressed in holiday suits.
Which is incomprehensible, because they, like any other Russian boy or girl, have something to do with this festival because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce an “undefined sex” when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow the registration of children born of hermaphrodites to indicate “undefined” instead of “male”.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the "sex" on the birth certificate unfilled for a while.
For "F" (female) or "M" (male) parents can write "X" (unspecified) for a while.
The aim of this decision is to prevent parents from rushing into a sex “clarification” operation.
According to the statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born of hermaphrodite.
Tripodie denies being influenced by Obaid
Former New South Wales Minister of Labour, Joe Tripodi, will be a member of the State's anti-corruption oversight body.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denies the change in the lease of offshore facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obaid, who had secretly held shares in three properties on public land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation of whether Mr. Obeid had lobbyed several state ministers for the extension of leases to Cercular Kee, where the Obaid family owns two restaurants and cafés, without tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid ' s secret involvement in real property, following the testimony given by the former Deputy Chief of Administration, Mr. Tripodi Lynn Ashpool, on Thursday.
In the course of several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease should be open to the public.
The tenants were against it and also wanted a longer lease.
In 2009, business leases at Cercular Kee, which contributed about $2.5 million a year to the Obeid family, were extended without a public tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, according to Mr. Tripodi, had urged changes in the Government ' s rent policy.
In the ICAC decryption of the telephone conversations, in August and September 2007 talks were made between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunne, a senior official, who had come to the Ministry of Ports after working under the direction of Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
“Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations the development of a commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," he replied. "
I can't remember what was being discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria
A high-level administration official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli warplanes had struck targets in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night.
The official didn't say what the target was, but he said at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out air strikes on cargo with rockets inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers in sub-class 457 can be tested for “trueness”
The “trueness” test for foreign workers on class 457 visas is under consideration by the Government, as it envisages an expansion of repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied to criteria aimed at preventing the use of 457-class visas to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole for the movement of families and friends to Australia.
The paper presented by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McQueen criticized the Government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying that it might offend Australia's neighbours.
“Big statements like `foreigners at the end of the queue' and `early Australians' are a very unpleasant setback to a time when trade unions were demanding a secure labour market,' she said to the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that needed to be protected, and if some in the region had seen the excerpts of this historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The paper for discussion sets out the 12 measures that had previously been considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he was meeting with officials for the smuggling of persons, had already made five of the recommended changes, while the rest were under consideration.
If the criteria of “trueness” are accepted, the applicant may be examined for a visa “to the extent that the applicant is a relative or a close familiar owner or a person involved in the financing of the business”.
Enterprises may also be required to account for the number of visa holders in sub-class 457, since previously enterprises that had intended to sponsor a small number of employees had taken over hundreds of employees.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker had reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man ' s nine-year-old father, who had lost his grief, accompanied him on his way to Australia, and had been supported by a cousin since his father ' s death on Wednesday, who had also been on board.
The Australian authorities rushed a man to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A friend of Semen Varlamov claimed that the hockey player had alcoholism
A friend of the hockey player, Semen Varlamov, Yevgeny Vavrinyuk, said that he suffered from alcoholism, was handing over to the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said the woman in particular.
Recall that Vavrinyuk sued for the beating of the Russian Hollywood team, Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player pulled her hair off and beat her hands, breasts, abdomen and neck after the attack.
Varlamov himself went to the Denver Police and confessed to the beating, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at $5,000.
The court did not restrict the travel of the athlete to the country, but it did not allow him to approach Vavrinyuk.
He also faces a prison sentence of up to six years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact on Scotland of the HS2 project.
Project HS2 involves the opening of a high-speed message to Scotland and North England, with the start of Phase 1 in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project “will unite the United Kingdom”.
The Scottish Minister of Transport, Keith Brown, said that he was “excited” by the prospect of working on the plan with the British government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed line between London and West Midlands.
When Stage II is complete, the lines will be set up in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of constructing a high-speed line between London and North England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is negotiating with the Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the rail bandwidth and the shortening of travel time for North England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal for HS2 is to create a real national network that will bring Britain and its cities closer to each other."
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are huge.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the transport of cities to each other; throughout the United Kingdom, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best message from HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's ad is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “mutually” support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the common reasoning for the high-speed rail all over the United Kingdom.”
We are therefore happy to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, for the benefit of all, and for the continuation of the Glasgow-Edinburgh rail line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Thorium is a new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide for energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative effect on the climate.
Renewed sources of energy require large areas for generation.
Atomic power costs both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste management.
Recently, scientists drew attention to thorium, another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and experts claim that its splintering does not leave waste that must be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia for the time being will be in force
Australian airline passengers will need to continue switching off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite United States measures to relax the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Air Administration has allowed US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided that they stay in Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do so during the main part of the flight, but it is irritating to many that they do not have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which requires American airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases still existed in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Department does not currently have special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” he stated.
This issue is governed by regulations that require air carriers to maintain security at any time and that passengers to observe the safety regulations that are reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, did not object to the changes, but stated that it would follow the regulator's instructions.
“We would welcome a review by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of the issue of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we do think that this will improve the quality of client services now that it (the wireless entertainment system) is on our planes,” said the Spokesperson.
Qantas stated that it would adhere to the rules currently in force.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change them anytime soon,” she said.
The FAA regulation applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in the regulatory changes that could benefit the passengers, and we will certainly look carefully at the decision of the FAW and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the effect of the order will vary from the airline to the airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
The carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to mobile radio alarms, as well as to review manuals, training materials, hand-held transport standards and passenger instructions.
“After the airline has verified and confirmed the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use hand-held, light electronic devices, such as tablets, e-books, and smartphones, at any height,” FAW stated.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group ' s recommendation, the heavier devices shall be located under the seats or in the upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan is heard in the anthem of Kubani's notebooks of extremism
The football match between "Ange" and "Cubanya" resulted in a political conflict between the Krasnodar province and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Cubani anthem sounded in a different way.
The head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday, invited the Republican Parliamentarians to go to court because the Anthem of the Krasnodar region allegedly calls for inter-ethnic discord, in particular, calls for a war against the Basurmans.
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar region, which is now approved in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one's doing it.
"Those who remember you here as their mother, as their enemy, to the basurman we go to the mortal fight" - to record such words in the hymn, to persecute some of the believers to the other believers, "expressed solidarity with the Abdulapit Chairman of Parliament, Hisri Shikhsaid.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, the news from the ocean, that is, Syria, where, as we have learned today, Israel has struck Russian-made missiles, which are said to have been targeted by Hizbollah.
Today, Syria has met an important condition: to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement brokered by Russia, which enabled the US not to carry out a military operation that it was close to this summer.
More about the weapons and what this means to the Syrian President, our main international correspondent, Richard Engel, will tell us.
Washington stated that the Assad regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died of poison gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombardments, but in the form of a deal that Assad's friend, Vladimir Putin, had made.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had decommissioned the declared chemical weapons factory.
The longer-term and heavy task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days are numbered.
I think Assad should go.
It's not about whether it's gonna happen, it's about when it's gonna happen.
He's no longer a legitimist, and he has to go.
But Assad stays.
And it feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are disunified and ill-armed.
His people had to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has escaped the penalty for mass murder.
The chemical weapons agreement is described as a success in diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has made an impression of a person willing to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, the US Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, it is not easy for his mother not to be killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's holding up for now.
And he's changing his weapon to power.
The President of the Russian Federation set up a separate Ministry of Construction and the GKH
Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, set up a new Ministry for Construction and GKH and offered to lead it to the former governor of Ivanov's region, Mikhail Menu, during his personal meeting.
The president met Michael Menem at the residence in Novo Ogarevo, and I did not refuse to head the new office.
The Spokesman for the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, explained that all the functions related to construction and the GKK are moving to a new ministry from the region.
Mikhail Meng is the son of a prominent Orthodox minister of protoirie Alexander Me, and he graduated from the Moscow Institute of Oil Chemistry of the name of Gubkin.
His political career began in 1995 - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergievo-Posad region, a member of the State Duma, the first Vice-Prime Minister of the Moscow Region, and a vice-premier of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Meng was the governor of Ivanov oblast.
Pawnlords in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is having difficulty
In a pawn shop at the Bendemir mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga puts a golden bracelet, ring, and earrings to pay for his daughter's school attendance.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is put in there,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt is on the rise, is such that ValueMax, where it deals, became the third pawn shop in Singapore this week.
Loan on jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthaling), but is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawn shops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered at the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a branch at the same mall.
However, pawn shops have the advantage of not requiring a credit test or proof of pay, and can lend faster than banks.
Millions of people in the region are therefore entering pawn shops, as families are under pressure from the cost of living and the rapid growth of household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and low-cost credit, fuelled by free monetary policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families resort to pawnshops to offset the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, identified an increase in the family's credit shoulder, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk to the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
The economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“The point is that with the rise in prices, people in the middle and bottom [the scale of income] will look for ways to increase their income wherever they can,” says Song Seng Woon, economist CIMB, Malaysian Bank.
Recordedly high gold prices in the past two years have increased the rush with which people place their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the stuff that is being put up in 200 pawnshops in the city-state are gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's put a gold chain on Grandma and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an increase in the number of clients using his offices in recent months, up to 20 percent.
The growth in the pawn business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the office in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, the executive director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion, using 60 per cent of the S$66 million this week as a result of shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders had been critiqued by high interest rates, she said that the pawnboard not only offered cheaper tariffs than other lenders, it also did not increase the debt directly.
“Clients plant items they already own, and the monetization of private assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The bill of lading is gaining increased public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured financing.
And the pawnshops are not limited to those who are in a difficult financial situation.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices to put in gold bars or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy persons who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small business enterprises that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” she said.
Sometimes they just need money very fast.
Today, it is not the number and status of health-care facilities that are available to the population, but the quality of care provided.
The programme “Modernization of the health care of Tull oblast 2011-2013” and the restructuring of our city's health-care institutions will make it possible to set up an optimal health-care structure for the population, including gynaecologically ill, pregnant and pregnant.
For example, following the merger with the hospital, it was even more possible to attract a narrow specialist from the GUZ “NICB” to consult pregnant women with a variety of pathologies, and to conduct additional hospital-based examinations.
During the modernization programme, the material and technical base of the maternity home was significantly improved, and modern equipment in line with global standards was introduced.
Over the years, some 8 million roubles had been allocated for the major maintenance of premises, and 112 items of equipment valued at 42 million roubles had been purchased.
The most up-to-date equipment is an intensive post for newborns.
In the O.R., the Cesarean section uses the Sell-Saver machine, which collects blood from the O.R. and, after special treatment, delivers it to the baby, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment has also been provided with a clinic-labular diagnostic unit.
An e-registration service is in operation at the women ' s clinic, and the introduction of electronic maps and patient history is planned in the near future.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it was possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, mothers and newborns with regional experts.
Chechens beat up and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens are arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been under way since March this year.
Some 60 women complained of the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes to a hotel in Strasburg and then beat and robbed them.
The gang's leader was a 27-year-old pre-trial citizen of Chechnya.
David Alab's defender of "Bavaria" became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reporting the official Bondsley website.
In this dispute, he outpaced the winter sports that have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second was a skier, Marcel Hirsher, and the third was a ski jumper from the spring of Gregor Schlirentsauer.
Last season, an Austrian 21-year-old Filipino-Nigerian helped his team win the League of Champions, the German Cup and the Super Bowl of UEFA.
Arshavin's ex-wife rests with actor Andrej Chadov.
The former civil wife of the Peter's "Zenita" footballer, Andrei Arshavina Yulia Baranovskaya, is on vacation with actor Andrey Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy with an actress, Anastasia, and her fiance, Sergei Slavnov, and an actor, Andrei Chadov.
Photos from the joint couple walks are published in Instagram Anastasia.
This is not the first joint picture of Andrei and Julia.
On October 5, the road published a picture of the couple holding a hug on the coast of the Gulf of Finland in Komarov.
In mid-October, "Zenita", Andrei Arshavin confessed to living apart from his civilian wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovskaya and Andrej Arshavin have been together since 2003, having three children.
It has recently become known that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Arshavin's new friend was married to the corporate top manager.
A $325 million rescue package for health care in Tasmania
The federal government insists that a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's weakened health system will be complemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the state government will not waste money.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plybersek, announced that the Commonwealth was taking “emergency measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island's population, the higher levels of chronic diseases and the system's limitations.
A four-year funding decision was taken after consultation by the Government with the independent Tasmanian deputy, Andrew Wilke.
“The Government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific problems facing the state,” said Ms. Plybersek today.
A $325 million package includes $31 million for a Blitz campaign on planned operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help to bridge the backlog.
There is also money for unregistered clinics in Hobart and Lonceston to improve the quality of post-patient care, to train health professionals, mental health services and to introduce personal electronic health-care card systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will be based on the ideas put forward by advanced doctors on how best to help the Tasmanian health system,” said Ms. Plybersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in strict accountability and responsibility.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and to report monthly on where it spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would not solve anything “unless a real reform that would put Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable basis will follow”.
However, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to bringing the state's health system out of critical condition,” said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional sample procedures are largely compensating for recent cuts.
But the federal opposition health representative Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is a “leave-like solution”.
“The reason we're here is that the state labor government puked $430 million out of the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
When the state's government rips off nearly half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth invests 300 million dollars, you can't pretend to be good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plybersek to guarantee that no dollar in the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Niklu's novel, Denis Diderot, can boast of an exceptional performance and historical details, but it is also more difficult to understand than it should have.
The film, which is taking place in France in the 1760s, tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat, who was sent to the monastery by her family.
When it starts to rebel, it suffers extreme cruelty at the hands of the Sadist Chiefess and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never drops to obscene or sensationality, and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the story risked becoming a test, like a pencil, for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons, says the observer group
Syria destroyed basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, declared on Thursday by an international observer group, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, close to one of the sites believed to contain toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group claimed that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day prior to the
The deadline of 1 November, established by this organization based in The Hague, for Damascus to destroy or “incapacitate” all means of chemical weapons production and mechanisms to mix chemical substances with the production of poison gas and to fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
This statement was made during the intense fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, where experts believe the chemical weapons production site and the storage site are located, reports the British-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights.
A group of activists who tracked the losses through a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of that number, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government side, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-Government militants and 187 were Lebanese militants of Hizbollah.
Also among the dead, according to the statement, were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to a United Nations estimate of 25 July, 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought with rebels in Safir for weeks, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there had been casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The battles highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors in the midst of the ongoing civil war in the short time frame of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied with the fact that it had verified and seen the destruction of all critical production and mixing/fuelling equipment declared by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the two sites for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that both sites had, according to Syria, been “displaced and ... items of the chemical weapons programme in them had been relocated to other declared sites that had been verified”.
It was not possible to find out immediately whether the site in Safir was one of the two sites that the OPCW inspectors had been unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in the most complex mission that this organization has ever undertaken,” said the Director-General of the observer group Ahmet Üzümcü in a comment published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has confronted the rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad Government and its security forces, which are members of its Alavit sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of the Rami Abdurrahman centre said that there had been a severe explosion on Wednesday at an air defence site in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Worried by the conviction of the planners of the Bali terrorist attack
The 202 survivors and relatives of the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted in anger to the sentence of the last of the conspirators, who had been brought to trial, and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run, as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in building the explosive devices used in the attack.
He may be released within 15 years if he is on parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and dozens more injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches all over Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person who was called a bomber for his reputation as a bomb master must be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memory of the mother of Perth June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack by Patek and his associates almost ten years ago.
With her tears almost in check, she said that Patek was to be sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
He's got to stand in front of the shooting team,' said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The "Sari" club was destroyed when a massive explosive device, parked outside the van, was detonated immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack full of explosives 20 seconds earlier.
After that attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "dead" three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre — Amrosi, Mukhlas and Imam Sawishad, who had been executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
Keeping him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds, that's not much.
Patek is the last party to the Bali attack to be brought to trial.
He had been in hiding for almost ten years, but he was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where American troops killed the former Al-Qaida leader, Usama bin Laden, less than four months later.
In the course of the trial, the FBI agent testified that the intelligence data showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between the terrorist groups of South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he had not been sorry for the grief he had caused to others.
The sentence is in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“This year there will be a lot of tears,” says Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: "Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but not call from a mobile phone)"
Airfarers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch films, and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, in line with the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Air Administration.
But the passengers must not expect the changes to take place immediately.
How quickly this change is being implemented will vary according to the airline, said the FAA administrator Michael Worth at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show FAW how their planes meet the new guidelines, and that they update their training manuals for air crew members and the installation regulations to meet the new guidelines.
Fau stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of hand-held electronics in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” said the FAH.
At present, passengers are required to shut off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane's door closes.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain says "good."
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is down for landing, and do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use the devices during take-off, landing and steering, FAW stated.
Most of the new aircraft and other fixed-wing aircraft, modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, the president of the professional flight attendants' association, welcomed the changes.
“When the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to do so), it will be a win-win option,” Glading said.
We are sorely tired of feeling “teacher-in-school” when it comes to this.
But Internet connection for surfing, sharing e-mails, text messages, or downloading data will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to the aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no "words with friends" - an intelligent Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the incident insinuated that the actor was taken off the American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was on its way to landing.
And the heavier devices, such as laptops, will still have to be put in the luggage compartment, because they can hurt someone if they fly all over the cabin.
Cell phone calls in flight will also continue to be banned.
The Federal Communications Commission, not the FAW, has the regulatory power to make calls.
FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Security Council, a national transport safety expert, CBS News, said that cellular phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigational devices, but we know, thanks to the FCC, that they can interfere with cellular towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to study the issue recommended last month that the Government permit the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the FAA has been under pressure to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics, such as Missouri's Senator-Democracy, Claire McKaskill, claim that there are no valid security reasons for bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAH began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to information on interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAW as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
The aircraft modified for the Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of pilots are designed to make more use of electronic devices in line with the new guidelines, said Weert.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio signals that are much lower in power than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, send only minimal messages when scrolling a page.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices download or send data.
Among those who sought to reduce the restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company downloaded a whole aircraft with its electronic book readers, and flew it to check the problem, but never found it.
The members of the Fau Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Association of Airporters, stated that he considered interference with the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only a few pilot reports confirming that the devices might interfere with air systems, most of which were very old.
The committee recommended, however, that the FAA permit pilots to require passengers to deactivate the devices during landings in reduced visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step to meet the passengers, who are now using a lot of technology.
“We are glad that the FAW recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Doe, Director General of the US Tourist Association.
Schools will be able to perform driver's exams
A driver's license examination will be available to private companies that have their own computer-assisted motorway.
This is written by “Commersant” with reference to the draft Government Regulation “On Admission to drive”.
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such motorways in Russia.
It is expected that students of such “privileged” motor schools will be counted on the results of internal testing.
In so doing, the State Inspectorate will monitor the completion of the examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 per cent of the theories and more than 20 per cent of the field do not pass the first time, the school will be denied privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for motorways contained in the draft Government Regulation are in force on 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training in the driving of two-wheeled machines.
As of 1 January 2015, motorcyclists will be required to take the urban driving test to obtain category A licenses.
In addition, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to employ drivers of foreign nationals with foreign rights.
Such workers would have to obtain Russian rights after the examination.
A bird transported by air to a safe place from a drilling plant in the North Sea, released back to the wild
A bird that had been airborne to shore after it had been found at an oil tower in the North Sea had been released back to the wild.
This water pasta was placed on a helicopter heading for Aberdeen last month, and was later released by the Scottish Animal Abuse Prevention Society (SPCA) in the rescue centre in Alla.
The manager of the center, Colleen Seddon, said: "This water pastor is most likely a winter migrant from North Europe who has entered the zone of strong winds over the North Sea."
It looks like the bird was exhausted and was able to find refuge at the oil tower.
He added, "She was unable to fly again, so we were asked for help."
The water caretaker was in good health by the time he was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and to determine what changes the UK's creators of wealth and jobs want to see in their relations with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on Britain, business, and the EU.
YouTube interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing a wide range of business in the UK in size, sectors and regions.
The findings of the poll will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently seeking export opportunities outside Europe, with special attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India, and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the complex EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from competition to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in the European trade zone, with even 40 per cent of the large enterprises traditionally the most pro-European of all companies agreeing to do so.
Last and foremost, our survey of business leaders has revealed that the obvious majority wants the British to be on a course to change the contract and to be on a trade-based rather than a policy-based relationship with the EU.
This result, which has been observed among all sizes and major business groups, shows that business is insisting on a “imaginable change” that will return to Britain.
The stakes are high: achieving contract changes and more favourable conditions for the UK will result in a 16 per cent shift in voting to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that the British business supports his plan to renegotiate British EU membership.
It also shows that business expects the revision to result in a significant shift in the current balance of power back to the UK.
The best environment for British business is possible and is becoming more necessary as the eurozone embarks on the path of closer economic and financial unification.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the United Kingdom, and, as the results of our survey show, for business this means a greater focus on trade and fundamental changes in the normative work of Brussels.
U.S. Special Services are tapping the pope's private phone.
The Vatican is under the watchful control of the United States security services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that US intelligence was auditioning all the talks of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now in close custody of Pope Francis.
His phone began to be tapped before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was also monitored.
What was of special importance in the US.
The Secret Service has reached out to the Cardinal's cell phones, who have gathered in Rome to select another Pope.
The phones of the place where the Conclaves lived were also heard.
American spies have tapped all the main candidates for the pope's throne to prevent the appearance of an unwelcome figure on it for Washington.
The magazine "Panorama" states that the "large ear of the United States" continued to intercept the conversations of the prelates until the end of the conclave on March 12.
In the United States, it is alleged that Archbishop Bergolio of Argentina has been named as the future Pope of Rome since 2005.
American intelligence was also engaged in negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
An Italian magazine reports that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continue to work at the US Embassy of Rome, extracting information on political and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, reconciledly declared that it did not care about the American wire, even if it was happening.
Holy fathers have no secrets from the U.S. leadership.
A snowboarder for the Olympic bills was specially photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a memorable note on the city of Sochi, where the Olympics will take place this winter.
The number of bills is 100 roubles.
But on the web, bloggers are already actively ironic about the memorable banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on 30 October, they noticed that the image of the snowboarder from the note was found in the photo banks.
In particular, in the free vault, a photo of StockExchange, which dates back to 2005.
The same picture is used in the Photoshop class, published on the Russian website "Megascope" on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it was used in the RugGear smartphone ad.
The Olympic note is made in blue and blue.
On the one hand, there is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other hand, a kind of Olympic stadium and a hot bird.
The designer of the note is Pavel Bushuev, who won a competition among the students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Painting.
At the presentation, it was noted that a number of sports - skiing, freestyle, and ski jumping - were under consideration, but they eventually chose snowboard, as it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source of the "Ivest", close to the BC, the regulator is not indifferent to the public view of the wide distribution of the image of a snowboarder from the Olympic banknotes and is currently studying the situation.
In the State party, however, there is not much concern about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of the State party, Natalia Nikiforov, said to the “News” that all the reasoning about plagiarism was funny.
The snowboarder on the note is turned to the right, in the photos on the web, to the left, clarified Nikiforov.
The person in the photo shoot to create the bill was taken from different angles, then the final picture was selected, and it was a characteristic posture of a snowboarder.
It also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist had been paid for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is very positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill - plus for promotion - is considered by the executive director of the PNP, Rus Brand, Alexei Popovichev.
It is difficult to prove the 100 percent resemblance of the images on the bill and in the photo banks, so it is unlikely that the intellectual property claim will be made.
For the first time, an Olympic note appeared in China - a memorable ten-yuan note was released by the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legal bans made Russians drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to them, the consumption of beer in the country next year will stay the same, and that's best.
Though the businessmen originally expected to grow.
This year is not good for them: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
The head of one of the country's largest brewery companies, Isaac Shepps, the President of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers at the Third Annual Conference of the Adam Smith Institute, “Commodities of Daily Demand in Russia”, which had just ended in Moscow.
It discussed public market regulation.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market had already declined by 18 per cent, as in recent years there had been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewery in the production and trade of beer, a small-alcohol drink, and Shepps had informed the listeners.
No country in the world has such a strict limit on the beer market, the unforeseeable imposition of new and new illogical bans, which are based on the alleged control of alcohol.
The beer was told that many of the legal prohibitions to reduce alcohol abuse had little impact, but new initiatives were constantly under way.
Beer manufacturers have been the worst hit by the ban on the sale of alcohol in kiosks since this year.
"We lost 35,000 consumers instantly," said Isaac Shepps.
Next year the brewers have two prognoses.
Optimist is the one Shepps was talking about: the sales of the foam drink will stay at the same level.
A pessimist will fall by another 2-3 percent.
In order to save their profits, businessmen have to move from mass-consumer varieties to the "premium" class: beer will be smaller, but it will be more expensive.
In the meantime, the radical effects of the fall in sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"I've observed that the level of alcoholism is about the same," said a drug doctor, Alexei Cellikov.
True, the proportion of sick people who use surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who are “submitted” to alcohol-consumptive drinks like the Jaguar, has increased, whereas 10 years ago, alcoholism was the “drinking” predominate.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford Auto Plant in Vlavodsk.
As the trade unions say, all those who have been dismissed have been compensated.
However, the issue of the reduction of productivity in the region is more acute than the problem of workers.
A deputy of the Regional Zachs Alexei Etmanov stated at the meeting that about 600 people had been cut off at the Ford factory in Zzvovodsk.
He said that this had happened in September, when some 600 people had left the factory under the voluntary dismissal programme, which had been developed with the organization's union.
The workers who had decided to resign voluntarily had been offered “golden parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority left their jobs of their own free will.
But, according to Etmanov, that number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's what this is about.
However, in the next two years, the authorities did not plan to adopt any support programmes for regional enterprises in difficulty,” he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the significant job loss.
In Ford, this information is not disproved or confirmed.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as he shows up, we're gonna publish it.
Talks about the contraction of workers at the Ford factory in Vladvodsk are going on a long time ago.
For example, the company's plans to fire 600 people had come to light in September.
The plant had previously stated that the production of motor vehicles had been suspended.
The reason in the factory was the drop in the demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, industrial production in Lenoblast fell by 5.4 per cent after nine months in 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobiles can be used during the take-off and landing of the aircraft
The new rules for the safe use of mobile devices during the take-off and landing of the aircraft have been approved in the United States, and BBC Telecorp reports.
US airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and the new regulations will be in place by the end of 2013.
However, Internet access to e-mail will be banned during flights below 3 kilometres.
As a result of the risk of interference with the aircraft ' s radio equipment, cellular voice will continue to be restricted.
Flight passengers will thus be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of the use of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the perceived impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft control.
According to the source, the U.S. example, it is also possible to re-evaluate the current standards for the use of electronic devices in flights in Britain.
The "Russian Mafia" in the U.S. has finally established a new name, "The Brotherhood Circle."
This week, the blacklist of the "Russian Mafia" in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Department of Finance has introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli into the Brotherhood.
One of the Russians turned out to be a prominent singer, Gregory Leps, who is suspected of transporting money to members of the group.
A total of 22 members of the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations are on the blacklist of the United States.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization actually exists.
"The declaration of the Brotherhood is more like an attempt to unite disparate criminal gangs," said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime, and professor at the University of New York.
In his view, the Brotherhood reflects the popular perception of the Russian Mafia.
“I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” quotes Mr. Galeotti, the American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organised Crime.
Professor Liz Shelley, George Mason University, also agrees with Mr. Galeoti.
“If they work together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” she cites the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organised Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Bruder's Circle” was more united by a closer Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as the Dead Hasan.
The criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, the activities of Lashi Shoshanashvili and Zachariah Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Grandpa Hasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Grandpa Hasan's nephew.
He noted, however, that some individuals did not belong to Usoian.
In his view, they all had common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
In the meantime, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Gregory Leps in the Brotherhood, the beloved singer of Russian president Vladimir Putin, has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partners, which led to a decision on why it was placed on such lists, said the Spokesman of the Head of State, Dmitry Peskov.
In any event, he (Leps) is a national of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
The head of Gazprom Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The launch of the South Flow gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
“Today, a landmark event took place: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Flow Gas Pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began,” said Chairman Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
The “south stream” is designed to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The contract dispute between Gazprom and his partners in Ukraine, which contains most of Russia's gas for Europe, increases the risk for normal routes, says officials.
Miller said that the direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been “for all time”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive the gas from the Southern Flow at a lower cost as soon as the project is operational in 2015.
Gazprom stated that the construction should start in other countries along the route of the gas pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Sarat district, the driver of the Peugeot drove off to a crossroads at 115 km of the Odessa-Renie road, and ran into a bus carrying six people.
This is reported by the GSS Press Office in Odessa.
As a result of the incident, the 31-year-old driver of the Peugeot car died.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver had been injured and his leg was jammed.
The doctors gave the woman the first medical treatment on the ground, and she refused to be hospitalized.
The emergency services also examined all the other passengers.
The crew, using a crane, lifted the bus and freed the bus driver, whose leg was jammed at the bus door.

Two YMCA officers have been charged with sexual offences even before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has come to know.
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with sexual offences against children prior to the 2011 charges against a child care worker in Karingbach, Jonathan Lord, informed the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But the commission's introductory statement stated that it had “never been involved in cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director, Philip Hayre, was asked about one case in which YMCA had been charged with child pornography offences and another case in which a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of sexual offences against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Hair told Gail Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He admitted that YMCA, in the opening address to the commission, had also been inaccuracies, claiming that “there had been external YMCA tests, which admitted that YMCA was at the top of the board on children's safety.
The evidence submitted to the Commissions indicates that YMCA was informed that it had received the second of the four possible quality audits conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hair, who joined YMCA at the age of 21, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed by employing the Lord, as well as failed to ensure a clear understanding by the staff of their obligations to report violations of the children's security policy.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hair rejected the assumption that the corporate ethic of YMCA had prevented staff from reporting Lord's violations in the area of child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including the fact that the Lord had been alone with the children, personally cared for them, put them on his knees, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with their mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the Lord's leadership and asked her to be trained to protect her children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she had found Jackie Barnath, the custody manager of the YMCA office in Karingbach, who was the Lord's head, "very frightening and often hard to access."
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the staff members ' explanation that it had been awkward for them to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord led them away from thinking about the need to report him.
Mr. Hair said that he had presented his view to the New South Wales YMCA Board that the lesson for the organization in the Jonathan Lord incident was not “involved in the provision of information” by the staff, and the board agreed with it.
Mr. Hair stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the charges had been brought was taken by the YMCA Director General for Child Care, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent the destruction of evidence, but it was “overtaken” and the decision was poorly implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during Jonathan Lord's work in 2009-2011, and an expert on child molestation from the University of Griffith reported to the Commission.
He said that there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, selection, training, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearing is adjourned until 20 December.
It's a fashion week in São Paulo.
It's not just a model in her home country, it's a real star.
Though Giselle Bündchen had for a while left her job, was distracted by her motherhood, this week and this week's defiance, she came on purpose.
Her absence for months did not prevent her from keeping her seat on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle is the world's highest-paid supermodel.
This time, she was at the Colcci Defile.
The end of the fashion week is usually the most interesting show.
It's kind of something that Leno Villaventura's stylist set up.
Marke has been active in the theater and in the cinema for over 30 years, in parallel with the production of the luxe pret-a-port, and in the design of costumes for many well-known paintings.
In total, over 30,000 firms and companies involved in textiles and the fashion world participated in the end-of-the-week São Paulo.
This is one of the most dynamic sectors of production, with more than 2 million Brazilians working in it, and an annual turnover of 50 billion dollars.
Tony Blair said he'd take the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but he admits that return is unlikely.
Last night, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after 10 years as a leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and to his role as ambassador to the four Middle East peacekeepers.
In answer to a question about whether he would return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said, "Yes, of course, but I don't think that's gonna happen, so... "
The Chief Trainer of "Milana" Massimiliano Allegree expressed his regret for the score in the 10th Italian Tour with the "Lacio".
The expert also noted that the failure at the start was due to a series of injuries to the major players.
I'm very sorry that we failed to win, - quotes the Tmw word Allegree.
The team played a good match, creating 3 to 4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let Lacio do anything.
In the second, the Romans added, but in general, I can't say we lost our concentration.
You had to win.
Last season, we did the task of getting into the League of Champions.
Now we're behind schedule, but this is due to a series of traumas of key footballers.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
The experts of the horse-sporting events who are moving to Cardiff to fight for the Foot of the Year knew that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy who had taken his first steps just a few months earlier, this little boy and his Shetland pony, Toffee, had run three rounds to get the top prize easy, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple, the same height, was rated high for their appearance, behavior, and style at the annual Sannibenk horse sport center in the town of Radry, near Cardiff.
After taking a look at the men and women in elegant hats, he shook his hat and proudly spent the two-year-old Toffee in a circle.
The judges praised Fenton for his ingenious ingenuity of dealing with horses for years to come.
And Toffee got the highest rating for his appearance and character.
Fenton was given a gift to Toffee on his third birthday last March, and he's been studying with a Shetland pony every day ever since.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffee form a beautiful duet."
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a golden cup and a rose.
It was just his second talk with Toffee, and we all loved it when he won.
Completely unknown people in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture of it.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Vale in South Wales, is following the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been running horses for over 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "The public was astonished, and all screamed and clapped."
He ran over the sand the whole length of the arena, and, although he looked so tiny, he did a fine job.
Fenton is crazy about animals -- he likes horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
From the way he started, he will soon be in the Loshady of the Year, and I am sure he will do well.
The representative of this annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The judges commended Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and for the way they introduced themselves to the show.
They're assessing the coherence of the pony and the factory, Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he was really good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper called for “to be reorganized”
The Chinese newspaper, which published a first-line call for the release of the accused in the slander of a reporter, should be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The newspaper New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yunzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on TV that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a public share of property.
Now the New Express has to go through the “complete error correction process,” as the regulator reports.
The order for “correction of errors” came from the Guangdong Department of the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
The preliminary investigation revealed that the Young Evening News Group newspaper New Express had published a number of false accounts of Zoomlio's listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express's manual was disoriented,” states the regulator's statement.
He states that it has been decided “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yungzhou in the form of the revocation of his reporter's license”.
He also “requested Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate the situation-related press and immediately change the management of the New Express.
Mr. Chen wrote a number of articles for the “New Express”, alleging financial irregularities in a construction company called Zoomlio.
After his arrest, his newspaper published on the front page two calls for his release, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television, admitting that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I caused damage to Zoomlio, as well as to the entire news industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he said to the state-run broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized that I was guilty.
After Mr. Chen's confession, New Express released an apology on the front page, stating that the newspaper had failed to properly verify his accounts.
Recently, several high-level suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of extracting confessions in China is still widespread, despite recent amendments to the laws that prohibit the authorities from coercing a person into self-incriminating.
A U.S. tunnel — Mexico for the transport of drugs equipped with its own railroad
One of the most complex drug-smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico has been found with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel four by three feet wide as one of the most complex secret passages ever discovered.
This tunnel, which has zigzags of nearly six football fields, links warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with invisible warehouses, which facilitates the concealed loading of drugs in trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before any drugs had been smuggled undetected, as the authorities had said.
According to court records, law enforcement confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officers, worked as drivers had been charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they would be sentenced to 10 years ' to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major tunnel discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were found in Central Mexico after the marijuana harvest in October, which made it a difficult task for drug cartels to deliver their products to consumers quickly.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards, equipped with rail tracks, from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
In Belarus, pensions have been increased since November
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November of this year and have been reported to BELTA's correspondent at the General Department of Pensions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
As of 1 November this year, the average wage of workers in the Republic, which was applied to the previous recalculation of pensions, will be adjusted by an increase of 5.4 per cent, and the corresponding recalculation of the labour pension, in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the increase in pensions, will be carried out.
As a result of the recalculation of the old-age pension since November, it is estimated that an average of 5.3 per cent will increase.
The average old-age pension will be Br2 million 295,000.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million people in the Republic.
The cost of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of increased pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month from November this year.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of the labour pension in November this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be recalculated as a result of the increase in the minimum subsistence budget on average per capita.

The British Police give Assange a notice of extradition
The British police today gave a notice of the surrender of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who had taken refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian “an official request to surrender” to the police station, adding that if he failed to do so, he would be subject to further arrest.
Assanjoe faces extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his options under British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand it over to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, seeking political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland Yard “trust a 40-year-old man with a formal request to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice,” according to the Spokesman.
He is still violating the terms of his bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the police notification.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible charges of espionage following the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic papers on the anti-secretity website of WikiLeaks.
Driver driving at a speed of 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs is fined £1000
The driver was fined £1000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
A 35-year-old Andrew Howie of Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on track A120 in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take between his legs.
In the Court of Justice of the Court of the Court of Justice of the Court, Howie admitted the charge of driving without due diligence or care.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driver ' s certificate resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howe was also required to pay £90 and an additional fee of £100 to assist the victims of crime.
A tax on foreign real estate owners will cause the London bubble to burst
The Treasury had made a preliminary assessment of the capital-growth tax, but was awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, had introduced a 7 per cent national tax rate for houses valued at more than £2 million and annual payments to customers who decided to own houses in a partnership rather than as individuals.
To date, the state of property in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea districts, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 fiscal year, is already in excess of the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire, and Humberou combined.
Mr. Cooke stated: “After an increase in public debt on high-value houses and associated anti-evasion legislation, it is very difficult to claim that taxing on high-value real estate is understated, irrespective of the influence of the obsolete municipal tax system.”
“But this move may result in some foreign investors being reluctant to buy real estate in London, or the current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of the first-class real estate, the top 5-10% of the housing market at the price, rose by a record 11.8% in the last year in the rich southwest London belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an active “country market” with a boom in the south-west, in the north (7.4%) and in the east (6.5%).
Scientists shed light on the way the dog's tail moves are linked to her mood.
Early studies have shown that happy dogs are waving their tails to the right (from the dog's point of view), while alarmed dogs are waving their tail to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can see and respond to these delicate differences in tailings.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that people in the left and right of the brain have different roles in the formation of agents that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we've tried to look at it from other species.
He added that, like humans, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotion.
To learn more about how dogs react to the multiplicity of tailings of other dogs, researchers watched animals watch movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
We'll probably soon find out why their tails sometimes go in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, "We showed the dogs videos of the dogs, either naturalist versions or silhouette, to get rid of any other distortions, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw that the rest of the unspeakable dog was moving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the tail of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was bowing to the left, again in terms of the tail of the dog, their heartbeat was increasing and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said that he didn't think the dogs had deliberately interacted with each other by means of these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience about which movements they should worry about and which they should not.
He observes: “If there are a number of encounters with other dogs and often one-way tails are linked to more friendly behavior, and the right side is less friendly, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, vets, and trainers a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
An expert in dog behavior, John Bradshaw, an invited researcher at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said that it was not the first study to test whether the left and right side of the dog mattered.
Last year, a group of scientists at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a happy dog.
And at another University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when the tail was to the left rather than to the right, rather than to become alarmed, the opposite of the Italian study.
He said that the difference might be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully accept animals in films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs might be useful, he explained.
“As there is enough evidence for different mammals that the two brain hemispheres are being used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their conduct can be recorded, it is likely that we will soon understand why their tails are sometimes headed in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys is postponing a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's illness.
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her singer had been diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Chieffield band was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Concert on Friday.
However, Alex Turner's vocalist's disease made them move the show.
The group's statement was made after it had to also postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys reported: "After the decision to transfer the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical help from Arctic Monkeys, the show should also be postponed to the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November.
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with "Laringit" and, unfortunately, he is not in a position to speak."
The LG Arena show in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the Glasgow show will take place on November 21 at Hydro.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will assemble the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on February 22, as the Vatican declared on Thursday.
The Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who choose the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually be involved in the selection of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after the cardinal has reached the age of 80, he is no longer able to take part in the pope’s election — the prerogative of the group of 120 “electoral Cardinals”.
In announcing this news, the Vatican Press Secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a meeting of all the present cardinals, known as the Consistory, would be held before the Sanctuary.
“Papa Francis decided to inform in advance of his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from around the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinals would probably drop.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it takes to bring the number of election cardinals back to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The consistory next year will be of great importance, because it will be the first since Francis was elected last March, according to Valero.
So far, there is some kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially for Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from other parts of the world to restore balance,” he noted.
In South America, 40 percent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first chosen cardinals since Francis formed the Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who is charged with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, Dad made his own decision.
“Now Francis has selected eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said that it was “fully possible” that Francis would turn to the Cardinals for advice.
But we hadn't been in this situation before — it's all for the first time.
Valero said that the popes usually appointed a cardinal bishop from the big parishes, but Francis is “full of surprises, so we don't know who he's going to call.”
GM calls off a series of new pickup trucks in the United States to develop seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra's 2014 model pickups to address manual seat back adjustment problems, in line with a Friday's notice from the U.S. Automobile Safety Regulators.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the back tilting mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not meet the federal road safety standards for head restraints.
“In the case of rear impact, the head restraint may not adequately protect the occupants by increasing the risk of injury” is stated in a notice on the website of the National Road Safety Administration.
The recalled models were manufactured from 1 August to 10 September.
The GM pickups began in June and is the most important serially produced car for the leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to the bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration was not in a position to consider a notice to the owners in connection with the 16-day shutdown of the Government, which slowed down the increase in car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which had been upgraded for the 2014 model series, rose by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of the year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares at the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to the $37.47 mark.
Obama’s Voter’s Cry of Desperation
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for possible change.
He says that Obama has allowed Republican obstruction to negate laudable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with the Obama-reformed health system website, drone attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at the Harvard School of Medicine.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would cheer me up in a time of despondent in the second year of the medical school and give me a sense of hope.
It's called the Vigority for Victory, and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patients' reports at night and go to bed, this book returns me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people, and the performances could be breathtaking.
The victory in the elections was impressive, and leading news programs paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates cried out for joy, and my parents guarded all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama's assumption of office in 2008, the level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
A return to the present is a ruthless awakening, like extracting from a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I had no idea.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the passage of the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the lifting of the rule of “Don't ask, don't talk,” the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the choice of public health and the closure of the Guantánamo base, among others.
But after countless times I've been on the side of the Obama administration, defending it in front of my peers and colleagues, I've had no more explanations I can give.
I've reached a point of political desperation.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the permission to listen to foreign leaders or to attack innocent children in other countries by drones.
It cannot account for the collection of data on American privacy by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of incriminators exposing the misdeeds of the government.
He cannot account for the murder of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, without trial and investigation, or for the failure to meet the limits of public funding and spending during the presidential campaign.
He cannot justify the report's findings, which states that the White House's efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.”
Recently, it cannot justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the law on affordable health care was signed.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that leadership can run counter to the political campaigns that precede it?
Evidently, the election process is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and by such incidental events as the slaughter in New Town.
However, all of the examples I have listed above show that they were to a large extent their own choice of administration.
And that's what's bothering me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was passionate about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, and it seemed that he was not in a position to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard for so long.
However, when Obama’s ratings fell below 45% this week, it became much harder to return to 2008 with the book.
It makes me miss a lot of promises that have vanished.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton struck Obama with a stunning defeat in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting to analyse the causes of failure, he told his staff that they must return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
“I want us to get our attraction back,” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to parental leave.
MP Milliardaire Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in the issue of parental leave, because his daughters might become pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnate, who has an unfinished carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement at a time when he was trying to turn his back on the question of whether he had a conflict.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four Senate votes, which may be critical in deciding to lift carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have had a conflict of interest, and said that the daughters of Mr. Abbott would personally benefit from political action.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they get paid leave,” Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer to be the winner of the race for a seat from the Sunshine-Bost Fairfax district, with a margin of 53 votes after the recount.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the procedure for counting the votes in the elections in order to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should the decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
“We need to have a better system,” he said.
Why don't we have a system that can come in, put our data on the computer, vote at once, and get the result at 6:30 the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
The use of pencils in modern times seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibility of electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
The 59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sunshine Cost and would take his new work “very seriously”.
Public office is a service to the community.
“We do not seek any rewards except to thank history for the fact that at a critical moment we can serve this district,” he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its foreign exchange unit, according to two people who are familiar with the situation, which is further evidence that global scrutiny by the regulators of the alleged currency market is fast-growing.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with regulators in the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS officers to be removed from the unfolding investigation, which is associated with the LIBOR inter-bank fraud scandal.
By refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulatory authorities this month.
“Our ongoing investigation of the matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank reported two weeks ago.
Last month, well-informed people said that RBS had delivered e-mail records and instant messages that had been received and sent by his former trader, the British regulatory body, the Financial Performance Control Office (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and is known to have been given leave for his current position as head of the European spot trade in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot tender at Citi, left this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by the Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of the traders had been charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's contact group for instant messages included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the well-informed.
The UBS Bank reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said that it was investigating the alleged currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world — the European Commission, the Finma, the Swiss competition authority, Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Currency Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have conspired to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also begun internal checks or received requests for information from the regulators, who are familiar with the situation.
Banks have been looking at instant messages and e-mails over the years in search of criminal cases.
The verification news has generated a number of trade traders in recent years, which is one of the largest sources of revenue for investment bank trade units, but has experienced difficulties this year in view of the fact that low currency volatility reduces the opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by saying that a vast and highly liquid currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always the case.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trade in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trade platforms and the wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very low price.”
This news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of the traders in the London Stock Exchange's stock trade this week, after it had caused a loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader was acting alone and that the issue was localized,” Credit Suisse reported.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama's Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today held that Barack Obama’s landmark health law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
In a vote of 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the Act on the Protection of Patients and Accessible Health Care requiring citizens to acquire health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional under the Government ' s tax authority.
The Chief Justice, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the Court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy objected.
The Court also maintained the rest of the 2700-page Act and further held that the requirement of the Health Act that the states improve the compliance of the Medicaid programme, or they will lose all federal funding for the Medicaid programme, is not unconstitutionally coerced.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business filed an action to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 season of the primary election, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of the discord?
In the State Duma, in the framework of the Open Tribune, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
One of the suggestions was to ban football in the North Caucasus, because this game is a scandal and a rift.
Speaker Sergei Narishkin recalled the recent events in Biryulov and said that in order to reduce the “grade of social tension” of politics and the media, it was necessary to be correct in the statements.
He probably meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinowski, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they didn't want to limit fertility...
All speakers spoke of measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and of measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which gave the debate confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryul was "a model conflict that could have been predicted," but "we have too many people and institutions to answer for," and seven nanny's had a baby with no eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced with respect to migrants, has, in the opinion of the public, failed, and we must look for our way.
Historian Yuri Petrov put great hope in the new single book of history.
"There is also a need to create a book on the history of the nation's culture so that students in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to criminalize “the calls for the dismemberment of Russia”: “If you say on the radio in the United States that you must hand over to Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years' imprisonment!”
Wladimir Zhirinowski's been trying very hard to "don't light up."
As usual, he blamed the journalists who put the sick and acute national problems on the public debate: "There's nothing to say in the heat of the debate!"
The leader of the One Russia faction, Vladimir Vasiliev, immediately advised the journalists to conclude the “Charter” and agree to talk about the subject carefully and then make the same commitments to the politicians.
We have some 30 laws that govern migration, and the general order has been established, as stated by Mr. Vasiliev.
He gave an example of the law that placed regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-national peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko did not share his admiration for the law: it does not have “a clear idea of what it means to adapt migrants, its mechanisms, and its limits.
Therefore, the scope of these powers will be interpreted in different ways by the actors.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the necessary staff to deal with such complex issues, the means to do so are lacking, and the centre does not provide them with the methodological advice they could use ...
The head of the Duma Committee for Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliyev, proposed the establishment of a special office with the formidable name “Ministry of National Security” to deal with national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s had headed a similar office, which had since been abolished, objected.
It's enough to have a special man at the federal level, a “minister without a briefcase,” to whom you can turn if you need to.
"We're on the edge, the shells are on the side, and it's very important for people of different ethnic and religious backgrounds to stand up to the provocations together, and this work should be well-informed," said the representative of the RPT for links to society, Allvolod Chaplin.
There should be no neutrality of the State vis-à-vis dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, in its view.
Here Oleg Nilov led the debate to a surprise: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, we need to look for more, but they're being pushed to the wrong path, the wrong way," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The footballer is beaten with the whole crowd, the flags are on fire, the comrades are throwing stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another sport - rugby is called...
"They won't be equal in the world in this kind of sport!", the professor said.
No one will play in rugby in the Caucasian! - Mr. Zhirinowski intervened at once.
You're going to offer them a curling!
You need to know the national specifics, it's like offering the Georgian Zaporozian...
In Jaroslavla, the members of the Moscow Club, during the game with the local club, were very well represented by wild behavior on the stands.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the Russian Federation's supervisory and disciplinary committee, Arthur Grigorianz, reported that Cuban was fined 500,000 roubles, handing over from the football home a correspondent from the home to SE, Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions have been imposed on the Reddar Club for arson of Dagestan's flag by fans at the podium during a home match of the 14th Tour against Ange.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a member of the Russian Federation.
We've been looking at all the available material.
For the misbehaved behaviour of the Cuban spectators, he is fined 500,000 roubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei's patent suits against Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the value of which it interrupted at the Northell Bankruptcy Auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which had purchased $4.5 billion in Nortel patents, filed a patent infringement suit with the U.S. County Court of Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawi and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson, and Sony.
Google is charged with violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to compare key Internet searchwords with their respective adverts, which is the basis of Google's search business.
Samsung, Huawi, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones operating on the Android operating system from Google, which competes hard with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar Consortium, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, the key factor in the transaction was the Motorola patent library.
“Despite a failed attempt to buy the patents that are the subject of the action at the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” states the lawsuit.
Rockstar requires increased damages from Google, as he claims that Google's infringement of patent rights is premeditated by the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected president is sworn in
Mohammed Morsi is sworn in, but the day of its celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he took the oath to become the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the shore of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We want a better future, a new Egypt, and a second republic,” said Morsi at a solemn ceremony broadcast live on State TV.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American background from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, for the most part of its 84 years of existence, was a banned organization that served as a target for the brutal actions of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike the Mubarak presidential pump, the movement was stopped only for a short time to pass his convoy on the usually lively road linking the centre of the city to the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi was mocked at as a non-charismatic “rescue wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige has increased dramatically since his victory and Friday’s performance, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but also for all those who want to complete the 2011 rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state,” said Morsi, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wooden panel of the Hall, where he took the oath.
Mursi later went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army band that performed the national anthem, during which he stood at the bar “at all times”.
A paramedicsman, Hussain Tantavi, was present.
His visit was met with the slogan “Army and the People - One Hand”, which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the University.
Founded in 1908 as the mainstay of secular education, the University of Cairo in the 1970s became the wing of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where a rebellion erupted that ended the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and promised to return the office of the president, who had been stripped of his office by a military council that had taken action from a deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take a formal oath of office before the court, and not before the Parliament, as is customary, he does the will of the military, and it is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of theater populist gestures.
A further meeting of the Tunmen Oblast Engineering Association was held at the Yalutorov Automotive Plant.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of electric welds from steel was launched.
According to the business director, Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the steel market in the Tumen region was carried out in 2011 with the introduction of a new owner.
It turns out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric welds per month.
It was then decided to alter the factory ' s profile and install the plant ' s equipment for production.
Already this year, more than 7,000 tons of production have been shipped.
The investment in the factory was more than 120 million roubles, said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new state was launched, thus increasing the range.
The factory produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for the household, small-scale construction and furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
It is planned to reach the level of production of 50,000 tons per year, which will represent about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the move to another type of activity, the number of employees in the plant has not decreased - it is now 157, and the plan for the purchase of new equipment is to increase the number of staff by more than 50.
The company is re-educating personnel, and the necessary professionals are selected from the existing ones.
In the coming year, it is planned to introduce a new long-line steel unit up to five millimetres thick, which will reduce the cost of the product, as well as another plant, at a rate of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the plant is about to learn how to produce pipes that are used in the housing and community sector.
The management of the business is committed to closing up to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tumen region for this product.
The Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy, Leonid Ostromov, in addressing business managers, recommended that more attention be given to the modernization of the engineering industry.
This is also the aim of the forms of public support for industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its lease.
This year, 150 million roubles have been allocated for this purpose, and two thirds of this sum has already been spent.
The last commission to consider subsidies will accept documents from enterprises by 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the cost of the participation of local producers in international fairs.
For next year, a budget of 150 million roubles can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
Five million will be allocated to fairs, three million will be allocated to energy conservation programmes.
Funds for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is made in the south of the Tumen region for the oil and gas complex, are being reduced to 72 million roubles.
According to Leonid Ostromov, this form of support will end in the long run, as the reason for it was to pay off the mineral tax that the oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so, and subsidies are becoming direct expenditure obligations in the region.
In view of this, the Government of the region gives priority to direct support to the industry, not to the financing of the oil industry through it.
The budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace.
Many business managers expressed concern about the current situation with the oil industry.
The subsidy for the equipment they buy is a competitive advantage for the industry in the south of the Tumen region, and if it is eliminated, it will be difficult to compete at the cost of the Russian medium strip, where a cheaper labor force is available.
In addition, the issue of the continuity of the new owner of the RV-TNC, Rosneft, is not clear, which has not yet placed its orders in the tumenian business.
The agreement for the implementation of the Uvata project is due to expire in 2013 and no request for extension has been received.
At the present time, the industry in the southern region, which specializes in oil and gas equipment, is not in a position to form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The open question remains whether taxes from the oil extracted in the Uva region will flow to the region's budget, or whether they will be paid at the place of registration by the new owner of the deposit.
Tomich will work 240 hours for an extremist video on the social media.
The Lenin District Court of Tomsk sentenced the resident of the city to 240 hours of compulsory work, who posted a video of extremist intent on the social network, to the RIA Novosty on Friday by a representative of the Regional Court Press Service.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his page on a popular social media network, which was placed on a federal list of extremist material.
A criminal case has been brought against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, “Acts aimed at inciting hatred and hostility and at demeaning the human person in public”.
“The Leninsky District Court considered the case on a special basis and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime by imposing a penalty of 240 hours of compulsory work,” said the interviewee.
She added that the man had fully confessed his guilt.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians a collapse in the price of goods after the signing of the association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that the country's prices will drop significantly once the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
He announced this to his Facebook readers.
I can certainly say that prices are driven by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
With the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area, the level of customs duties on the import of goods from the EU will be significantly lower.
And that would mean that prices should also go down.
“This is the case for products that come from EU countries,” Azarov wrote.
As for other products, the effect of the agreement on prices would not be so direct; it would be indirect.
But, however, there should be no price hikes either.
So the reports on the billboards, which have recently appeared a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is a price hike, is not quite the case, or, to be exact, not at all,” summed up Azarov.
Investigators check information on ill-treatment of a child in Biiske
On 29 October, the media released a report that a kindergarten teacher in the city of Biyska had locked a child in a cellar for educational purposes.
Investigators are currently investigating all the circumstances, as well as providing a legal assessment of the actions of the kindergarten staff.
After the charge of the mal taste of Evgeny Vasiliev, she spoke
Eugenia Vasiliev, who has received close media attention for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous press releases, both on embezzlement in the Ministry of Defence and on her personally - his relationship with the former Minister of Defence, Anatoly Serdukov, her poetry, and her addiction to valuables.
On November 1, however, the figure in the Defence Service case broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasiliev said, "The original task was, of course, to get any negative information out of me about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a blackmail to get me to testify, or I'd be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Next we go to court, we prove our innocence.
We're 100% sure of the win.
The interview concluded that Vasiliev was probably the most affected by what was said about her taste.
It is possible to refer to the statement made by the official representative of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that the collection of the paintings collected by the figurer in the Defence Service case was forged.
Among the property seized are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident of her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world art.
However, the art expertise appointed by the investigators after the arrest of the paintings found that they had no artistic value and, to put it simply, were cheap forgery,” Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they said they weren't stolen from the DOD, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss some personal moments?
I think it's just a mess," says Vasiliev.
However, to the question whether she pleaded guilty in any of the 12 criminal episodes she was responsible for, Vasiliev said, "Nay, of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there was no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
They just misled people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the Russian Federation that Vasiliev was shirking the examination of the criminal case file, counsel for the figurenant stated that he and his client “were not allowed to see the case file”.
What led to the revelations of the house arresting Vasileva, who had not yet spoken to the press?
Perhaps as a woman, she failed to respond to a bad taste charge?
Or is it true that the reporters of Komsomolki, who claimed a couple of days ago that she had "have fallen into an even bigger trance under house arrest" because of the news of the reconciliation of Anatoli Serdukov with his wife and his return to his family?
A well-known military columnist of the KP, Victor Baranets, in his article "Hearts back to his wife?", wrote, "The followers do not rule out that, after such a shock, she may become more talkative in interrogations."
Previously, Vasileva had taken on certain charges of the illegal sale of real property by the DOD.
Prejudice.

Do you think the travel agents went back because of the Internet?
Flight Centre appears to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and is looking forward to record income from resters in Australia and the United Kingdom.
This travel firm now expects its main total annual revenue before tax to be between $325 and $340 million, as compared to the previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current targets are met, this will represent a 12 to 17 per cent increase over the record return of $290.4 million in 2011-2012.
The manager, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had earned 8 percent of the profit in the first half of the year and started the second half of the year with good figures, especially for weekly trips to Australia and the United Kingdom.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profit in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have record high returns in the full year before the deduction of interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which usually make us the biggest profit.”
In Australia, the entertainment business recovered in the second half of the year, compensating a slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the United Kingdom, Flight Centre's entertainment business went well, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the U.S. has compensated for the losses sustained during the seasonally weak first half of the year, and returns are expected for the third full year in a row.
Last night, the Flight Centre's shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20.
On October 31, the Barnaul police identified two playrooms.
The first worked in the industrial district on the Ice Street.
At the time of the audit, the game was under way.
At the club, there were 24 machines.
Another play club was found in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
There were 20 game machines used here.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation on Barnaul reports that administrative material has been prepared under the heading “Illegitimate organization and conduct of gambling”.
Tech's been removed.
In the near future, the evidence will be sent to the industrial and Lenin district courts.
In Yekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who has brutally murdered two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to the “New Region” in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlov oblast, the day before, in the Kirov district of the Ural capital, after a fire had been extinguished in a three-bedroom apartment in a residential home on Ural Street, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death had been found.
Shortly thereafter, the persons who had died had been identified.
Turns out they're sisters, one of whom is a 44-year-old Yekaterinburger, the second is a 33-year-old Orenburger.
They rented a flat that burned down a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under the personal control of the Chief Police Officer of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities have been working on various versions of the murder, and have tested the alibis of previously tried citizens and persons who are prone to such acts.
In addition, it is determined for what purpose the women had rented the apartment and where they had lived before, what they had been doing, who they had been in contact with.
Schools called for more attention to math, spelling and grammar
School classes in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature from 1914 onward.
The examination will also include “external texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
As of 2015, pupils will be required to take a separate final exam in the language, with strong recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is due to issue new English and Mathematics curricula tomorrow, the first subject to be radically revised.
It will make changes to other core items next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of the OFQUAL exams will present the revised structure of the high school final exams, with a new system of ratings and a smaller number of courses.
Speaking in the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Gove, said that there was “a broad consensus that we must reform our exam system to restore public trust,” insisting that the school final exams would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time in math (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has about 138 hours of schooling.
While there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to the math calendar, the sources in the coalition said that the large-scale high-level school math exams, combined with the higher scores in the rating table, are likely to provide an incentive for schools to provide additional training on the subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be given to “real-life goals”, including financial math.
The Hayhe tickets will cost the tourists 2,200 rubles.
As of tomorrow, tourists will start transporting ships on airbags from the Blademarksk in Heiha.
For those who want to go to China, this means extra costs.
The Puma ticket is traditionally much more expensive than the heat drive.
As reported by the AmurASCO Reference Service, the normal ticket will cost 2,200 roubles.
The passage through the comfort room will cost 2,800 roubles.
By the way, the tickets didn't cost this season: at the same price, the pumas carried tourists in the past spring, and a year ago, in the fall.
Dmitri Medvedev: The rate of GDP growth of the Russian Federation is not sufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev believes that the rate of growth of the Russian Federation's GDP is not sufficient, and he is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business credit and by changing the structure of the Russian economy, with a focus on innovation, reports the Reuters.
We've been planning an increase in GDP in the area of 3% this year, maybe even a little bit more.
It'll actually be a little less than 2%.
With the recession in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but it is not enough for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and in general, a higher rate of growth is needed.
Now it's very important that Russian companies, Russian business, get normal credit at a normal price - that's the first thing you have to do,” stressed the head of government.

Travel on dirt, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients.
There's not a lot of doctors in this West African country -- just one per 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 major heroes to become the hero of the year CNN.
This man will get $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and become unconscious again, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jameth Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection had spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of itself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Georges Bwella said.
If we had the money, we'd have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they might have received.
“It's not easy,” Bwella said.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
By contrast, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413.
And even if the Cameroonians could go to a doctor, many of them would be inexpensive.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health spending is private.
“The only problem is poverty,” Bwella said.
“And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also established a non-profit organization, ASCOVIME, which organizes field trips on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have provided assistance to nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others are loaded in vans, linked to rooftops with medical supplies and traveling across the border to visit needy villages.
It's not always their luck.
On many occasions they had to push cars through rivers and dirt.
But when they come, they're greeted like real heroes: it's a party with songs and dances and the best rooms the locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed an occasion for the festival, and Bwelle is more than happy to join the fun with his wide smile and unlimited energy.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We accept 500 people on every trip,” Bwella said.
They come from all over the district within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics provides a wide range of health services on a day-to-day basis.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches, sunglasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in the school, municipality or home; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-op zone to make room for the next person.
Using the generator to light up the operating and sanitary processing of the equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers are working until early Sunday morning.
This is an inordinate pace, but the team's commitment usually helps support village musicians.
“They've been punching drums all night to keep us awake and keep working,” he said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade return to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, which is made up of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, has carried out 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their help can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia treatment he received would allow him to work again.
“This will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these weekends and work at the hospital, surgeon Bwelle also works at night in private health clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second job, he said, that provided 60 per cent of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest was covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Cathy O'Malley, a second-year doctor at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwell band.
He's either in the hospital or he's trying to make money for the organization so he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the US and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, it is an opportunity that they would never have had at home.
“We've been able to assist in operations where we've been helping to remove blood stains or to keep the tools for Dr. Bwelle,” O'Malley said.
As a second-year student, you'd never get that opportunity in America.
Visitors usually pay for their travel to Cameroon, often with donated drugs.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their food, transport, and training are paid to Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He is giving his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the almost constant workload is not a great test.
Helping others to live a happy life, keeping their father’s promise, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this job," said Bwell.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh to lessen their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see how you can help.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's wiretap.
A member of the Bundestag, Hans-Christian Strebel, met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the interview, it was discussed whether Snowden could be interrogated as a witness by the U.S. Attorney General's Office in the case of a possible wiretap of the German Chancellor's phone by the US Specialized Observers.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary evidence.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, "Gans-Christian Strebele said, "he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, all the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined.
In the meantime, American legislators are beginning to respond to the US spies scandal.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the U.S. electronic intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all fields and areas.
This was stated to the journalists by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Maquie, at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, reported by the correspondent of BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all fields and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, and we have therefore agreed that the public administration of the two countries will provide universal cooperation and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves,” noted Vladimir McKay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions to do so and extend maximum cooperation.
The Minister also reported that another 8th meeting of the Belarus-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, at which time the protocol had been signed.
The parties have drawn up a road map of Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and the search for new forms and directions of cooperation.
“The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am confident that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey view each other as trustworthy partners,” he said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that during the negotiations the heads of the foreign policy departments of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
In the view of the Minister, trade between Belarus and Turkey needs to be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is untapped potential in this area, he believes.
There have always been very warm relations between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
As well, all the necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the success of Turkish companies in the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama refuses to speak of health care
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama yesterday made his repetitive, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are being notified to stop providing services from their service providers, the Republicans have in recent days criticized the president for misguiding American society.
Yesterday, Obama made some of his initial public promise.
“Most people with health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called a “news alert” to stop providing services, Obama encouraged Americans who received the notice to look for other options in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to get better, more comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even less than predicted.
“You'll get better terms,” he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because they do not meet the new standards required by the Affordable Health Care Act.
“Let me say to these Americans that you deserve better,” Siebelius said in a speech to the Washington House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Trade.
Sybelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Health Care Act, said that the launch of the Internet sales site has been “seriously bad” since October.
“I am as upset and angry as everyone else,” she said.
“I really want to get your trust back.”
The irritated Cibellius dropped this phrase, which was picked up by an on-line microphone, behind her, to an aide at yesterday's House hearing after heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives, Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether or not she had to join Obama's health programme.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long once again urged Siebelius to say why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt has been stripped of media status for uncensored war.
On October 31, Mosgorsoud declared the registration license of Rosbalt to be null and void, writes "Lenta".
Roskomnadzor, for systematic and gross violations of the media law, insisted on the removal of media status by the agency.
In the course of the trial, an unfortunate precedent was set: the court considered it possible to close the media, effectively denying the right to issue counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
The “Rosbalt Information Agency” was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most renowned private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications has (and is still) drawn up notes citing sources in law enforcement.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the security structures continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had a vast base of sources in various departments, it was suggested that Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Čerkezov, was the head of the project.
The role of Chaplin in the management of Rosbalt is, however, not entirely clear: it is often called the “project manager”.
The director-general of the agency is Larissa Afonina, the editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulyanov.
In recent times, Rosbalt has not been on federal media ratings, either by citation or by audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the "LiveInternet" status of the Russian media sites.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the website rosebalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), and a monthly audience of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular material in the last five months are the notes of the Kremlin's powerlessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of a soloist of the band "King and Cock", the pogroms in the capital of Biryliv.
The conflict between Rosbalt and Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when the amendments to the media law came into force, which prohibited uncensorship of journalists.
The agency found a prohibited dictionary in two videos published on the website ("Gigit of Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot Defiled Oil Towers").
The next parties are described in different ways.
Roskomnadzor, on the basis of the videos found, accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and requested the court to withdraw the licence from the agency.
In Rosbalt, it was argued that the agency's claim was incorrect: first, the ads were not editorial material, secondly, the language was masked, and, thirdly, the ads were removed from the site immediately after the warning.
The agency appealed the Roskomnadzor claims to the Court of Justice - and when Mosgorsud accepted the Roskomnadzor case on 22 October 2013, the complaints were still pending.
On the 25th, however, the justice of the peace had ruled against Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief, Nikolai Uljanov, had been found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and had fined 20,000 roubles - 10,000 for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the Mosgorsuda hearing - if we gave up the idea that the outcome might have been predetermined earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate Rosbalt's registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It is not possible to say that Rosbalt was left alone in this confrontation.
The Agency supported the deputies of the State Duma (the statement to the head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, was signed by 26 deputies on 10 October; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the CPRC).
The Head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Allvolod Bogdanov, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Gusev, and the Head of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, had declared the publication to be illegal.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, Roskomnadzor’s management even provided him with some assurance that it would not be possible to withdraw the license.
The Rossbalt trial has shown that under whose jurisdiction it is safe to be the media in Russia today is a big issue.
Syria destroyed chemical weapons equipment
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, and recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament has been completed by Damascus the day before the deadline.
Prior to 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other support facilities for the preparation of chemical warfare agents for use by handing over the BBC.
The destruction of the stockpiles of the poisonous substances themselves or their chemical components is due to be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, the poisonous substances are currently in sealed storage.
International inspectors left for Syria after more than 1,400 people died in a chemical attack on August 21, at the outskirts of Damascus.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being renovated.
The next milestone is mid-November: by that time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of poisonous substances.
There's a lot of questions.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully verified by Western intelligence services.
They would be willing to advise the inspectors of new sites for verification if there was reason to believe that Damascus was not fully open.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular forces.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community has demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement brokered by Russia, destroy or disengage all the capabilities for the production of shells, poisoning gases and liquids and for the filling of shells with these substances.
Now that this stage is under way, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already in the hands of the Syrian army.
It is assumed that there may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve and paralytic poisoning, flue mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in a number of dozens of different locations.
For its destruction, it is necessary for the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to agree on a time-frame for action, which will last for two weeks.
The head of the OPCW field operations, Jerry Smith, told the BBC that his inspectors had “personally observed the destruction of the equipment”.
"They are no longer in a position to produce or mix chemical weapons further," he said.
The OPCW statement stated that the inspectors had visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and had found that the factories for the production of projectiles and poisonous substances had either been destroyed or had been rendered inoperable.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to be inspected there, as stated in the document, but the equipment from there was transported and verified by the OPCW.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical weapons infrastructure was “especially difficult” because it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW won the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, it was not time for the inspectors to celebrate it - they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that US espionage "has come unapproachably far."
John Kerry has shown a relaxation of U.S. surveillance tactics, admitting that in some cases US espionage “has come too far. ”
The Secretary of State also pleaded guilty, along with Barack Obama, to being “on the autopilot” at the time Edward Snowden was exposed to the spying activities of the NSA.
These leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the government, have actually taken on some of the things that are happening on the autopilot, because this possibility already existed, both during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, 11 September.”
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that US spying had gone too far, but he stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone too far.
And the president is determined to shed light on the matter and explain himself to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted for good reasons and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We work in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow up people and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building bombings, and the killing of people, because we were able to learn about those plans in advance.
In the meantime, American legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged US espionage abroad and to convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the US, said the president of the Senate's sub-committee on European affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had been talking to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to the frustration at the National Security Agency's surveillance.
“In the interest of US national security, it is indeed important that Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorist efforts,” said the first-time Democrat Murphy, who is the president of the Senate’s international relations subcommittee on European affairs, in an interview from Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programmes.”
The news that the NSA had collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some US allies, even though the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that the NATO allies had been collecting and sharing with the US.
Other revelations cited Snowden's release of documents showing that the NSA was monitoring the German Chancellor's mobile phone, Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Klopper, defended allied spying as necessary and said it was a common case on both sides.
Against the background of this fuss, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit by members of the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and of both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
He said that the programme of the visit was still under development.
While Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some “best-willed hardness” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programs they had been using for years.
“As we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry has to go to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the problems of hostility against the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence.
In the new members of the public observatories, the influence of the prison staff will increase
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new members of the Public Monitoring Commissions (PSCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the lobbyists of the silos will increase their influence.
The ONC is a social structure that monitors conditions in places of detention.
The cases of Sergey Magnitsky and Leonid Razzaev, the upheaval in the Copean colony - it is through the UNC that most resonant incidents are reported behind bars.
The fight between human rights defenders and the lobbyists of the Silos is under way to control the PNC.
At the meeting of the OPS working group on the formation of the ONC, I suggested that the selection of human rights expertise should be a criterion.
"It was not accepted, and it was set up without criteria," says Valery Borschev.
Borszev, the current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, is an all-Russian human rights institution dealing with prison problems.
As a member of the State Duma of the Apple, he drafted a law regulating the work of the NNC.
The OPC Council should vote in favour of the composition of the GNA in 43 regions of the country.
There are less than 1,000 applicants for 1,800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balqaria, competitions have not been organized due to the lack of candidates.
The OP promise to set up a pre-encumbrance for the vacant seats.
The ONC of Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, despite the fact that the new 20 will be replaced by 40 members.
According to Borscheva, in the current composition of the Metropolitan Commission, there are 11 human rights defenders and 9 silos, and in the version that is on the vote in the OP, the ratio is 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to join the Metropolitan Commission.
At the same time, Vyacheslav Kalinin, a member of the War Brotherhood, may be rejoined.
He had been a member of the PNC for three years, but had never visited the prisoners.
Borschev believes that by appointing the Chairman of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the work of human rights defenders will be unbearable, so that human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
In their view, the advancement of the Silos is coordinated by ONC member Anton Flowerkov, head of the “Russia Officers”, an organization that defends the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies for traction," said RBC Daily Anton Flowers.
He denied that he was lobbying for any list and said that he was not planning to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opponents.
According to Flowerkov, he was not even interested in what list was currently being voted for in the OP.
He considers the disclosure of Boschov ' s information to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in the leadership of the Chelabin PNC.
Its former leaders will be suspended because of last year's Copea upheaval.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the management of the local commission had ignored the problems of the prisoners.
On the other hand, ONC Rostova-na-Donu can move from human rights defenders to silos.
Of the new lists, the human rights defender chair of the local commission “lost”, but one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber had expelled him for unethical conduct.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostow Commissions of Borshev consider it a "request to the Copeisk."
The discovery of hope by Tolokonnikov did not affect the Mordovian ONC, which is considered to be “powerful”: only one human rights defender wanted to join the new body, and she did not even accept the documents for the contest.
A member of the OPC, Nikolai Swanidze, told RBC Daily that he had voted against the proposed list because he was resented by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Donu.
He sent out his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague, Paul Gusev, said that he had voted in favour, as he liked the proposed Moscow list.
Co-ordinated the drawing up of the ONC lists by the Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also a member of the FSIN Research Institute.
The Gypsy told RBC Daily that it was not right to divide the candidates for human rights defenders and silos, and did not agree that the chairmen of the Commissions had the power to obstruct the work of its members.
The fungus is not going to predict the results of the OP Council's vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman lodges an appeal against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment on Phuket Island for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on 15 June by the Phuket Provincial Court of a false action following a report to the Thai police that the local taxi driver had attacked on the night of Sunday, 10 June, while the other two men held her.
However, the CCTV later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after a break-up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket Police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
She was held in local police cells until trial.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in the general security centre on the outskirts of Phuketa, not in the adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of a former Australian League player, Peter Tanks, who applied to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help to his daughter.
Tanks said to Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the well-being of her daughter and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“It is evident that this was a worrisome time, but we hope that she will return safely to her home as soon as possible,” said Tanks.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently taking her leave in the Krabi resort in South Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal might result in the court extending her sentence to two years and making her serve her sentence in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to reinstate its eroded tourist image, leading to acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Eltoszeva", translated into French.
To recall, it was this novel that became the finalist of four prizes: "The Clear Field", "The Russian Booker", "The National Bestseller" and "The Great Book."
And last year, the writer for the book was awarded a cultural prize by the Government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Senchin is a clear leader in the generation of the present 30-year-olds and 40-year-olds.
Virtually every publication of its hard-line, based on modern life stories and stories, is a source of intense debate among critics in a wide range of areas.
It can be said that the combined articles on the prosa and publicist Senchin, reviews of his books and magazines create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
In the debate on the works of “one of the most controversial modern writers,” critic Sergei Chuprinin said, the talk is, for the most part, about what the participants refer to as the term “literary,” which is seen in the present and future not only of our word, but also of our life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not make it possible to include most of the articles and reviews from the regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytic and overview articles are usually presented in abbreviations under the headings "Abzazazas..."
