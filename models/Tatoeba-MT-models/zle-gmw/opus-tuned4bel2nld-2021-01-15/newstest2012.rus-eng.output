Parliament does not support the amendment that releases Tymoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in the course of amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to annul an article that condemned the leader of the opposition, Julia Timoshenko.
The amendment, which would result in the release of the former Prime Minister in prison, was rejected at the second reading of the draft law on commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unprofitable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Tymoshenko in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the sentence is the political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
Ratification would require 226 votes.
Libya’s Victory
In the history of liberation, or insurrection, Libya is already a loser.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert, and the war is over without him.
It is time to identify the winners.
Islamists tend to win the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the regular Sharia Act, of which we have heard.
Libya will become a country free of crime, as the penalty for theft is the amputation of the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine, and that is unlikely to be desired.
In any event, our way of life is neither one nor the best, and is likely not to suit the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from non-believers.
Their only excuse is that, in their view, NATO's raids were not led by an American general, but by God, whose majesty they glorified after every blow.
And if Libya is looking for victors, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootouts, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of profit.
In view of the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about the banishment of the "crusaders."
Although, without occupation, would the oil companies get the black gold of Libya for almost no cost?
Probably not, and then the West can finally brag about the unselfish protection of civil rights.
Unless Sharia's followers put an end to it.
A new wave of crisis is under way
France and the rest of Europe are currently at the centre of investors.
A statistical storm swept over Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries released GDP data in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, with Germany and France showing growth.
Still, the debt market today is record-breaking.
Investors are not only looking at Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria, and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have made their preliminary estimates of economic development available in the third quarter.
Germany ' s GDP grew by the expected 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the original 0.1 per cent). France reported a small decrease of 0.1 per cent (the initial information was stagnating).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a pre-growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was stagnant, and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed the trend of slowing down economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was stagnant compared to the previous quarter.
On the basis of preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the eurozone and the European Union have shown an increase of 0.2 per cent over the previous quarter, which is consistent with analysts’ forecasts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary drop of 5.2%.
Its 10-year-old bond yields 28,45%.
The income of both Italian and Spanish bonds is nearing a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to face difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the profitability of the Czech 1-year bond remains at about 4 per cent.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last lender to save the situation.
The Czechs have been selected by EURO.
In Montenegro, they won with a 1:0 score and celebrate an unexpected $200 million cash prize.
The national team successfully met the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and the beautiful voice of Peter Jirachek, they won at 1:0.
In the second half, the Czech team had the privilege of retaining a significant advantage after the home-grown return match, and it will take part again in the European Cup.
IHNED.cz watched the match and prepared a detailed report.
It's almost nothing in the first half, and it's a lot of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, due in part to the loss of the team at the end; the Great Czech; and the heroic Jirachek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Cup.
The superior defence of the Czech team allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments in the second half of the game.
Damianovic and Vucinich were the worst couple of games since they lost two great opportunities.
The great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Cup next year, and the Czech football will earn about 200 million Czech kroner.
From the first moment, the game was very intense.
Both teams had difficulty in running the combinations; the game was most of the time in the center of the field.
This also explains the absence of pressure from the team of masters in the first half of the time, and the long-range blows over the line of defence were carefully intercepted by the Czech defence counsel.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred university students built a human shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In so doing, they want to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, the student prayers in front of the building were followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students built a human shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
In this way, they have demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their own life.
In its most recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that it was clear that Iran had not abandoned the attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, student prayers in front of the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant were followed by prayers for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at the maximum paralysis of the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, the installation in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Eating Obesity Children: No Breakfast and Sausage for Dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 weigh more than the norm; while 9 per cent of pupils are overweight, 5 per cent are obese.
According to a recent study, children who suffer from obesity usually come from unhealthy families.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and the behaviours associated with humans for their or their healthy development.
For example, sausage is almost twice as common on the table of children with obesity as it is in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children suffering from obesity ate fries for dinner on the eve of an educational event called Obesity is not an accident.
In addition, the families of obese children do not engage in sport, but most of the families of modern school children say that only 15 per cent of the children say that their parents take time to sport at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was carried out at the end of the last school year, with nearly 900 pupils in primary school throughout Bohemian.
The Obesity event was not an incident for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company Všeobecná zdravotní pojišovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils in grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Good diet and sufficient sporting activity are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either overweight or obesity.
"For example, only half of the interviewees said that they eat five times a day, on the basis of a lunch lunch lunch lunch luncheon, which is one of the basic conditions for proper diet," says one of the findings of the study.
No lunch and no sausage at night.
Experts warn that even relative details, such as the constant time of family lunch, are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of school families have breakfast together.
Most families have separate breakfasts.
The worst discovery is that in every 10 families, people don't even have breakfast.
Still, breakfast is the basis of the right day's diet.
The study found that fried food is more common in families with obese children.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet, cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly engaged in sports, this figure is more than halved, to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Make a menu of your own.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to draw up their own menus on the basis of the products offered and on the basis of their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the ideal of a healthy diet."
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat, and sweet dishes.
“A particular concern is the high popularity of sweet cooling drinks,” says the final part of the study.
As the main meal, the pasta beat the bird with a small margin.
However, children have shown little interest in beans, fish, and vegetable dishes.
The Strength for a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also showed that children are prepared to change their eating habits on the condition that they are provided with relevant information.
“Many members of the control group of studies have shown a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they complete the questionnaire after completion of the Obesity lecture is not an accident,” states the project's outcome.
This was particularly evident, for example, in the case of sweet, cool drinks - more children started to prefer them to just water.
In addition, children more frequently observed bird and fish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and baking.
Stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals.
In the first article on stylist training, I visited the volume of information in the introductory classes.
I had no idea what was next.
Lectures by three experts in this field; advice on the choice of dress for non-standard characters; and a seminar on how it works in real life.
Next, more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks we expect.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time, with Alenka, the director, (no man in the class), we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfect symmetrical.
Most women are not fully symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other has a boy's figure without proper shape, and another weighs more than normal.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the wide shoulders, extend the neck, or add the missing volumes.
We have been given advice on how to stress the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e., women with a more luxuriant breast and hips and a narrow waist, while not dressing them too repulsive.
For example, if the size of the waist and hips is so big that you can't pick up a skirt or pants, you need to have at least one of the things that you need to make.
You're not going to regret the investment, because ideally seated clothes are priceless.
In a custom-made skirt, you'll feel a lot better than the one that always moves out, rolls up, strips off the waist, etc.
On the other hand, the girls of the boys' figures may wear dresses with rups, applications, embroidery or folding.
Given the abundance of this kind of information and type of figure, I'm glad I've got a whole week to figure it out.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we got.
Each student had to come up with two outfits for a celebrity: a day and a night.
We need to take into account their modern looks, their dress style, and the type of figure.
I'm gonna wear a Miranda Kerr that you might know on Victoria's Secret ads.
I'm happy about myself, because it's a lot easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently recovered a ton (please bear in mind that I'm exaggerating), or a very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the clothes out of magazines or find them online, print and process them with graphics.
The Mudboard, so called the result of the work, then reflects our own style and the way we view the graphics.
It's important to keep the graphics of style in your head.
The stylist not just dresses real people, but produces food pages in magazines (based on specific instructions, such as fancy bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Camenik told us about.
But it was only Sunday.
A Stylist Needs Common Knowledge
The Saturday lecture, full of information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests, experts in the field.
Stylist, Honza Pocorna; fashion designer, Yakub Polanca; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, you can wear your coat-wraith in a normal way, over your jeans and shirts like your coat; but you can wear it on your naked body, without clapping like a dress.
The other option is to roll up your sleeves or lift your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he stressed.
In any case, I most appreciated the following advice: "For your work, you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them,' said Jakub to us.
Here I finally realized why we're putting together all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, whereas in fashion magazines we often see something very different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist should have more design options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So for a fancy view on 10 pages (equivalent to 10 outfits), I have to be ready to create at least 15 images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the item of clothing often looks and works in combination with others in a different way than in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we make an image.
Honsa Obedience confirmed that often image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an astonishing voice, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The treatment of stylist services in the Czech Republic is still quite chilly.
Even well-known people often consider it superfluous (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like is a second thing).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we should expect them to call us a different (lower) size than what they actually wear.
Then we go to Google and see if the tabloids have written anything about some famous fat/dead, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that for a stylist, it was not enough to understand fashion and to be able to find a dress.
Our job is basically to interact with the people we dress; so it's important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to measure people, not to accept them and to hold their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can't throw out all of her wardrobe, telling her that her clothes are awful."
"Find at least a few things you can praise, and advise that you can wear with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that he should specifically include the working bag.
It's a bag you bind around your waist to wear all the stuff you need.
In addition to the obvious things, such as scissors, sticky rollers, or English pins, it should have nylon thread (stylists use it to shoot certain items, such as bags or hats), special clips to bind the tissue on the back in the event that the clothes are too big (bubbles and similar items are prohibited because they spoil clothes) or a sewing kit.
To get distracted from the lectures and to get some practical experience, we've learned to do the right stuff on the soles of the shoe.
Even in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can be damaged, not to mention on the street.
So we started the sticker.
You don't have to touch your boots with scissors so you don't mess them up.
This requires real skill.
I was glad Mario praised my work.
I didn't like the skills mentioned.
That's just part of what we heard in the second part of the weekend course.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist is not that easy to say.
V Need for Speed: The escape takes place in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a careless walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of totally inappropriate and careless mistakes.
Ambiguities had been met to a certain degree, but that was not important, since no one clearly wanted to do any extra work.
Before the new version with the subtitle "Running" went out, there was a lot of hope.
It was expected to move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; the showcases showed that the game would take a proper place in the genre of the race.
We were curious to see the parts of the game where the main character got out of the car and ran.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end, much is different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression is corrupted by a number of unnecessary errors that have been present in this series of games for a number of years.
So, in fact, it's not a mistake, it's an inexplicable laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You're becoming part of a history whose main hero, Jack, solves some personal problems by taking part in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast in San Francisco, and it's your job to get to New York first.
This idea has a number of interesting features.
The route consists of 10 steps divided by more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes its own route, and the individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So it doesn't feel like the game is the same all the time.
Although the charts are at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, it is a pleasure to look at some of the tracks.
Still, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Though it is a pleasure to drive through the desert, in the autumn suburbs, or high in the snowy mountains.
In addition, the race occasionally revives an unusual detail.
In the desert, for example, you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces the visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to get under a hole.
The individual races are fairly well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while you're trying to outrun a few rivals (in fact, a normal race); then you're trying to improve the time (standard race with a second meter); or you're competing with one adversary.
Among other things, you occasionally run into a police force that makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation, where most of the time Jack's running away from someone, and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not a big deal.
Though it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for the game, because it's not boring; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more fun.
The race model follows the tracks of the previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it can't be considered a disadvantage.
If you're looking for a real life imitation, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.
Still, this model of driving is very good for dynamic races, although there are better options on the market.
So far, so good.
But after a while, problems start.
Unlike the driving model, the crash model is not that good.
You don't expect this kind of game to be a complex transformation or a collision, but if you don't know how your machine will act, something's wrong.
Normally, bypassing or bypassing cars in a dense flow, you sometimes touch the other car a little bit, but sometimes, in a virtually similar situation, your car starts to spin wildly.
Or it's cracked.
It's not that important because of the restart system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
Restarts are designed so that if you break up or go far off the track, the game returns you to the point where it crashed.
However, only five re-starts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the start.
It's good if something doesn't work out, but you can't totally rely on it.
Sometimes restarting is not enough, and you have to memorize a separate race.
An important shortcoming of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same place.
For example, some twists have to go in a certain way, or you just don't fit in.
In other cases, you meet a civilian car in a particular location in the same configuration, whether you come first, fifth, five seconds earlier, or a minute later.
This is particularly frustrating in situations where you see your opponent traveling easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you are there, the machines are already positioned in such a way that you need to either cross them or slow down.
It doesn't matter when you're next to them; it's like it's always happening right in front of you.
There are other advantages to rivals.
During the game, you find a number of places where, no matter what time, the same rival overtakes you in the same place.
It's particularly evident at the end of the game, on the long bridge, where you drive in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you no matter what.
The thing is, when he's coming in front of you, he's making you look worse, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand an attempt to make the game more interesting and adrenaline-full, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get irritated fast.
It's a pity, because despite the simple model of driving, the game is fascinating, and sometimes so full of events, that you don't have time to pay attention to what's happening around you.
It doesn't matter what makes you miss -- a concept with fifty unique tracks, a race sequence or something.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the gas stations along the way, because that's what your car can switch on, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports machines are good for cities; powerful American cars are good for direct stretches of the highway; and exotic super-sports for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain tracks.
The main mode of story mode is closely linked to the challenge mode; it is a race on individual sites that you will learn as the game progresses.
Here you win for your personal business, both medals and glasses common to challenges and story.
Many of the possibilities are available for obtaining a higher level of driving, from the machine to the profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with those of other players, and provides public relations.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; it's an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (let's think so) where you run down the tracks in the dark (let's think so).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's say so) when a subway train suddenly hits you in the back, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For a few days, our editors have been discussing whether at the time of the game, no one really thought for a second, or whether the creators really think we're such idiots.
The technical component of the game is not a big deal; but the overall impression from the video series is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
While it is a pity that at some critical moments the quality of the record is sometimes very high, the quality of the record is declining.
This is particularly the case with a large number of participants, where a good record would not be very helpful to you, either.
Sound is fine; soundtrack is on the amateur.
To please as wide a youth audience as possible, the soundtrack's "compositions from different styles"; but it's not likely that a lot of people will buy the game because of its music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: The escape is rather messy.
If the game were to avoid obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that the run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a sense of incompleteness.
Of course, it's a good fun, but be prepared to see your inadequacies blind you as a spotlight at the airport.

Ambassador to the EU Wizenova:
The Czechs have a reputation for discontent and scepticism vis-à-vis the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has given rise to significant disagreements between individual organizations.”
"I didn't expect such a brutal war."
“It takes five or six years before the situation is at least stabilized, calmed down, and all the players get used to their new roles,” EU Ambassador Milena Vicenov began his lecture hard at the Faculty of Law.
She has shown the extent to which her motto “Embark and Open Europe” in the first part of her lecture, in which she described individual EU institutions and their relations, is so simple and clear that many lecturers at the law school of the KU would be envious.
Moreover, Wizenova commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"At first, critics said he was a normal gray office mouse, who can't play any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he did his role."
"He is a man who can listen at the same time to the twenty-seven member countries, who is well-connected with them, and who has a clear idea of which direction the EU should be developing."
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union, which number do I need to call?"; that is, as an important step towards the unification and greater transparency of the Union's policies with respect to countries like China or India.
No one's gonna ban our cheeses.
Vizenova went on to focus on a programme that was key to the EU in the past, the present and the near future.
She called the successful Czech presidency the previous year.
The Czechs had been dealing with an impending financial crisis; they had overcome the crisis and had organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at the time was a negative phenomenon that had caused great harm to the Czech Republic.
At present, Czech representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the Ambassador has said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have led to the ongoing ferocation.
In addition, the new seven-year EU budget needs to be adopted, which is very difficult in view of the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be meagre and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which countries will receive less; all of these issues will be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans that she had brought to Brussels: “O Europe, in a clear language”.
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon, which no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people don't try to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone's gonna ban our kind of cheese?'
It is also planning to make better use of the EU environment and to attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs are regarded as Euro-sceptics; as well as people who point out the negative rather than the positive side of things.
She wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
It believes that several factors are responsible: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters, while at the same time having little support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, it noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what's the meeting about, the Visegrad band again?" And he's not a bit happy about it.
In the future, the Union of Vicenov is largely awaiting new strict rules for the budget policy of the States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considered the idea of a double-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, to be more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone. "
"We have a Schengen zone, and we already have an institution of intensive cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that the countries that want to unite, while those that don't want to stay away."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe," awaits Vicenov.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all member countries, not just those of the eurozone.
Mark history:
IBM's innovator is entering the second century of his existence.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest thing to it is likely to be "long term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded over a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was built by its first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
He believed in his motto that many of the world's problems can be solved easily if people want to think.
His slogan, "Think!", thus became the image around which the life of the future giant was unfolding (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the basis of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means constant movement to the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because it remained faithful to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first 100 years, this has enabled us to transform technology, business, and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more,” says Samuel J. Palmizano, the current head of the company, on the occasion of the Jubilee.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of care for employees as Batya in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees to have paid leave, insurance from the employer, elegant uniforms, and a complex bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship between IBM and the consumer is equally advanced.
From the start, the company had a brilliant application for talented people, which was one of the first global companies to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Concurs with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan under which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked for IBM for 30 years; she is currently the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, which have generated many future innovations.
No wonder there's a lot of ideas - there's about half a million people in the company.
A well-reputed organization
The firm's strong position in the business is a strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning, from the point of view of the IBM concept, was more of an organization than a technology company," said the economist professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business problems by using technology," adds George Colony from the Forrester Research consulting company.
As the company itself is said, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or "Blue Giant", as they call it in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies.
It seems to be the most versatile technology company - hardware and software development, infrastructure, hosting and consulting - from servers to nanotechnologies.
She owns the largest number of patents in all US technology companies, and five of her employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a bar code and a diskette.
With $220 billion in market capitalization data, IBM was the second-largest technology company in the year (the first in Apple), which overcame Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look forward
Not all of its products tasted like buyers and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online; and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is driven by forward movement, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM is easy to lay the groundwork on a few platforms - if they don't work, it's giving it up.
This contrasts with, for example, its Microsoft competitor, who is based on and is experiencing a fall on Windows, his operating system.
Prospect technology
IBM's main revenue is from services, and about one-fifth in each case comes from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990 it was half the size of the capital, it was the best manufacturing company in the world.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, while at the same time it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments during the Great Depression.
Until IBM seems to have harmed the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has risen by record 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have steadily increased.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything but its own values.
So it can be expected that even if another crisis erupts, this flexible giant will deal with the situation.
IBM history: from a cheese knife to a space flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original name, "Creation, Tabulation, Recording Corporation", was rather complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924, the original name of which was the brand used for Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was a merger of four companies, the history of which began in the 1880s.
They owned technology, such as the legendary watch, that is, the watch that fixes the time when the staff come and go out of work.
The architect of the new company was a businessman, Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also head of the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the director of a rival company, to help him run the company.
The manager then put the founder of IBM in the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the basis of a firm culture and identity.
Watson was the head of the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from the name, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, from raw knives and carvings to cash machines.
In the first four years of Watson's management, the proceeds doubled to $9 million, and a major expansion of the company to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that after almost 40 years his son, Thomas Watson, Jr., took his place in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights - to Mercure, Saturn, and 1969 - a man's flight to the Moon.
In the meantime, IBM developed the first family of computers in 1964, the IBM line System 360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time, called IBM 5150, was introduced into the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, at the same time buying the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting office, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high-value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made significant progress with its concept of the Smarter Planet.
Its aim is to make sound use of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned, and to improve the road and urban management.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commons" platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trade cycle.
The IBM tradition is strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, the first country to be located simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also manages a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
Central and eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague, where a world-level research team is also working on speech recognition.
Richtarchova about his unfaithful husband:
Yveta, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarjova (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richter (53), became the bodyguard and lover of Yveta Bartoshov (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rikhtarzhov explained.
When Darina Richtarjov gave her home the bed of Bartoshov in the summer, she probably had no idea what was going to happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Yvette to leave Rizjan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to accept her husband's affair; and now she finally forgave him.
Richter doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
Even if Richter and Bartoshov ever break up, his wife won't accept him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our home, no one's gonna kick him out."
"But he will end his days not as my favorite, lost and found old fool, but as the man with whom I have something to do with," said Richtarjov, adding that she had already been freed from her husband and insisting only on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm gonna be with Yveta, I'm not gonna change it."
"My wife has decided to keep the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union is still in operation; I am in charge of repair, garden, home and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly normal, but we don't share the bed any more," said Richtart to the Blask magazine.
He claims that if he finds a new love, he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she's with, and if she's got a buddy.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I'm fully responsible," concluded Joseph.
Worse women's habits: Do they touch you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad women's habits, they usually list them all at once.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the next line, describing a number of women's habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your second mate complains you go shopping all the time?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping on big sales?
If so, your shopping is a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping somehow.
Still, which one of you would refuse to go shopping for a perfect seated dress and try it on (preferably in different colors) in the dressing rooms?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it can be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your mate to wait outside...
Eternal Dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - maybe I should start doing gymnastics."
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you're part of a group of women who are obsessive about their looks.
Not that you need to stop looking after yourself, but many men are literally allergic to constant complaints by partners about their appearance.
Strong genders also agree that the more frequent such complaints are, the more women are irritating them.
What matters most is order and purity.
It's like an endless story.
Cleaning the glass, cleaning the vacuum, washing the floor, cleaning the dust, cleaning the bathroom - at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for coming to a clean café in dirty boots, children for dirt in a clean sink, and fingerprints on the window in the living room, which was so hard to clean?
If you're suffering from this "diversion," try to realize that it's not good to go to extremes; and that order and purity should not be the first thing in your family.
A harmless desire for purity can threaten your relationship as well as your whole family.
Commanding Strength
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"Are you gonna wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet dish towels should not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner a few times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want it to be perfect.
Perhaps if men had understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Gossips
Some women like to gossip, insult, and intrigue others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk about who, who, who, how, and why.
From time to time, I guess each of us is gossiping.
Let's be frank, that's the nature of all women.
In any event, there are more serious gossipers, women, who often gossip and despise others, who, especially in the women's working group, pose a great danger to their environment.
The results of the Yagra and the Doctor's show helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL game on Monday, the two results of the hockey show, Yaromir Yagra, helped Philly win 5:3 on the ice of Caroline, and he again became the most successful Czech player in the game.
In both cases, Claude Giroux used the experience of a 30-year-old star; he added another show and was declared the best player in the game.
The two successful match shows also belonged to Yagob's team, Yakubu Doctor.
After the match, the Yagrove told the foreign reporters that he had predicted a wonderful evening for Giru.
"I told him before the match he'd score a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel this kind of thing," the Jagre explained, after whose actions Gira scored a goal at the first chance Flyers gave.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a "Black trail."
Circuiting Harrikanes Voraschek took over the puck and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored it between the circles.
A second before the first break, the home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap at a numerical advantage, but at the start of the second half, the Flyers again led.
Especially Giroux.
After his performance, he scored the third goal; his strike was later converted to the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," said the Jagr, commending his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years at the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," added the Jagr.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's penalty, narrowing the gap to one goal.
Further complications prevented Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Proger was doing great in our area."
"He hit the puck, I rushed, and Reed went to the far edge."
"I was aiming at it, and I'm glad it worked," described my impression from the final goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
Defendant of the Montreal team, Jaroslav Spaček, did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an injury to the upper body.
Canada lost its two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomasz Plecanski was unable to kill in one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the home coach was saddened by the large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest of us were young men."
"No matter what, we can't do anything about it, we just have to accept it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement, it was amazing, and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck out of our area."
"What was our weak side," added P.K. Soubban's defender
After 30 attacks, the Czech holkepper Onjay Pavelec helped Winnipegs beat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets' goals, which interrupted the five-way series of defeats, were slaughtered by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea, and Autotourist.
As travel to the West was severely restricted, the travel agencies of the time were mostly selling tours to the socialist bloc.
Thus, during the holidays, Czech tourists travelled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea, Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, which led to significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A major paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually to socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovakia citizen wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was needed from that country; otherwise, an individual journey was not possible.
At the time, travel agencies offered to travel to the West, but either to stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or to have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Currency permission was needed to travel to the West, and it was not given to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; it was not possible to obtain money (Western currency) for travel to the West without a currency permit.
Most of the time the Czechs spent their vacations at home, which led to large numbers of cottages and summer homes, a habit that still exists today.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989 leave to the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs held 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox, which we no longer know, is that before 1989 we were not able to freely visit Croatia, which is now the most popular, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very beginning of 1990 the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring countries in Western Europe was abolished, and this led to a huge wave of short trips, mostly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakia had no way of enjoying their trips to the West, and everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income at the time was insufficient for a hotel or boarding home.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the drive to bring in their own food (conserves, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, and after decades, our tourists are finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income have increased, which has led to another important situation around 1997.
Since 1997, the increased demand has enabled travel agencies to prepare regular flights by charter airlines, and in comparison with the past, air travel has become incredibly cheap because of the ability to order bulk discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all the developed world, except the US, which made our travels even easier.
The next major event in the history of post-revolution travels occurred in 2000, and the high demand has led to the historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have been transporting Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flight from the Czech Republic will take 12 exotic routes.
Today, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US cancelled the need for a visa for Czech tourists, and our country has thus forever joined the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during the foreign vacation, including their spending at their destination.
The General Assembly has to choose the president, the threat of the path is coming back.
For about five months, the Czech football had no president, and there is a risk that Ivan Gaszek's successor, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburka on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on the rules of the election.
Without that, the voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yindrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta, and Tomasz Paclik want to lead Czech football.
When he left his post in June, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong person to lead the football in the future.
However, the era of Gashek once again swept football between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became clear on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
General Assembly delegates had not come to the National House in Prague, Smychov, because the talks had been blocked, not just the election procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote at the general meeting, only the legal representatives or also the officials to whom the credentials had been granted.
This point has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of the State and the Laws that representation based on the powers granted is not possible.
The debate on the rules of the elections, however, is continuing.
Nor did the Executive Council much help, even though it is mostly concerned with this issue in its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary.
Submissions of voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do we get to round 3 and avoid a patch?
“The argument is whether to follow the established standards or find another model,” says one of the vice presidents of FAČR Dushan Liberty, who represents professional football in the association's office.
On the basis of the model provided for in the statute, the winner of the third round is a candidate who has received much support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree to a compromise - to consider a candidate with the largest number of votes in both chambers as the winner.
The Czech side insists on the condition that, in the overall percentage, the winner should have at least two thirds of the vote.
“Then, at least, the two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; that would have completely rejected the concept of the two chambers,” he said, “Freedom agrees with Moravia's argument, and it would be best not to change the rules and to vote in accordance with the existing rules.
Some sudden, Tomás Paclik concurs with his opinion, although the electoral rules set out in the statute estimate that Pelta is more than the other candidates.
"I'd like the elections to be as far as possible by statute."
"I want to avoid all possible representational stupidity, as at the previous general meeting," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is for the first time a candidate; and in his remarks he was largely opposed to Platet.
Pelta is still an optimist.
He trusted that the new President would be known in Nimburca; he also hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"Emotional fermentation will rest after today's national team is expected to graduate to the European Championships."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more cooperative," says the representative of Applenuts, who, out of three, has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Reichl is more tempered.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"This is not between Bohemian and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This could cause another break-up of the general meeting."
"I hope common sense wins," said Rachel.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, individual talks took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was to be taken, among others, by the vice-presidents Dalibor Kouchera and Raichl to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure.
After all, the meeting at the level of the Minister, which is expected on Wednesday, can be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like to see the parties to the country ' s strongest sporting association agree.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; football creditworthiness; and the planned ČSTV General Meeting with a new Czech Sports Directorship after Sazki's financial problems.
Paclik is in the presidential struggle because he doesn't see the right candidate.
If, prior to the Extraordinary General Assembly, the head of the football team, Plzen Tomasz Paclik, had seen a strong candidate who met all his requirements for the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have even claimed a high position.
"If I had a decent candidate, I'd have fought for him and hadn't taken part in the fight myself."
"But a man like that has not yet been found," said Paclik ČTK.
Paclik's motive to fight Miroslav Pelta and Yindrich Reichl is to try to stop Pellet, the alleged favor of the election, from entering the FA ChR.
Moreover, Paclik emphasizes that if he wins, he will not be president until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he'd like this post to be occupied by an experienced top manager, not too involved in football life.
"I've spoken to a number of people who might be in mind."
"It was awful for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they didn't even want to have anything to do with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that view," he said.
At present, the main disagreement between Paclik and Pelta is related to the latter's relationship with Roman Berbrom, president of the regional football association in Plzen, Berber, a man of conflicting reputation, who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, who can influence the votes of the general assembly.
Paclik thus considers it unacceptable that Pelta be president.
"If he wins, the current situation will not change, and football will not move forward."
"With the backing of Burb, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful to football," said Paclik.
He hinted at the fact that a few years ago the name Pelta was recorded while the phones were being tapped in an investigation of corruption; Pelte managed to escape the sentence.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring to football."
"And how we'd look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, and now he's not mentioning his earlier statement that he's "to sell the Pilta Club if Pilta becomes president."
If Paclik wins on Thursday, he might be able to present his future cooperation with Pelta.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reich, who was supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce him to the team."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't have a nose in things I don't know about either," said Paclik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judicial team led by Ludek Mazela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Paclik claims he'll risk running an association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer, he has run the Plzen team, which, with his help, celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to make the football environment change, to support it for the better."
“To limit the influence of certain groups of individuals who tend to influence the disciplinary and appellate board, which leads to abhorrent situations,” said Paclik, who does not conceal his antipathy, for example, to the Director of Sparta, Daniel Krzetinski.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will lobby at the highest political level for more money for sports from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points that the new president must address."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must make clear where the money will go," he said.
Paclik does not consider his connection to the Plzen Club to be a burden, even though he claims that the president of FAČR should be independent.
Pelta is linked to the Appleman, and Rachel is linked to the Prague Dookla.
"It's not the perfect option."
"And yet I don't see any point in the hypocrisy of handing over my shares to the Plzen Club to someone else, if I'm going to go back in six months," says Paclik.
Pelta promised a new FA ChR rule that would make it possible to avoid the Chosen Pat.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for new FA ChR rules to avoid future disputes over the election rules.
Prior to the talks on Thursday in Nimburca, the functionary of the Applenuts remains optimistic and believes that the focus of the campaign will be a significant distraction to the expected success of our football team today.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last General Assembly, and a two-month delay could thus be of use to him to resist his idea of football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"They feel it's time for someone to lead an association," claims a man who is mostly associated with the Yablonese Club, but he spent many years in Sparta and the Association's executive committee.
This gives him reason to believe that he is experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are due to the euphoria that prevailed during Ivan Gashek's reign.
"Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If the different means of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September," said Pelta.
He viewed the rewrite of the key document of the civil association as a false target for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will take on my personal responsibility if this attempt proves to be a failure."
"This is a fundamental issue without which we can't exist," claims Pelt.
In addition, he says he's not trying to single out himself against the background of his rivals.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Yindrich Reichl, whom he valued for legal education; he was well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should be his first vice-president.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Paclik, who was constantly criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for over a year and has made some success."
"Everything, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by the way he was campaigning."
“And so some of them are now questioning his true identity,” he said to his rival, “Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations that he announced in September.
He considers his knowledge of football to be his main weapon, from the lowest-level competition to the national team.
The national team is to represent the entire football team.
"I would also try to put an end to all incidents, starting with the case of the Bohemians or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"After that, I'd focus on negotiating with both the private and the public sectors to guarantee enough money for all the football," a 40-year-old candidate said ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football head would not result in the dismissal of the staff.
"I'm going to need to know the instructions of individual employees." This was his letter to the Insurance, where the long period of power causes a clear nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general meeting, he trusted that the delegates would arrive in Nimburk on Thursday for good.
"If the only question is how to hold elections in the third round, we can deal with it."
“Futball needs the trust that it can only gain by finally electing its leader,” says Pelta, who, two days before the key day of his career as a functionary, remains an optimist.
Reichl promises that under his leadership the FA ChR will become active
If, at a meeting on Thursday, Jeinrich Reich, the current vice president, is to be president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association are said to be dissatisfied.
Richle promises that if he is elected, it will be a time of hard work.
He wants to introduce changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for selected areas of football.
He also promises to address the problem of the Bohemians; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money to football; and to continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gasek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football in general."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national team, professional football, and football events for young people."
"That's not what I'm gonna say, I'm gonna do it all by myself," he said in his interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player, and I want to distribute the powers of the executive committee so that each member will focus on a specific area."
"I'm going to give you a good deal of task, so that in each of these segments, football will take a big step forward."
"It's probably not going to please a lot of people, because it's going to mean hard work, not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly led him to question his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every move," he explained his doubts.
"At the same time, a lot of people told me I shouldn't give up, or others will come."
"It's trust I can't put away," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gazzek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to cross it all."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the Association might return to the one before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something that is hardly competent to Mirek Pelta."
"He's surrounded by people who do football so that it can be made available only to the chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but I'm definitely not a subject."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone's gonna have a good time, not just the chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he denies the charges that he will be only the President of the Czech Republic.
"Although a lot of people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about splitting the second league into the Czech and Moravian sides, the victors of which would continue the fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation, where the league has only three Moravia teams, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Reich.
While the manager of the Plzen Club, Tomasz Paclik, has joined the presidential struggle, Rychl has not dared to appreciate his chances of winning.
“I still have strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its Vice-President, and I see that I have made some obvious progress,” Rachel said, “to his success, it is accounting for the saving of tens of millions of crowns on unprofitable contracts, the negotiation of contracts with television, and the negotiation of a lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was “excluded from the process of re-crediting Czech football,” he considers another rival, Paclik, to be a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzen this year."
"If he is chosen, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started, without significant changes in the staff of the committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his benefit," said Richle about his rival.
Europe’s Most Beautiful Pools
Jump in the water
Julia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest, travelers can test the incredible water of Europe and relax the tired body in the jacuzzi after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder had been unable to do on his research trips for the last 18 months: without his bathing suit.
On her back in the water, she stared up at the taste of the well-formed domes, swam to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired carefully rebuilt swimming pools in the style of ar-nuvo.
She rushed to add each enjoyable pool to her notebook - with important details about the building and the history of the building.
Architecture historian Meder examined more than 200 swimming pools - and has now gathered impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden, where everything went, from the public pools in Munich to the historic pools in the Black Forest and the “functional concrete buildings” in Townus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited bathing in Italy, the Czech Republic, France, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
A 46-year-old author is a real enthusiast of bathing culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sport, says Meder, but in the water it's different.
The only shortcoming is that navigators must accept the blue cassette and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the lure smell of coniferous forests, or listen to the joyous bird-crying in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so awful," said a woman living in Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Splashing in the pool and exquisite oil in the sauna is a health factor in the tubs, because Meder believes that all the feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real joy to the eye if the builders take on this kind of work. "Instead of the pool floor, you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very clear, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All visually reflect: high ceilings, colored tiles, and trams.
The 190-page Illustrated Journey of Bathing contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of oasis of health - and makes you want to jump in the water.
A water collector Meder discovered some outstanding copies during a study in Hungary.
She discovered the rich nitrita water in the Carst Cave (the Cave of the Mescheltz-Tapolt) and the thermal bath, filled with alkaline water, in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfordö in Jasberen), as well as the magnificent therapeutic baths, such as the 100-year-old Secheni baths in Budapest.
Of the many warmed open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, you can see the whole Zurich from the bathing suit on the roof, or you can see the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anton, and there's a window in the steam room to see what's happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design is waiting for a swimmer in Langenfeld, and the Aqua Cathedral in Ectal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, a pair of three open sinkes is coming up, which seems to be very small in the context of the Ectal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Meder's pool collector didn't see the smell of chlorine in every pool.
A lot of thermal baths smell like gray.
The smell causes hydrocarbonates in alkaline water, and the water is almost black from the slur, which sticks to the skin as you sink into the pool, a healthy experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was at some point disillusioned with her search for beautiful bathing sites, and when she tried to visit the open basin of the Czech Dome in Lugačovica, she found that the area was sealed.
The hotels, designed by architect Dushan Jurkovich in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked in the view of the window of the red-and-white-yellow Ar-nuo style, she saw the weeds growing between the cafeteria tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by hot trails, an amazing swimming pool in Schwartzwald, the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Willbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction, and you will find not only the neo-Roman elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also the Alhambra-style Mauritanian Hall, which was added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace, the favorite swimming pool expert of the Iris Meder pools, and not just because it is from the Schwartzwald.
"This is a real achievement - so skillful to combine such different architectural styles," says Meder.
Dumping in a thermal pool in a palace like this is obviously a minor occupation.
Agricultural speculatives
Deutsche Bank investigates trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tives
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann commissioned the working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the world's poor.
The Executive Director is planning to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world's poorest people.
The findings were drawn from a study by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report's author, Garald Schumann, shows that the stakes on the world's commodity exchanges raise prices - and the banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is directed directly against the head of Deutsche Bank, Joseph Ackermann, although large-scale banking houses, such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, are also traded.
Initially, the stakes on the goods were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any event, most experts now agree that the players have given up the rules of supply and demand - and profited from the poorest.
In contrast to the United States competitors, Akkermann responded to criticism, and he promised to investigate the charges, and said that no trade “is worth putting the good image of Deutsche Bank at risk”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes that follow the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may or may not come to an end.
Ackermann's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was thrilled by the news, stressing his critical view of the financial sector. “The stakes on rising food prices are an egregious example of how banks are now unthinkably acting against common interests.”
As the bank's main lobbyist, Ackermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments that make money on food prices from the portfolio,” said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if it's about hungry people or Deutsche Bank's reputation."
A quick reaction by Ackermann at first is surprising, but in the meantime, the Director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before the end of his stay at the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the president would not go to the watch board as scheduled.
Eliminating the controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
It also has little to care for the costs - the consequences will have to be borne by its successor.
One out of the other would not invest in the goods.
Foudwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, over 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, which was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
No more than 11 per cent believe that the investments that place a stake in the food price are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such trade, and one in two, according to the study, would withdraw the deposits that eventually led to the speculation of the goods.
Forty-three per cent would have recommended leaving the bank, and 49 per cent said that they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st-century home in Vienna
A Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Winsowski
An architectural history of ups, downs and downs, and a happy end: the Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World Exposition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was emptied, and was abandoned.
Now it's re-opened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Carl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exposition in Brussels, is a well-known example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, which have been bold in expressing confidence in technological progress.
Svantser's Pavilion conquered the Grand Prix in Architecture in 1958 for its light swelling structure of steel and glass.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built an Austrian pavilion at the next World Expo.
After all, he was famous for the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and her sister, a cup-shaped building.
The pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near the South Station of Vienna, transformed and opened as a museum of the 20th century in 1962 - and is often referred to as the 20th-century House for that reason.
In any event, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls on which to hang works of art, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna was given a new home.
The house had been empty since 2001, and his condition was getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has so far renovated a pavilion called the 21st-century House and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is a branch of the Museum of Belvedere, which will open the first exhibit on Tuesday night, in all ways a joyous event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Bellveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a figurer in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, persuaded politicians and keepers to continue with the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was to contain a permanent display of the Fritz Wotruba Foundation, the Café and the Bookshop, along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict control of & limited budget
Krishanitz was then the perfect candidate for the project.
He was famous, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secsion, Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied from Schwanzer at the University of Technology of Vienna, and the pavilion was a "exclusively important place" for him to attend the "almost weekly" exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the challenges that the building was facing, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and ease when it was moved to Vienna and converted.
The problems that had arisen during the last reconfiguration were much more serious, and the building was an energy absorber, says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade had been replaced, the glass-enhanced safety window had been inserted, and the glass roof had been replaced by a high-powered safety window.
The steel junctions of the heat bridge had been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos had been removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors have created space for new use of the building, and the fall of a light well between the building and the street provides light - a virtually new building, but still a delightful Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors had been kept, and the building had been painted in the old red-brown color of protection against corrodation.
The theater hall is the same as it used to be.
All of this is under strict control of museum management and with limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and would have been approved by the museum office," says Krishanitz, pointing to a ragged floor in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite constraints, challenges and transformation.
Krishanitz recently noticed that the "Brussels" pavilion was rude - a typical story of "copling in the city."
Such an architecture is “always out of place” and still wants to “stimulate real awareness”.
The 21st-century home is in the right place, because the city's planning has had an unexpected turnaround, a fully rebuilt “head station block” with offices and real estate growing around the Swiss Garden.
The 21st-century house may be supplemented by the second building of Krishanitz, collector Francesca von Habsburg, who has acquired the Berlin Temporary Expo Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city about its location next to it in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multi-million-dollar winter crisis package
Deutsche Bahn released a crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in the winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million Euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and late trains.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn's internal crisis plan, the newspaper Bill reported that a total of about 300 million Euros was scheduled to be invested by 2015.
Investments are designed to improve the performance of locomotives and the rail network even under extreme weather conditions.
The number of in-house and engaged staff involved in the clean-up of snow from tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before work and 90 per cent of the required shooters within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancelling and late trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties in passenger transport, as it lacked reserves at the time of the deterioration of the weather.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in the ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the axis of ICE trains much more frequently for many years after one of the ICE trains had broken off at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay a lot of millions of pounds of fine in the United States
New troubles followed the upheavals around Joseph Ackermann, Director General of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a fine of £1 million in the United States.
As if Deutsche Bank had little trouble in his home country, the past industrial giant in the United States had come after him. Deutsche Bank, with its head office in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million euro) to calm the disputes that arose after the bankruptcy of the five largest credit unions.
The problem was the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of the bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and pulled down credit unions.
"We're glad to have solved this problem without the parties going to court," said Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank did not plead guilty in the agreement.
The same is true for Citigroup, who has agreed to pay $20.5 million.
The president of NCUA, Debbie Matz, welcomed the prompt reaction of both banks.
The National Credit Union Office (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and interferes with the bankruptcy process to protect consumer deposits.
The NCUA is fighting to compensate for the losses from billions of dollars.
This is the first agreement of this kind.
The manager also drew attention to other major banks and in the summer brought a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Dubious mortgage bonds are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
They're backed up by internal loans.
This determined the fate of a number of financial companies when the real estate bubble exploded in the United States in 2007.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life on the brink of the financial crisis in September 2008.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have made a large number of claims, claiming compensation or punishing fraudsters.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It blames the 18 largest international banks for having purchased some $200 billion in bond from American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank is also at risk of being prosecuted by the FHFA for the numerous agreements, with a total value of $14.2 billion, concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a bank with a head office in Frankfurt to take responsibility for “substantial losses”, but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche The Bank dismissed the claims as groundless and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM
Buffet's financial guru is actively investing in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares totalling over ten billion dollars.
So far, the largest American investor, Warren Buffet, has always claimed that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, as their long-term development is hard to predict.
However, IBM's annual report changed his view of investing in the industry.
According to Buffet, he should have known much earlier that IBM was the first to offer services and buy computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment was viewed as a knight's deed.
IBM, an IT-industry veteran, has now won the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with CNBC, Buffet reported that he had purchased IBM shares totalling $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM shareholders with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffet said that even IBM had known nothing about his involvement until recently.
He commended management, which had managed to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
"They did a lot of work," said Buffet, with a management strategy.
For a long time, IBM focused on high-income IT services such as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffet has been avoiding tech companies.
He claimed to invest only in those companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, the production of lubricant and engineering.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway holds shares in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Munchener Ruck), along with some 80 of his own subsidiaries.
An 81-year-old bought a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built it as one of the world's most expensive companies.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
made it a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct to make money brought him the nickname "Oracula of Omaha."
IBM shares rose by one percent before opening markets after Buffet's investment announcement.
The "Blue Giant", also called IBM, is on the stock market for over $220 billion, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
Inescapable danger
After the identification of the Tswickau Cells, the Turkish media began to question the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers is talking about a "blooded ideology," which is resurrecting the surface.
The murder of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a response to this report in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has led to long-forgotten fears, such right-wing extremist attacks on the Turks have not occurred since the fires in Mellin in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There had never been any doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has now been discovered is of a magnitude that is not yet fully understood.
"Resurrection of a bloody ideology?" was the headline of the Internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret informant for the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be dragged into the right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, remembering the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin, at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians, celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral labour contract.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
Coverage in some Turkish media was like a slap. "German's 50th anniversary gift" is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriet, too, did not miss the opportunity to draw this parallel.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulahji.
He noted that people had been killed who had paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany by their work.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful hijacking had been severely criticized on the German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought before of following suspicious persons in right-wing extremist circles.
Some writers have reached a rather sharp rhetoric. “If they continue to act as clumsy as they are, migrants will have no choice but to use armed self-defense.”
"It'll be the best self-defense."
"The world in Germany is very much dependent on how the whole network will be opened up, and on the legality of the punishment," writes Selen.
The crimes in Mellin and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to the world in Germany.
The picture of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply recorded in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
No other event has shown so clearly to the Turks here that they are in danger, and to the Germans that distrust and apathy can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the failure of the German police following the attacks, and Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mellin.
He sent a telegram of sympathies to the President of Turkey after the arson in Zolingen, but his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel, took part in a memorial ceremony in Cologne in his speech to calculate the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It's like he's defined the value of a person by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how many German Turks have since become more distrustful of the current German state.
By clearly demonstrating what needs to be done now, in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal on Lake Zurich
Most of Europe’s top risky banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS is almost bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been constantly fighting one or the other crisis ever since.
Now the German must return him to the right course.
Alex Webber probably didn't know he'd get that part.
In July, after his impressive retirement as head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would take up an equally impressive position, the chairman of the board of directors of the largest Swiss bank, UBS, and a sudden and lucrative career move.
Alex Weber was clearly thrilled, praised Switzerland for its beauty, the UBS for its newfound strength, and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS managed to change for the best."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel."
But it became clear in September that things would be different.
The UBS trader in London beat the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euro.
Osvald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave the United States Executive Director.
Since then, the president of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered ill, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Weber finally take over?
Webber is to advise the bank as of February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he'll be chairing the board in May, not in 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Weber.
He's an economics professor and a Central Bank specialist, not a traditional banker, and he's definitely gonna need time to adapt.
He suddenly found himself responsible for the bank's strategy, which once again proved that he had long earned the rank of the “greatest bank scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, is very big - until recently, it managed the world's largest assets - and, on the other hand, it hasn't come out of scandals for years.
It seems that a proud Swiss bank spares nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had a great reputation.
The bank combined the image of a secretive and stable but sloppy asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become the largest player in an investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, so that it had more money in the management of wealthy clients than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, he joined the league of the world's largest banks.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and a longtime professor at the University of Zurich Institute of Banking, explains: "I've always given my students the UBS as a model of a good bank."
"Knowing what we know right now, you can ask me how I could have been so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was going wrong in UBS.
In mid-year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and, to the same extent, a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The bank's investment unit tried to play on sub-standard securities and had to write off billions.
Believe it or not, the UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to confront the crisis.
The bank was indeed able to find investors - but investors whose services many bankers would have politely refused - one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so secretly that even the name of the fund was not announced.
It was just the first punch.
In April 2008, things got a lot worse.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses, and Marcel Osple, the president of the Board of Directors, the second-largest president of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, a disaster broke out, and because of a lack of investment during the financial crisis, the UBS was at risk of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank purchased toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a binding conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked to see the dramatic consequences of having huge banks in a small country.
After all, the total balance of UBS in 2007 was five times as high as the total production of Switzerland (see graph).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says the bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and stated that it was ready to pass data to wealthy clients who might have been tax-executed by the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay 780 million dollars, which consisted of recovering unsubstantiated business income plus fines.
UBS thus more or less acknowledged that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, the UBS lost what was always his advantage in the fight for rich clients - the veil of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same as it was before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The client's money has begun to run out.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both of its main activities - investing in failure to speculate and managing assets as a result of aid and the promotion of tax evasion.
And it just calmed down, and it seemed that the UBS had managed to break the situation with the treacherous fraud, and one single trader had lost 1.7 billion euro before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
“The incident with Adoboli made it clear that risk control had not changed enough,” says Martin Jansen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks, too, has no doubt: "The problem with UBS is that he has no risk control tool."
It is caution that has long made the Swiss bankers the custodians of the world's largest assets - not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether or not the world has collapsed outside the Alpine Republic.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of firm trust, as Lindt and Sprangli symbolize the refined taste in chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still corresponded to the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, but it was a bit more.
Her position is a classical one.
The head office of the bank is located in Zurich, in Bangoffstrasse, which is leading from the main station to the Zurich Lake, surrounded by snow caps of the Swiss Mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rent for the stores is one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores like Confiserie Springli, you can find such jewellery companies as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been based here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Creedy Suisse Palace and elite private banks, such as Julius Beer.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls, there are big leather sofas next to the bank's big sign "Safe."
The UBS knows what his clients need - reliability.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned the Swiss concept of banking - or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper - like all the Swiss bankers, he's also working with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big - particularly in an investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his view, the Swiss had nothing to add.
"And if there is something, then they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon custom."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, made it the first big profit - and then fiasco - that no other financial institution in Europe lost so much money in the jungle of subprime assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became evident on 15 October 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million made the largest rescue operation in the history of the country," writes Lucas Hessig in his book The Crack of UBS.
Politicians have approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euro) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to that?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they'll say that the problem is mostly the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined in a major group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which at the time of the merger was too big for a small Switzerland, and a bank that continued to grow.
It also helped that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other, and one was a rich but high-level bank specializing in the management of assets in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a lot of money that they could use to drive an all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Woolffley, the executive director of the UBS group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Osple, the chairman of the board of directors.
"I always thought Woolffly and Osple was a dream team," said bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wolfley, an outstanding intellectual, is a modest and profoundly understanding model and statistic, and the Osple with his inner instinct, has come all the way up, starting with an intern at the bank."
But Osple eventually put his trust in Wolfley.
And Wolfley might have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
The UBS remembers very well the meetings of the board members at which Woolffly always echoed the same motto - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he led the "Tourning Table" to which banks had made progress.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make a part of the way.
UBS was the largest player in currency and public securities.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot: by the parameter that is termed “continuous income” in banking terminology, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failed in American mortgage products.
To shut the hole, the UBS was involved in an adventure that almost cost him his life.
The bank itself and its hedge fund invested in sub-standard US securities in order to grow.
This developed into a large mechanism that combined securities based on American mortgages and sold them further - keeping the risks on its own.
Even when other banks had long been looking for a way out of the process, the UBS did not stop.
"UBS bought up to the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire," says the bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as the attempts to clean up the bank were harder than it was at first.
The posts in UBS have become a children's play with chairs and remain unreliable until today.
Anyone who runs this huge bank is facing an almost impossible task.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Bank analyst Geiger already has the idea of giving up investment banking, focusing on asset management, and forgetting his Swiss origins.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment must be significantly curtailed.
The new head of the Bank, Sergio Ermotti, is planning to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was in fact viewed only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
In the past, he has been able to show character and, as the Zurich Bank stated on Tuesday, he is now heading UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti is planning to return the investment bank to the state it was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions must be Axel Weber's.
Publicly, he still said that he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of a recession in Europe is dragging down the US Stock Exchange
The coming recession in Europe has made US investors more moody at the beginning of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The collapse of industrial production on the continent has overwhelmed the hope that the debt crisis can be overcome in the embryo.
The general relief that followed the shifts of governments in Rome and Athens was not backed up.
The euro fell relative to the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek cups were still considered half-full, not half-empty - but now the problems are back to the top, said Mark Luskini of Janey Mongomery Scottt.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on the sales list.
The Dow Jones industrial index closed at 12.078 with a drop of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer in the course of the tender ranged between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The larger S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, falling by one percent.
The Nasdaq technology index lost 0.8 per cent, trading on 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 per cent, closing at 5,985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro-zone countries has significantly reduced production and is adapting to the end of growth.
The Eurostat Statistics Service reported that in September companies had produced two per cent less than in the previous month.
"We're not on an island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe is unlikely to quickly shake the recession and that banks are showing further signs of weakness.
In an interview with CNBC, the legendary investor Warren Buffett said that it was not clear whether Europe was strong enough to do what was needed to end the crisis.
So, in his view, it was too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffet threw a ten-year-old principle in the trash and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His IBM investment of more than ten billion dollars raised the value of the shares of this oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The stock closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.
Buffet stated that he had paid an average of $170 for the share and now had a share of 5.5 per cent.
The value of his investment company, Berkshire Hathway, fell by 1.3 per cent.
Bank of America stock fell by 2.6 per cent, much more than the market.
The bank converts into cash almost all of the rest of the Bank of China's share of the Bank of Construction to $6.6 billion.
The Bank is primarily planning to support its capital quota with net sales gains to meet stricter standards.
Boeing won by reducing the loss on Dow-Jones.
The value of the shares rose by 1.5 per cent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-range jets in a series of 777 totalling $18 billion.
Including the option to buy another 20 planes, the total is actually $26 billion.
Some 710 million shares have been replaced by the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares of 719 companies rose, 2,281 fell, and 79 remained at the same level.
A total of 630 companies finished their bids, 1913 fell, and 82 remained at the same level at Nasdaq, with a turnover of 1.38 billion shares.
Smart crows fill cities
Today, experts say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to be banished from cities.
Some like birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and the crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but the population complaining of dirt and noise is growing in many localities.
The problem of birds, however, is far from being solved.
At the first symposium on ravens in Lear, in East Frisia, experts argued that it was no longer possible to banish the Grachey from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Searching for urban alternatives
Conservatives argued that the root of the problem in the cities was the migration of specially protected bars, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture had increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
Hunting, the growing construction and cutting of traditional nesting trees have made it more difficult for birds to live.
The crows are under guard.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest in Yever, Dipholz, Achim under Bremen and Lera, there are large colonies with more than 600 parent couples.
A mixed project to shoot the crows in Lera led to disapproving headlines in 2005.
Critics described catching birds in traps and slaughtering them with sticks as particularly cruel.
"The usual move and frighten don't do anything." said the architect and landscape designer Werner Klever of Lera.
Breaking nests or cutting trees often have undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"Livables dissipate, and large colonies divide and spread to other areas."
Discouragement is possible only on an exceptional basis near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We're gonna have to live with them, and getting rid of them is not an option."
In isolation from the surroundings, the urban problem will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kellner.
A combination of frightening birds from protected residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"The information stands instead of the chain saws" was a slogan put forward by the psychologist and ethnologist Utoya Maria Jürgens, who is in favour of a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be sure of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information on the life of very smart graches.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jurgens also gave her opinion on complaints about the noise made by birds. "The sound of the sound is a lot of information, and they have to say a lot to each other."
The brains and the wits of these birds have come into legends, and not only do they use guns to take over a bit of it, but they also make guns themselves.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the magnitude of the avian mind on four grams.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they had to knock on the board to get the mold larvae.
Without much training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the tablet.
In another experiment, intelligent graches had to deal with a more complex task.
The researchers put a small bucket of mold larvae in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get a prey with a beak.
But the researchers gave them fragments of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and hooks to hold a bucket by a pen and get it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four had done it since the first try.
Ronaldo is taking Portugal to Euro2012
The hope of the Bosniacs and the Turks to win at the last minute was long overdue.
The Favorites of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the last seats in the Euro2012 Championships in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the leadership of the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored for 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina with a score of 6:2 (2:1), perfected its fifth entry to the euro after 0:0 in the first stage.
The Czechs had enough to be 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of playoffs against Montenegro's outsider after a pure win in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss its chance by playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloza (80th) scored the rest for Portugal.
A former professional player, Bondsligi from Wolfsburg, Staran Mishimović, and Captain Emyr Spahic, reduced the difference by two points, thanks to a 41st-minute effective penalty and a goal by 65th after Bosnia.

Portugal has already beat Bosnia from the 2010 South Africa World Cup.
Portugal made a great start at the Lissabon Estado da Lus.
Ronaldo took an early start with a free shot at the gate from about 30 meters.
The good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-distance abilities, from a 25-metre point, increasing the score to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who had not opened the account in the first half an hour, had their first chance thanks to the attacking Edine Jaco.
A former Wolfsburg player from the English championship at Manchester City for 33 minutes sent the ball head to the lower end of the pants, but the ball did not cross the line of the gate.
Jirachek scores for the Czech Republic
Then the focus was Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
Following the attack on Elder Postig in the Bosnian penalty spot at 36 minutes, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was simulating, and showed him the yellow card.
Stark also sentenced a dubious penalty for playing the game with his hand after the foul of Fabiu Quantran-Misimovich made it.
After the break of Europe's 2004 Vice-Champions, four more scores were added.
Peter Jirachek dispelled all the remaining doubts about the Czechs at the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships are the fifth in a row.
The team of coach Michael Bilek and the Legionaires of Boundseligi Michael Kadlecz (Bayer Leverkuzen) and Thomas Pechart (1st FK Nuremberg) also smiled after an error at the very beginning, which could have become catastrophic.
The porter Peter Chech for the 9th minute, thanks to the instant reflex, prevented the potential tomash Siwok's autogole.
Montenegrin's best chance was when the duo of Stevan Jojetić and Dejan Damianovic was on the field.
Damianovic struck from the edge of the ticket at the 40th minute and almost scored a goal for the Chechen.
After a break in the pants saved the already beaten-up Czech world-class Hollywood after the forward FC Seoul left the field for 50 minutes.
The win-win goal was hit just before the final whistling.
In the meantime, Turkey did not have enough football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks failed to play better than the 0:0 in Zagreb.
Although there is little doubt that the coach of the Hus Hiddink team will now vacate a seat on the bench of the team that reached third place in 2002, the Croats find themselves for the fourth time in the final round of the European Cup.
The Turks almost got a perfect start in front of the 31,000 viewers at the Maximir Stadium.
The long-distance strike by Seljuka Inan hit the bar for seven minutes, and the attacker, Kazim Kazim, failed to beat the ball off the net.
After that, Croatia woke up and was increasingly taking control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in perfect form.
The Legionaries of Boundseliga, Daniel Pranic (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Shieldenfeld (Ainthrat, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukic of the Wolfsburg team, who gave over to Ivan Perishic of Dortmund for the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is on his way to Euro2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro entry after Germany in 1988.
The team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already looked confident in her place after the 4-0 win in the first stage, took the lead for the 32nd minute thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Constantine Vasiliev of the guest team equals the score for the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the start, but it was only at the 23rd minute that Robbie Keene from Los Angeles made the first clean bare punch.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from leading Ireland forward.
The goal was full for 32 minutes.
Bypassing the protection of the Holidayer Paul Londack, Ward found himself in the right place and, by putting the ball across the line, changed the score by 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software producer in Europe, SAP, is planning to invest billions and almost double the number of its employees in China in the next few years.
A company on the Dax list announced on Thursday that it was about to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euro) by 2015.
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and employ thousands of people," said Bill McDermott, one of the CEOs of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
A state of 2,500 is expected to grow to 4,500.
The world market leader for industrial software plans to double the number of his offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chendu and Dalian.
This country, which is experiencing an economic boom, has about 4,000 SAP clients out of over 176,000 worldwide.
China's growth rate is an important component of the 2015 strategy of this company, which is listed in the Dax.
SAP plans to increase its turnover to Euro20 billion by 2015.
Last year, a company from Waldorf earned about 12.5 billion Euros.
The software provider, with 55,000 staff worldwide, looks better than ever.
SAP has been in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to change the scale of our operations," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on information in China."
Massacres - human dimension
Peter Englund's stressful and very good new book "The Beauty and Pilgrimage: The Personal History of the First World War" begins with a long list of actors that kills the heart.
Here's how to read next: cut this page carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund speaks, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon at a time when, like one of these men and women, you will get off the road and get lost in the mist of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which is awarding the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book that he's writing now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as "work on anti-history."
There are few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are hardly any ambassadors, sloppy journalists, or discussions of tactics and combat technology.
It's not so much a book about what happened, - he explains - it's a book about what it was like.
The book "Beauty and Pilgrimage" combined the experience of 20 more or less unattractive men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone's gonna go into captivity, lose a hand or a leg, go crazy or die.
Their lives are flickering here like church candles: new ones are added to a lot of others, and some are fading at the time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is also an amendment to the idea that the First World War was just a gravel war on the West Front.
Beauty and Pilgrimage provides a skillful panorama of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are hit by bee hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is the tsetse fly.
It's an exciting book, almost from the start.
War covers the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smokeless gunpowder.
When you're at home with the children, are you going to stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on or why we have to fight in this war.
“The lack of facts,” observes Mr. Englund, “is filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
Beauty and Pilgrimage traces the fate of people like Florence Pharmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young mariner of the German High Seas Navy.
Their stories are drawn mainly from memoirs, letters and other material already published.
The accounts of their lives may be frightening or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to the small moments and fragmentary details gathered by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with it.
Telling the history of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzaz, everywhere is an ersa."
"Replacer, forged aluminium, false rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He keeps talking about the eszac food in Germany.
It describes “the meat of pressed rice welded in ovine fat (and decorated with a false bone made of wood); the tobacco made of dried root and dried potato skin; the footwear cut by a tree”.
He notes that there were “837 registered meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausage, 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories speak of honour and courage.
One American observes the most violent passion in himself and talks about war: "You feel that, after all, that's what men have been created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, an evening paper or a bestseller, and to say that this display is a civilization, and under your shiny shirt with a cap is not a barbarian."
The British soldier, on the contrary, observes that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
"When a person accepts the idea of self-sacrificing, he'd like to think it's gonna happen in front of the public," he writes.
But it's the other way around, it's like a "convicted man who's been hung up secretly."
Other comments concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new types of fear.
"The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "the war factory."
He points out the coming of someone he calls "a new kind of bestiary of the beginning of the century: a well-expressed and ideologically-convinced mass killer in a well-mixed suit that organizes a carnage at the writing table."
People act in an unforeseeable way: low-level actions are just as heroic.
Mr. Englund described the soldiers who had tried to pick up sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes in order to escape service on the front.
"The most grand expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhoea, which the soldiers bought and smeared in their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
"Every desperate slammed it in the eye, which often led to life's blindness."
Translated with the Swedish Peter Graves Proza by Mr. Englund, a flexible but non-bromish, perfect for his humanistic mission.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how the war “have freed completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are starting to ask why their leaders make them fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fassel or novels like "On the West Front Without Change" by Erich-Marie Remark, rather than by complete historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unshaped pantheon.
His book has the most amazing finale I can remember in uncertified literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he reached out of a book with a list of characters, got it out of your hands, and set it on fire with a match.
After the previous error, a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers, some wearing protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The night watch from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zukotti Park was supposed to have the least people at that time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, and the others were first told that they were on their way to the training.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the events, and his presence highlighted how much the Department of Police attached to the operation.
There could be no repetitive episode of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which ran counter to the Department's rules and caused a storm of public sympathy for the occupier.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to release the Zukotti Park protesters.
The authorities were preparing to watch occupations unfold in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on the island of Randalls, with a view to the Zucotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - with reference to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute," told a source who was familiar with orders that only referred to the task as "training."
"The few cops I know who have been called to this case have not been told that they're being sent to Zukotti Park," said this man, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zucotti Park were at the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated to hundreds of protesters who had rushed in before the deadline, hearing about the plans.
On Tuesday, the operation involved members of various police units, including those from the districts, the police teams, who were usually used to control the criminal area.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like work, come and go out of the park during the day, making 1:00 a.m. an appropriate time for an attack.
"It was right to do it when the park had the least people," he said.
Rescue vehicles with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The spotlights and prerecorded ads coming out of loudspeakers seem to have terrorized many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue windshields, many protesters simply packed their stuff and left.
The police reported that the tents had not touched until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters time to pack up.
Other police teams, according to eyewitnesses, had gathered around the perimeter to enter in case arrest was needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the Police Department, said it was for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see the police and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that the car with the cameras on Church Street, along the west edge of the park, might have taken the picture.
When the police marched west through a pile of personal belongings of protesters, including bags, plastic mats, and plastic bags full of clothes, teams of the Department of Health followed her, gathering what had been abandoned.
Some protesters who refused to leave had been taken out, and photos of it soon appeared on the Internet.
A major group of protesters took positions near the camp's kitchen, at the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp chained themselves together by hand.
And two men chained themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The rescue services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clean-up operation was completed some 75 minutes later, and the police reported.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “infringing public order and resisting arrest”, he said.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department, was the most senior officer in the field.
Phil. T. Pulaski, the head of the D.A.P.D., was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “not led the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
A second group of policemen was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to get inside.
The fences were placed in Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw the police expand the perimeter from these positions even beyond the Zukotti Park.
At one point, the observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, crowding people further away.
About 28 men were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5:00 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, released air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The school service union will sue the city for dismissal
The union, representing the hundreds of school service staff who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that dismissals were not necessary and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor pupils are enrolled.
The trial is probably the last option available to the district council trade union 37, which is trying to cancel the dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, the contact point for work with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest-paying workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October, as a result of the fact that trade union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to health funds managed by labour groups to close the gap in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically rejected the charge.
At the City Council hearing last month, the chancellor of the Dennis M. Walcott Schools said that the dismissals were part of the budget that they signed in June.
One member of the board was paralysing, telling him that there was no indication in the budget that the support staff of the schools would be dismissed.
Representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had filed a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that a claim had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal claim to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The claim will refer to Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City and list eight workers who have been temporarily dismissed as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's law department, said that the city had not seen the suit and was therefore unable to comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the New York Times complaint, the union focused on a number of school dismissals in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He states that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island, and there were few in Upper East or Tribeca schools, 17 school auxiliaries lost their seats in County 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
While noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at a free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the claim states: “This is not the region of rich parents who can find money to make up for the budget failure”.
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way to count the extra funding for every poor student who went to school.
The trade union also claims that the school directors may have been misled by the language of the notice allowing the dismissal of the parent focal points.
The notification used the word “excess”, although “excession” is more commonly referred to when the school's teacher from the school's payroll is moved to the list of available employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been dismissed," states the draft claim, "not just translated."
Mission over, Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya.
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to accept something relevant to the insurrection in Libya.
All it took was for the mutiny to succeed, the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi was taken prisoner and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is to consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (democracy, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who lauds the Libyans for the successful uprising and the US troops for the “dust”.
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay homage to the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country,” said Kerry.
"This is confirmation of the support of both parties for their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has taken place easily.
This summer, legislators from both parties had been arguing with each other and with the White House about the language of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing limited use of the United States armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a significant majority of the two parties and was never put to the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would reduce the financing of the US operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in some sort of legislative purgatory - when Congress is annoyed enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not so angry that it can actually take the ground out of its feet.
Then events overcame Congress's hesitation.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels and, on 20 October, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “is to be admired by the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and perseverance in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to defend the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.
The resolution also “confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Affairs Council or split the legislature like the June Bill?
The last version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee.
Luger's representative said on Monday that he had not yet seen the last version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives is to vote this week for a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, a major legislative priority for almost every Republican and some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or to be submitted to the plenary vote of the Congress of that convocation.
Other legislators had not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary, but not because they had not tried.
The Gudlat amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that address a wide range of issues that have been introduced in this process.
Some duplicated - the same bill had been introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others had been minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget-balanced amendments in the House of Representatives alone and more about “control of federal expenditures”.
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors - mostly the newly elected Republican, who want to decorate their resumes - an opportunity to brag that they have “extended” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of members of the Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives, José Serrano (Democrat, New York), wants to lift the two term limit for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson, Jr. (democracy, Illinois) proposed many amendments to guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as has another one prohibiting the burning of a flag.
Some legislators also want to permit the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states object to them.
As members of the Congress have sought to propose amendments, they have moved as fast as they have been in the past.
In the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, while in the 110th Congress they made 66 such amendments.
This rate will be less than in the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Library of the Senate, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they've been as successful as they are now.
The last amendment, the 27th, was approved in 1992 but was actually submitted to Congress in 1789.
"Beated, but not defeated," says Giffords in his first TV interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man shot her in front of a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives, Gabriel Giffords (democracy party, Arizona), appeared on the federal channel on Monday night, sang a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Back Tomorrow" and said she wanted to get better than to return to Congress.
On the 20/20 program, ABC News with Diane Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty in formulating proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her the hard way to recover from the trauma of the bullet, which split the skull and shattered the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the draft law on the maximum debt.
In her first TV interview after the January shooting, in which six people had been killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang - and called her recovery "hard".
When Sawyer asked how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the special hour edition of the 20/20, which was shown on the eve of the new book by the couple, "Gabbie: A History of Courage and Hope".
A special episode spoke of the restoration of Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
In videos taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a razor head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists are teaching her how to do simple things.
Nod your head.
Spread out your lips.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word, "toast," to change the menu for breakfast.
The video shown by ABC shows that music has played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: we see the congressman sing along with the "Girls Just Want to Fun" doctors, Cindy Loper, and "Free Fall" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on the procedure, said she didn't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that he had read an article in the newspaper about the shooting on March 12, when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had been killed at the time.
The suspect, the assailant Jerd Lee Lafner, is being held in Missouri prison and is being subjected to forcible treatment pending trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Terrible, hard, hard."
One day, during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not defeated," said Kelly.
You're just beat up.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better, and you're gonna come back more than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a festival on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of helplessness, frustration, and loss.
At the signal, a number of hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines built around it.
The audience in the tuxedo applauded him standing up.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fund-raiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, which also had the then Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were treated like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted to do the right thing.
I know that.
But it was not really respect, it was pity.
The very contrasting impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have emerged between the army and the often apathetic, sometimes admired, American public.
The troops are overwhelmed by praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, say the military.
The public is acting more and more like they feel pity for people in uniform.
"We are not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who was in command of the forces in Iraq and is about to leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us like the poor."
It's a sensitive theme for warlords who don't want to look unthankful or dissenting to the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by returning troops in recent years of war in Viet Nam was far worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity take place quietly and between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting in the Marines, the retired colonel Mark Kenshn warned them that non-military men would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some people will look at them with admiration, because they have overwhelmed the rebels and been to exotic places.
Others will wonder whether “under the mask of a brutal, evil veteran,” said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and, upon his return, held a high government post in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some interviewers had been careful to ask him if he would be able to withstand the strain of responsible work in Washington, D.C., right after the combat.
Kenshn remembers when he said to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on a negative effect."
The inconvenience experienced by the military stems in part from American indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was most common in World War II,” says the retired Lt. General David Barnoux, who was in command of American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The troops are rated by the number of marches they have made, by the number of companions they have lost, or by the magnitude of the loss.
The army faces growing pressure from anti-rape supporters
This week, a historic court hearing should decide whether 28 men and women will be sued against the army for non-opposing rape.
If not, hundreds of applicants will be in line with the next one.
Private first-class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was allegedly raped by a coworker at night in her 11 weeks of pregnancy.
It was in October 2008, returning to her barracks at the Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend, and met a male coworker carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," Lyman says.
But the native of Texas had no fear.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I hadn't listened to my instinct."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, a man approached her from the back, fell and raped, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 current and former soldiers will have a hard time waiting for the trial to take place at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the suit that they have brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld, will be brought to trial.
The claim states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to deal with the widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
The suit, filed in February by counsel Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., originally included 17 applicants, but rose to 28 in the following months, to 25 women and three men, who all claim to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by fellow workers, and that the army failed to properly investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says that she's targeting the highest ranks of the army, because the problem starts with them.
"Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can exterminate the cult of violence?
Burke also says that, since February, some 400 other victims have been involved, many of whom may be involved in future claims.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case - put all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak - she'll open up a lot of stuff if you need to keep the pressure up.
The Department of Defence Defence Defence Team, under the direction of Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to close the case.
The court documents that Newsweek has received reveal the defence strategy, which is essentially that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army for damage to the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision, Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage is a risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs,” states the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on the story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially barred from participating in the fighting, this division exists only in word: modern wars rarely have a clear line of front.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, particularly in contact with local women in the war zone.
As a result, between the two wars, 150 women soldiers, two thirds of them in combat, lost their lives.
It's time for the army to become modern, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four major military academies on charges of promoting a feminist atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American War Veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a lawsuit against the army, the centre of which is the diagnosis of the “modification of the person” that victims of violence are given to remove them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the human rights group, the Organization for the Action of Women in the Armed Forces.
Her group sued the Veterans' Office in December, accusing him of discriminating with regard to applications for pensions from people who claimed to have been at risk of sexual violence during their service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures had been submitted to the Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 rape attempts were reported, according to the Ministry of Trafficking's Prevention and Control Service.
But, as is well known, attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure is about 13.5 per cent of the 19,000 alleged cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: 20 per cent of reported cases reached trial in 2010 - half as low as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case call the attacks on them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it had occurred.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of the rape on 11 separate occasions to the police, doctors and commanders.
She collected evidence of the rape, and the victim's blood, from a cut on her hand, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat in front of a judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend before the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive character to the accused, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was about to have a baby - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in the psych ward, and when I left, I remember my commanding officer said, "This was not a trial of him, it was a trial of me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her identity change, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed in an unfavourable manner, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case brought by Lyman and her suit mates will move forward is a complex issue, says John Turley, professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.
He notes, however, that “I believe they are in a position to move forward”.
There is a doctrine between them and the verdict that has been criticized since it emerged.
I've been criticizing Doctrine Feres my whole life.
The army has lagged behind for decades, because it has no incentives or restraints that impose responsibilities.
He adds: "The chance is very much against them ... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiff's counsel, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
The walls have eyes: how researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremists in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was a regular guy who spoke his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Bravik, who had confessed to the massacre in Norway in July, which had claimed the lives of 77 people, appeared at his first public trial.
Although Bravik could act alone, he was far from being single online: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, in contact with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups in social media.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy, you just have to go to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not hard to get close to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report on the European cyber populism of the British DEMOS Research Center.
Facebook's personal data is so big, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the website's advert to single out the required population group with scientific certainty - that marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans all over Europe and then tipped them off with ads, but instead of displaying a new group or a diet product, the ads offered the user a poll that included questions about the level of their education, the attitude to violence, and the optimism about their own future.
With Facebook's help, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 members of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries, not even leaving the office.
"This is a brand-new way to do research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not as amazing: online right-handers are most often male youths who are dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more intelligent, more democratic and less aggressive than those who are just hiding behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and polytologists use the site to study everything in the world, from health to social trends in the Laikas, wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding an average of three entries a day, Facebook's "super-actual information" has caused a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the name of the site in the headline by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook’s beauty is that it offers an opportunity to study people who cannot be reached on the street with a notebook.
"In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to join the party, and they'd never accept you," Bartlett says.
"Facebook excludes all of this - you address them directly."
Others say that this site could be used to identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who had discussed their drunken Facebook performances were at a much higher risk of alcoholism than students who had been quiet about it.
Moreno suggests that student peers, such as their hostel instructors, can monitor the site and interfere to help a student who too often updates his drinking status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and Director of the Centre for Children's Health, Behaviour and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We've found a way to identify children from a risk group that we wouldn't have found otherwise."
Facebook also regularly extracts various kinds of data about its users.
The website's data processing team processed the status statistics and Valentine's Day, the mid-term turnout in 2010 as well as the National Index of Happiness (mainly using information available to them - cyber-free champions long insisted that the site should make its vast collection of data publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site watches them, whether they like it or not, in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict standards for off-line research, online data is publicly available.
"I don't think a lot of users have at least thought that a researcher can watch their profile," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a study that he did in 2006 using a public Facebook student page.
"As far as they imagined, it was between them and their friends."
That raises the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that the subject of the study is very honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to find out how much information on the profile and on the user's page is correct.
"What you say on Facebook, and what you do outside Facebook, are two completely different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite years of work in the field of technology, Selvin thinks that the notebook and the pen are still the best research tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace a way out of the real world and with real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social research, and most social research is still offline."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Bering Bravik will be tried for the first time in public
Anders Bering Bravik, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that took the lives of 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a resistance fighter at the first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Knights of the Templars of Norway," he said to the 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I accept the actions, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torquil Nesheim interrupted Bravik during this monologue, because he "didn't want to give Bravik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravik, who had brought a written speech with him, to address the victims ' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Bravik in custody for another 12 weeks, denied him access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Bravik in the eye, others - to make sure it's under lockdown.
Everyone came to find the answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said NRK to the Norwegian channel, one of the survivors of Utoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally I was a little relieved after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Bravik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked in the eyes of the reporters and the survivors as he entered and left the building.
Despite Bravik's bizarre idea of being part of a big resistance movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy, and said that there was no evidence that he was dealing with his accomplices.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the 22 July attacks seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But it doesn't automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the whole nation is now experiencing.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but it's not," said the relative of one victim.
"It'd be a lot easier if it was."
Seven lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, which is shown at the theater this week.
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing a technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might consider to be the biggest discovery in the recent re-detected interview, which was recalled in the run-up to the major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and in production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a thorough organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders had suffered from "the pain of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the job ... [but] the great idea of a great product separates a huge amount of skill."
Let's go back to 1995, Bob Kringley created a TV series of Nerd Triumph on the arrival of a personal computer, and he spent over an hour with Jobs for a uniquely long conversation.
By that time, it had been about 10 years since Jobs had been kicked out of Apple, and he had been working at his new computer company, NeXT, in anticipation of the massive development of the Internet.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in the Nerds, he says that the original interviews went missing during the transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This film, a bit edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which is released at Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man who is known for his hating detailed interviews, Jobs seems unfamiliar here to express his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different moments in the interview, there's a big gap between questions and answers -- 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more accurate.
There are also moments where Jobs's perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems to be irritated by Kringley's questions, which make him move more quickly to questions or events of greater importance.
In the pre-Picsar era, iPods and iPhones of the Lost interview, there is something ominous prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about postmortem evaluations of Jobs' work, but there's something sensitive and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, a troubled dreamer on the verge of grandeur.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he said it all here, he went and did it.
A brief account of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"For all the time in the business, I've always asked, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers that you always get are, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I learned.
Jobs continues to detail his attempts to streamline the accounts in Apple.
A disillusioned way of recording the costs, which often began with “standard costs” that were taken from the ceiling and then followed up with a “unique”, he created an automated structure that ensured that they would be able to track the business outlays up to the details.
About the pope joke:
Jobs details the "blue box" he made with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to hack the phone company effectively and call for free long distances.
There's been a lot of writing about the device before, but Jobs' euphoria here, describing the blue box as an act of power is contagious.
He talks about how he and Wozniak were testing the box using a computer phone, ordering a conversation, and then connecting from one AT&T network to the next, until they linked as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the globe half a dozen times, and you've been yelling at the machine phone, and it's been coming in a minute later on to the next phone," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure all over the world."
We both knew a little bit, but we could build a little thing that could control a big thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, Apple could ever show up.
Jobs continues to describe in detail a famous incident that he and Wozniak almost managed by calling the Vatican via a blue box at midnight and by calling the Pope, trying hard to copy Henry Kissinger.
When the different members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two laughter exploded just before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About the love of technology (and the cold name Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, he was looking for spare parts to collect the frequencies, and he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer job in Hewlett Packard.
"It had a strong impact on me, "it was the only company I had ever seen at that age, "and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw the "best desktop computer".
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a small monitor with an electronic ray tube, and I fell in love with it.
I used to go to HP when I was a teenager and go around that car and write programs for it.
On improvised innovation:
In a number of places, Jobs talks about the invention of new products for the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of installments, a buyer asked him to collect a complete computer.
While working on a loan for 30 days, he had to consider both the assembly and the delivery of ready-made devices.
Later in Apple, he remembers the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the raging argument... "they yelled at me that it would take me five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], "and I was fed up, "and I went out, "and I found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About the big companies that are losing power:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs foresaw exactly how many industry leaders would misunderstand the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company's not getting any more successful.
Sale and marketing make it more successful, so [these types of people] who end up running companies, and the people who make the product are being pushed off the decision-making site.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is replaced by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times the size, could be the Microsoft of the '90s...
They've been defeated by victory.
On innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea from the great product separates a huge number of skillful work ... when you twist the great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her finesse.
There are compromises that you need to make -- some of the things you can't make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head - these concepts - connecting them all together...
In the end, it's all about taste - it's all about trying to express yourself to the best that humans have ever made, and later to try to bring it into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made MacIntosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had become the best information technology experts in the world.
If it weren't for information technology, they'd do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having lunch with the opponents of the health law while the court is considering the case.
On the day the Supreme Court was meeting behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether he would hear President Obama's health law, his two judges, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas, be heard at a luncheon sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the High Court.
This case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions that had been filed.
One of the cases on the agenda was a motion supported by 26 states challenging the rapid revision of health by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists from all over the nation.
The judges had agreed to consider the process; indeed, a 5 1/2-hour turn-out was expected in March 2012 and the outcome was likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which would be in the middle of the day the judgement was announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the health law must be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was the Deputy Attorney General during George W. Bush's presidency.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped to sponsor the annual lunch of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that has consistently defended conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Independent Business Federation.
Another sponsor was Pflizer Inc, a pharmaceutical giant, who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel hours after the trial.
There was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, a leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the Health Care Act.
Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
This is not in conflict with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which governs the lower federal judges.
If they did, they might be subject to the principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judge may attend the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honorary guest, or be mentioned in the programme of such an event”.
Nevertheless, the apparent closeness of Scalia and Thomas to the two law firms in this case, as with the company with a big financial interest, was a sufficient signal to the ethics activists in the government.
“This is a staggering breach of ethics and apathy to the code is contrary to the statements made by some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of General Affairs.
"The judges have been drinking and dining at an official fund-raiser with the lawyers who are currently in court."
Their presence and assistance in the collection of money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with case groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue for Judge Helena Kagan, not for Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the court of the first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case, because she was too involved in the defence of the law to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show that she was going to do it.
Boeing gets a record 18-billion-dollar flight order.
Emirates is ordering 50 wide-body Boeing 777 and may be ordering another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal is over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company gets an order for 50 pieces of its product.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. jet, and the price for all of these 50 planes is $18 billion.
Just as important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing gold mine of future plane orders.
In a Monday forecast, the Chicago Company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend his biggest dollar-equivalent order for commercial planes, 50 two-way Boeing 777.
An incredible order was made by Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy 20 more planes, which will raise the total price to 26 billion dollars, and Boeing said on the airshow of Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which can show a much better economy of fuel and passenger comfort.
The price of six fixed-wing aircraft will be more than $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said Morningstar Analyst Neil Dior.
"The quality of these specific customers is quite high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but also the increase in the price of fuel, which usually harms airlines, as it is one of the largest items of expenditure, is not so fatal, because the country is making money at high oil prices.
That's important, because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the plane order when the prices go up, Diora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the wide-flying-aircraft market and helps prevent the rival Airbus SAS from invading its dominance with its A350 flight.
Boeing won the air show four months later, after Airbus announced that he would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competed with 777-300ER.
He postponed his debut to increase the axe load after the buyers demanded an increase in the volume and range of the flight.
Boeing Co shares rose by 1.5 percent to $6,94.
The sister of the president of Mexico evidently lost in the Michoacán election.
Louisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealers helped the opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRI in the run.
President Felipe Calderon's sister did not seem to have fulfilled her application for the position of Governor Michoacán during the brutal state elections, and she said on Monday that drug dealers had helped to induce a race in favor of one of her opponents.
Initially, the leader in the race for the seat of the governor of the Western state is called Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the IRI.
“The intervention of organized crime during the entire electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but also for the whole country,” said Louise Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after the Sunday poll.
"They bullied our candidates, our employees at the election... "they grabbed the ballot box, put obstacles... "and forced people to vote for the IRI.
The IRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She's planning her return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The IRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have just overtaken Calderon, who led the ratings until election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the National Action Party, or a PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Sylvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DDP, which now owns the governor's seat, came third, a major defeat for the divided and failed left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state of Morelia, denied links to drug traffickers and called on other candidates to accept the results.
In Michoacán, drug cartels, specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine, have long dominated the world.
This is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still continuing.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the election, when he was agitating for Louise Maria Calderon, and a number of candidates left the local race out of fear.
For the IRI, however horrifying the Michokan elections may look, the victory will give the party an impulse.
The man who is to represent the IRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the run-up to next year."
ADB is persuading Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has made India and China ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the manager of the ADB office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing big economies must “do what they can” to speed up the recovery of the currency bloc by either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties “impartially” and said that Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help to avoid a long-term recession in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowed funds have grown alarmingly, and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The European debt crisis has raised fears that it can lead the world economy back to recession, and has led to calls by leading developing economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be provided through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial aid bonds, the means to secure financial stability in Europe -- was a huge bargaining power for Europe ' s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, the Minister of Trade of India, said that “India will do all it can to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have huge challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find a job for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others argue that there is no point for developing economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Astouche Varshny, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult politically to help Europe with 1.2 billion Indians, of whom some 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point, they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and go to the sea for holidays, and it won't be well received," he said.
Lee Howell, the Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greek large and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, cost-effective enterprises, such as railroads.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis was threatening “significant direct consequences” throughout Asia.
ADB's forecast of a 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now faced with “promising risks” due to a threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to make “emergency plans” to protect themselves from the recession and significant outflows of capital from their economies.
The Pentagon ' s fearful warnings of potential reductions in defence spending
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, set the stage on Monday at the Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to a $450 billion cut in the coming decade, but it is now afraid that an additional $600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress is not able to reach a cost agreement.
“The consequences of these cuts will be devastating to the Ministry,” Panetta reported in a letter to the senators of the Republican John McKain, Arizona, and to the Republican Lyndsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the Congress's failure to accept the budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestre is triggering a general cut of 23 per cent and the end of many new projects.
“This severe reduction, which has been so thoughtlessly applied, will make most of our ship-building and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building -- and will cause serious damage to other attempts at modernization,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We're also going to have to fire a lot of our civilian employees, and since the cut is going to be made so fast, we're almost sure we're going to have to fire a civilian to reach the target."
"These changes will erode the trust of those who support our army and cause serious harm to our readiness."
The abbreviations will eventually affect the military, Panetta said.
“Although military financing in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequestre, military developments will be seriously affected by a major disruption in the core budget,” Panetta warned.
“Contracted personnel will be shortened, which will result in the cancellation of contracts and the oversight contract that supports the troops.”
“Anyone will be shortened, resulting in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote to the Panetta 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
"The effect of the sequestration in the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand firm against this draconian action," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday night, when they released the Panetta letter.
"This is not the way we can live with, and this is not the way we have to impose ourselves."
“The Sequestre is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether the Panetta's letter or the latest senators' warnings lead to a budget compromise, or the calls for the release of the Pentagon from cutbacks, we'll see later.
The Panetta was completely sincere about possible cuts, although he came to work in the Pentagon's management after many years of budget reviews in Congress and the White House, and was aware that he was facing a difficult choice.
At last week's press conference, the Minister of Defence painted a depressing picture of what might follow -- troops with a shell but no nucleus.
"This is a ship without sailors."
"This is a squad with no bullets."
"This is the wing of the plane without enough pilots."
"This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings, and bombs without enough trained soldiers to perform the mission," said Panetta in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from an unstable spirit of war, a bad will and a failure to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he described new details of how reductions “create significant operational risks: slowing the response to crises, conflicts and catastrophes; seriously limiting our ability to be the first to deploy and respond anywhere in the world; and leading to unacceptable risk in future combat operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects may face obstacles, including those that have passed the tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 striker, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the Army and the Marines need to replace with a hummer.
Ending the further development and testing of F35 may save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and confront the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Catch on a Liar
A quick look at the last headlines shows how serious and widespread deceit and lies are in daily life.
A Republican presidential candidate, Herman Kane, is in the process of challenging charges of sexual harassment by a number of women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania was charged with perjury because they allegedly concealed that a retired football coach had raped the boys.
Last week, French president Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on a microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet-exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself, denying his actions, which was quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
John Edwards, a former president's candidate, was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to conceal extramarital relationships.
Again, none of those who lived at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was found lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
Stories of fraud at school and college exams are common.
There were times when teachers gave the students answers to the tests in order to have a good self-assessment of the results of their work.
Teachers who have to teach the contrary send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In one day, studies show that you can be lied to 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to save.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of dating each other.
Identifying a lie or perpetrating a lie is a skill that everyone needs for both personal and professional purposes.
In contrast to a room game that looks like, say, charades, where you need to exclaim "Finded!", the identification of lies is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that are involved in comprehensive research projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most old myths about lies have been dispelled.
Liars look in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stutter, blush, or fuss.
Do not conclude that liars are hard to spot and hard to expose.
An experienced incriminator of lies can come to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the mimics, the structure of the questions, and the temporal characteristics.
I have spent a number of years exploring scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of the knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the identification of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps to guide in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are very good at reading others, making them feel free to manage their own emotions and intuitively the way others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people lie less to their partners than to the singles (but the lies they say are most often obstinate).
We also know that if you are perceived as a fraud, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do you know if anyone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
It's called the definition of the initial state.
This helps to provide a starting point for the assessment of change further.
Observe the image, the laughter, the voice properties of your object.
It's good to know if a person knocks his feet all the time in normal condition, then you won't make an unfair charge when you see his feet knocking in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for a group of deceptive verbal and non-verbal acts.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as proof of fraud.
Deceivers can fix the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet in the direction of the door, bend to the exit, change their position in a certain way, or show "lightening after the interview" -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change of posture when all the complex issues are over.
Investigators often falsify an end-of-interview signal to just look at this relief after the interview.
So, look at the speech of your object.
Scott Peterson is known to have stumbled and used the past time to claim that his murdered wife was alive, leading to her search throughout the country.
Attractive people can also use remoteness in speech: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman ... Miss Levinski" or to repeat the complex question completely.
The most common note-indicators are barely detectable.
Someone can use a "qualification language" to answer a complex question, "All right ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... as far as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There's no magical way to detect a lie, but you can learn how to detect a fraud.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not becoming the victim of skilled cons in professional and private life.
Controversial plan for the oil pipeline needs to be reviewed after the US threat to delay its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- arousing the anger of trade unions, but calming the environmentalists -- the company that is about to construct the pipeline claims that it is willing to review the project in order to resume work on it.
TransCanada announced on Monday night that it would remove the planned oil pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sand Hills in Nebraska and that the project would still be approved.
The company made this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska State Capitol.
The official representative of TransCanada, Alex Purbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive approval for the oil pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This follows a statement by the State Department last week that it will defer a decision on a federal project until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills and the Ogalala Aquifer, a huge underground water reserve.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new eco-analysis ordered by the Department of State is likely to push the decision back to 2013, after the next year's elections, although the authorities denied that the decision was a political one.
Obama, in a written statement last week, called the Department of State for the decision, and expressed his support for it.
The oil pipeline, which is 1,700 miles long, should extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He's supposed to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to the Texas refinery.
To do that, he needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but he likes trade unions that hope for some 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska’s opponents are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand Hills and the Ogallala Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department study on the impact on the environment showed that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source in the energy industry stated that the Department's auditor had ordered a separate examination of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Eliott, who was an adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other was whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate, because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle was sued for allegedly making the baby sick out of fear.
The New York family claims that the disco-deaf Patti LaBell started raging in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scaring their little daughter to the point that it was vomiting out of fear.
Tyrade "Lady Marmalade" terrorized 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so badly that she suffered "manual change, sleep disorders" and "severe fear of strangers," says her family in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on November 10, last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said that she stopped by the door and let her daughter down for a minute.
"Someone came to me from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said yes, and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell reprimanded a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got furious and began to use swearing -- the word for C and the word for F -- in high tone ...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of a bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "look at what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the baby.
LaBell attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her chaperone had to hold her and push her in the waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The baby cried so hard, she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note to LaBell demanding an apology, but did not receive a response.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBell are not answering the calls for comment.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not reported, but the family counsel, Sam Davis, said that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family planned to donate any money that he received to charity to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBell answer for what he did," said Davis.
“This conduct is absolutely unacceptable, especially with regard to the caregiver of the kindergarten with an 18-month-old child in his arms.”
Climate issues slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López's reign in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market rose, foreign financing declined, and the economy was weakened.
2011 is the year that will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as linked to the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, also called the Year of Change, which has raised high hopes for economic development, but, given the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but there has been a decline in basic economic development.
The low temperatures of February not only lost millions in the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth potential of the public economy, leading to a total decline of 3.6 per cent in economic activity in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historic drop of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the performance of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on the areas affected by the frost, provided by the Council for Sustainable Rural Development of Mexico, 835,582 hectares have been affected, of which 78.03 per cent have been entirely affected, while the remaining 21,07 per cent have been partially affected, with the main damaged crops being vegetables, maize and mute.
The decline in economic activity led, until November, to a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, in the first three quarters, to an accelerated increase in the rate of unemployment, from January to March 55,053 Sinaloa had been unemployed, with a share of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, in the second quarter to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September it had continued to grow to 6.19 per cent, a proportion of more than 74,000 Sinloa unemployed people, an increase of 18.969 in comparison with the first half.
Reduced liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa over the course of the year has been addressed by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, the Director of the Department of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions taken in public policy.
“What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to a number of factors, including the loss of market liquidity to limit the resources imposed by the law adopted by Congress to combat money-laundering, since it is not easy for people who illegally own dollars to work with them, invest and use them in something,” he said.
Stopped immigration
López Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad has been limited in the US, primarily because of the difficulty of entry, and in the second, because once they have entered, they are already facing very many difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, as a result of which the unemployment rate is rising," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is getting worse if you consider the high incidence of labour-related disorders, according to INEGI, that 60,38 per cent of the active population of the state works without being mentioned as employees in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregularity, another reminder of the state ' s work is presented by low wages; in the State, the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was up to September 5,352 pesos, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
FDI reduction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high rate of unemployment, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630,697 from January to July. This represents a decline of 87.74 per cent, compared to $5,143,312 over the same period last year.
For its part, the State Government's Ministry of Economic Development recorded only 17,280,000 peso-investment during the year, which was largely the product of service companies.
Duty
Against the background of the economic downturn, the state government in July requested the approval of a 3-billion-peso loan to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, at the local level, only 2,600 million pesos had been approved, and until November there had been no debt advantage in any sector of the state economy.
Responses
For business representatives, Mario López Valdez's first year of government shows a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that in 2011 there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of different sectors, including the state government itself.
“The efficiency of the Sinaloa economy has been really low this year, has to work hard to get back the positions lost this year, we have to redouble our efforts in 2012, we have failed to agree on the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better,” he said.
The slowing down of the economy
López Loredo said that events like the early freezes this year stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“The low levels of the economy are the result of a number of events, including the frost, and one of the main effects was the slow economy, which is not getting fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations,” he said.
Revision of the heading
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic production activity.
“In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that there is a need to develop a long-term programme that will rethink the direction and economic course of the state, and to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better guide the Government's efforts.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various fields, and there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,” he said.
He noted that the current administration had shown progress in its own way of public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that much more needs to be done," he said.
He's sentenced for 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days in revenue - a sentence imposed on a national of Navolato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney-General reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, had been convicted of a crime against health, in that case possession of marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
In the case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during patrolling Cypruso Valdez Street, in front of Post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pick-up truck, carrying a black bag in a box in a car, and on the passenger seat a small backpack, where the soldiers found eight kilograms of marijuana and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was placed at the disposal of the Second District Court, and the accused continues to be incarcerated at the Centre for the Legal Consequences of Crime.
We need to make contributions to the work
Public works related to programmes such as the Homeland, the Salvation of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of being unfinished or put on hold for a long time, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that, while the work programmes had been developed so far, they were in danger, as the State Government was not in a position to make the relevant contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes was about 50 million pesos, of which the State was expected to contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, and it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny when they had to give us a part since the beginning of July," he said, "to keep up, we've started work and they've made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions that it was expected to make, so at the beginning of the term of the municipality it had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that had not been made available in the case of the administration of the State.
"This happened to us in the previous administration, because the state had no financial means to participate, and the programs continued to develop, and this year to access these programs, we need to find the resources to cover what the state has left," he explained.
While the state authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that the interest involved would arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to pay almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny."
The court will approve the “transition to digital television” in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogues to digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (JC) rejected the constitutional motions made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which moved the so-called “transition to digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes had not been obtained to annul it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing the steps taken to move to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate had been rejected because of the absence of a qualified majority of the eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remained in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right established by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Marguerite Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this point, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to disprove the decree and support the complaints, and Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to in the decree regarding the move to digital broadcasting.
It was also decided at the Ministerial Meeting to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the argument of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot determine the general rules for the measures to be prepared by the public administration.
“I also do not believe that this would have affected the autonomy of the regulator” and recalled that planning public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the administration of the State.
Replacing analogues to digital signals, one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years, has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better quality of the signal, and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of transforming into a digital form, which includes meeting public needs, which have more than a technical dimension, “because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These questions, he said, “requests the work of a whole system of public economic governance, including a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into the State executive branch”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and had done so with the help of the executive, despite the existence of highly specialized technical institutions.
From this it cannot be concluded that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any event affects the competence of the Congress, has said that the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly shall be enforced in the administrative sphere.
In Michoacana, the possibility of counting "vote-by-vote" is being analysed.
According to the data submitted to the PRRA, the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor ' s elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of counting a “vote-for-vote” is real with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where, according to the Provisional Results Programme (PPP), the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting 879 of the total of 6.074 protocols.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Michokan Electoral Institute (IMI), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Saragos, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the Electoral Corps had adopted a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law Act, as the State Congress approved the reforms just before the legal deadline for their entry into force in the electoral process, and the Governor, Leonel Godoy Rangel, did not include its publication in the time frame set out in the Act in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJJ) ruled on a constitutional claim made by the local legislature and called the state's representative's vote on constitutional reform “unvalid and illegal” because it had no right to “permit or support it”.
In an interview on the possibility of a “vote-for-vote” Maria de los Angeles Landerall claimed that, with the adoption of suitable principles by the General Council of IWM, it would be possible to present a partial or complete count of the votes by the local electoral body.
For example, a partial recalculation of one or more ballot boxes can be made on the condition that: the results of the records are not consistent; there is no record of the voting and the counting of the documents in the urn or it is not in the hands of the chairman; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, a total recalculation of the votes in all the urns in the elections may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged winner of the elections in question and the second-place candidate is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the party and/or coalition representative who put out the second of the candidates in question.
A total recount will also be made if, at the end of the normal count, it is determined that the difference between the winner and the second-place candidate is less than or equal to 1 per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party, whose candidate is second-placed, in the event that the ballot boxes, which have been taken into account in the partial recalculation, are excluded.
It is worth noting that this is the case in Morellia, where, according to the PDRP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even if the number of votes is 129 out of a total of 923 protocols.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the hills of the Sapalinam, confirming it to his family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortez arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; on Monday, an inspection and a resting Mass was conducted.
According to the family, the last will of the Lt. Col. was to scatter his ashes in the Sapalinam Mountains.
After accepting condolence with others who died in the crash, the Basio Cortez family returned to the capital, Coawila, on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft, and the closest people attended a ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on the Nazario Boulevard Ortiz Garcia, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 this afternoon, he was examined by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during high school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and that his ashes should be scattered in the Sapalinama Mountains, he always said it to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortés Basio, the pilot's sister.
In her view, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, and she believes that he was at the top of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son, and a loving brother, loyal to his family."
Felipe Cortés Basio, a very young man, left Saltillo to join the Aeronautical College in Sapopana, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he was dizzy even in the truck, but he always wanted to live up to his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he got to Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him, like when he brought Martha Sagan to Saltillo."
He remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan to attend his relative's diplomas, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in his life: driving a plane.
He's being led to the last resort.
Shots were fired in honour of Lieutenant-Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortez Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopez, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo School of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and made progress in both his studies and his sports.
Basio Cortez recently died when the helicopter he was driving crashed, along with the Secretary of the Provincial Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all the representatives of the Ministry.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Basio Cortes (created), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over by the funeral office to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major James Martinez, to the Esplanade of the training school, where his family was already waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Christina, her mother, her brothers and other relatives, his students and his teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned at the NL Caderate Farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities had shown to the media 11 persons who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereita Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was found on a 1.5-km Cadereita road to Santiago, on a hill in a commune known as El Castillo.
A number of people who passed by noticed that the gate was open in the village house, the wall of which was painted in beige and brown.
When they looked inside, just three meters away, they found the bodies of three men, and they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and another man in a white shirt was next to him.
Almost one metre was the body of another person, wearing a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people had been killed elsewhere because there were no shell casings on the scene.
On the fence of the village house there are signs addressed to one organized criminal group by another, and there are several bullet holes in the gate.
11 caught in Cadet
The Ministry of National Security has represented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that was mainly active in the municipality of Cadereita and who are charged with abduction, murder, “fraud” and secret graves.
According to published information, eight people were initially detained in the Los Alvero colony on 11 November, while one person who had been held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a phone, demanding that they become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event took place on November 12, at 06:00 a.m., military personnel rounded the village of Old Rancho in Cadereita, when they saw a car with no license plate with two men in the salon.
After stopping them and inspecting them, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, on 13 November, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was stopped in the public land of La Truth, who, when he saw the military, was trying to escape.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Caderate.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to present a new government that will face the crisis that put this country on the verge of an economic catastrophe.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the Italian president on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the edge of an economic catastrophe and has damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a mainly technocratial cabinet, although it is not clear when the new executive body will take up its positions.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in the country's ability to get out of this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner to reporters.
Monty did not explicitly say that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The article is now well-designed," he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy was struggling with the political and financial crisis, which brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration, under the leadership of the former European Commissioner Monty, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monty to rush it, the unstable markets have set up a 10-year profit from the BTP bonds of Italy over 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told the reporters after the meeting with Monty, "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this government is Italy's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the Sylvio Berlusconi LDP party, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said Angelino Alphano, the secretary of the centralist-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important, because so far many of its members have resisted the government majority of technocrats that form Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty government must have strong parliamentary support for reform, which is likely to be unpopular reforms of austerity.
Any blocking or halting of these attempts can lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has increased pressure, warning that Monty's failure can be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations, on Monday.
He'll finish a series of his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, who resolved a very fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would be retiring, the cost of Italy’s debt had now reached a critical level, given the uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Salvaging Italy with a public debt of Euro1.8 billion would be too much for modern euro-zone financiers.
Monty said that his government would be in place until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to reform before he could appoint a new election.
Monty said he'd like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that it should be composed of technical experts only, a sign of their dissatisfaction with the fact that the financial situation is affecting the process.
Political sources reported that the mutual distrust and dissent of the parties made it more difficult to try to include political figures.
The Spaniards have more game experience than the Ticos.
Of the 22 players announced in Spain, 10 had already played 50 international games.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 games.
A small contrast with Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 players who had been summoned by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and Europe champions, number one in FIFA's monthly ratings, have a whole list of class A selection games, Tricolor has only a defender of Michael Ouman as the only one who has performed 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
The Spanish footballers, who play in the League of All Stars and in the strong clubs of the Prime League of England, have been very active in the leagues and local Cups this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
It is worth adding to this the experience of the Spanish Fury in complex qualifications in the Euro or the World Cup.
The players, however, have limited international experience in an area like CONCAQAF, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he is the head of the list in the Spanish Hollywood team, Icker Kasillas, who last Sunday, against England (the one lost 0-1 in London) echoed the record of the Andoni Subisarreta ex-golicer, with 126 international matches.
Kasillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, a player in Barcelona, has 106 games.
Kasillas and Javi were considered the best last week by UEFA, together with another player in the Iberian team, Subisarret, with 126 matches and a bombarder, Shalke Raul Gonzalez, with 102.
It's close to 100 Carles Puilles with 97 games.
Javi Alonso has followed them since 91, Fernando Torres from 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both from 81, Andres Inesta from 62, Sesk Fabregas from 61, and David Silva from 53.
Costa Rica next to Michael Umana, left side-handed Junior Diaz with 48 matches, and bombarder Brian Ruiz with 45.
Next, only five have crossed the 30 games: Caylor Navas from 31, Randall Asoffeif from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Hernández from 36, and José Luis Lopez from 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain for Gerard Piquet (37), Sergio Bousquetsa (36), Santiago Santi Kasorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiola (31).
There's Roy Miller with 26 games, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25, and Roy Murey with 23.
The rest didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Morreal has only four games, and Hordi Alba has two games, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
The leading player in Spain, David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres since 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz became the one who had more points, twice as high as Carlos Hernandez and three times as high as Roy Murry and Parks.
Quintette put the country on a 20-year career tour.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true."
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, the band was ready to give one of the best concerts the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It's been over 20 years of waiting, but the group says it's also a dream that's become a reality for them to play in this country.
This was a statement by the bass player and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is based in South America as part of a 20-year tour and on Sunday, the 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with a team from Los Angeles, The X, and a local band, Las Robertas.
This is a passage from a conversation that is fully decrypted online on The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica, is it a dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is just our second visit to South and Central America, and so far it's going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once - on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're very happy to bring our music.
I'm asking because there is some loyalty to the group; fans live in stress the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat him like the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest show we've played in the past 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in São Paulo, and we hope that this has led us to form for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungles, with regard to these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surfwaves?
We have a lot of surfing friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, it's a great place for surfing, and that's how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
When you look at the tour, you can say that you've made a grand show with a lot of songs.
What are you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no limits on what we can do.
We'll try to make the best show possible with a wide range of songs; we'll try to play a couple of songs from each album and present to our fans a wide variety of repertoires.
You never repeat a repertoire.
How do you do that?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in a tone and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us, and so I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This tour marks 20 years of your career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us ever imagined that we would be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We enjoy our luck, and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
It all works out very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the bloom of the gronze?
It's always been an honor to be part of this group of great teams.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney, and Alice in Chains.
It's cool when a movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, a group from the same city emerges, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We're proud and it's an honor to be a part of a band from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them, and it's an honor to be a part of the sound of Seattle that came out.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same unit for so long.
Yeah, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a lot longer than there are many groups.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and secondly, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, we have also opened up musical roads that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't have been better.
Your view of the word was not easy; but thanks to your success, you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find the balance?
When we grew up, it was easier to find a balance.
We care not to be on tour too long, because it's easy to get into this game by the big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what made it, not to be a celebrity or a rock star, that none of us really care about.
What do you remember your other project, "Manother Love Bone"?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at the start it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years, and we haven't released any albums until Andy's death.
There was a lot of disappointment, because it lasted so long, and most importantly, we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a picture, I think of the incredible man Andy was, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football, and a lot of things.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yeah, the producers sent us some video offers, and it was a band that we liked most, so we can't wait to see what Las Roberttas can offer live, and it must be very exciting.
Why do you always change the word at Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question to Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's using the first thing that comes up to him.
Who has influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Geather Butler, John Antwhistle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassians I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunge relevant, even though it is no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling a bit of a break from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all of those that came out at the same time, and if it's important right now, I think it's wonderful, because it's the music that's worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music better than ever.
At first, your music was more grim, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are a couple of songs on the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or the Just Breathe that are considered very gloomy, even though they may sound a little positive.
From both of them, when Ed was playing them, I cried when I listened to them, those songs are very grim.
I think that when you're growing up and there's been some kind of trauma in your life and you've lost a member of a family or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make a dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for a medical examination.
Ex-president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the public hospital, and his family doctor told him to test for the loss of muscle in his legs.
Fujimori, aged 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from a number of diseases, including language cancer, which has led to his operation four times and being monitored.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his private doctor, told TV channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of power in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that in his view Fujimori should be a candidate for the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He had undergone four tests on language cancer, lost 18 kilograms of weight, to which other diseases, such as a strong erosion gastrit, pancreas cysts, kidney rocks, high blood pressure, and blood flow problems in his legs, were listed by the doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Department of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the army's extermination force, which operated secretly during the first years of his reign.
Mujika is going to Mexico to fortify political ties
An official delegation led by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will come to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Mujika will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important point in the vast plan of meetings with the political, commercial and community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to a timetable published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will be “favourable for the exchange of information on political relations between the two nations,” as the South American leadership has published on its website.
According to the local media, Mujica is seeking support for the Calderon for Uruguay in an incident with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy listed the South American country as a tax haven at a G20 meeting in the French city of Canne.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remained tax havens a statement that had provoked a protest by Uruguay and a withdrawal for consultations by his Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the most developed and developing countries, and in fact has had an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements in order to leave the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's grey list, drawn up from countries that do not enjoy international standards of tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay had had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which had increased trade between the two countries.
A mustard plumber will be 3D with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's evil paws, but he's never done it in three dimensions before: at Super Mario 3D Land, he's gonna fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will be available in stores around the world this month, is based on the properties of the Nintendo 3DS Portable Console, which can play in three dimensions without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell us how stereoscopes will work without scores," said Nintendo, head of the press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially designed for this platform", because until now successful products like Star Fox 64 3D or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adapting to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that, despite the existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "accessible" video game that enjoyed a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
One day, most experts will go "second round" to the levels of the game, which are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D Aggressive" or the one that only affects the depth of the action, but that needs to be played in three dimensions in order to overcome a wide range of obstacles and "do not succumb to optical illusions."
This three-dimensional Super Mario invasion also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the show and repeats the successful formula from the previous games, a plumber with a mustache has to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will find new movements, decorations, suits and enemies, as well as the Luigi's "player".
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo had begun to hold him accountable in the United States for a plot to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to a request from the northern country, which requested the extradition of Portillo to be tried there.
At a press conference, Kolom said that his decision related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he had not “handed hands” to legal decisions and had accepted all the extradition procedures he had ever known of.
Together with Portillo Sergio Roano Marroquin, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug sales.
What Kolom has done shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted with a view to prosecuting the ex-heads of the State from 2000 to 2004.
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CPC), Portillo will be extradited once, with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of the waste of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a pre-removal process, but the Ministry of Public Relations filed an appeal and reopened the case.
Trijove helped 6,000 at-risk young people
The organization was set up to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Trijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people who are prone to social exclusion have helped to overcome complex situations over this quarter of a century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for a ceremony held in the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijov was born next to the Villa Trinitat in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, a lack of work and drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's Sant Andreu celebration brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that had been working with the association during the past 25 years.
The different political representation during the elections revealed the uniform nature of the work done by Trijove.
Following the President of the Generality, Arthur Mass, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, an ex-consultator of the Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and an ex-leutenant of the Mayor and the current eco-socialist, Ricarard Gom, a member of the municipal council, attended the ceremony.
The current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, Josep Lewis Cleris, and the SEA for Social Work, La Caixa, House Lanapa, also appeared in Fabra I Coats.
He said that Trinijov had come to life in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work that had been done so far "is a good base."
The Chairman cited Trinijov as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and the instilling of hope in people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not new to the organization and the work done to her," he said.
Captured building, where mass parties were organized, evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without a fight.
It seems that the nightmare of the neighbors who live in the 51st Street of Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building yesterday at noon, which they illegally occupied, and where they organized mass parties that irritated the neighbors, by a court order, without the intervention of the police.
When the operation was over, the door lock was changed to prevent a relapse.
"As of this moment, there will be a pass check," the manager said.
The squatters, who took 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of the building was inhabited, took all the electricity and water, painted the walls, and left traces of various kinds, particularly of alcohol cans.
The first three floors were a mass party site, which lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
There is a nightclub right behind the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her income had declined by 80 per cent since the building was occupied.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the building got her into an unfair competition, because they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for ten.
In addition, the discotheque owner was to respond to the noise complaints of the neighbors, although she observed that the noise was caused not by the club's visitors, but by the people of the squat, and above all by those who attended the parties that had organized there, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said that the inconvenience was so big that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months, he had “forgave” her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks more complaints had been received from the neighbours about the situation.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, Alberto Fernand Díaz, demanded last week “to evacuate the building immediately to address the problems of coexistence and shared spirit of the neighbours and degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that, until summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the last few months the squatters had invaded all the floors and almost every room, and that some had been hacked.
In this sense, he added that “there is a need to put an end to impunity and to resist the culture of the building.”
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building in Noo Barris.
At 3:30, the police left for Montral Street, 35, after getting a call from a neighbor who noticed four men entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a contest after the contrition of contributions
The 16-door municipal competition reopened the debate on the role of Colcerola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the rise of the now-dead Barcelona Capital Corporation (BCC), this administration was printing posters for Kolserola.
The Booklet described the mountain as a big park in Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in images with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the SSC, in 1987 the park re-emerged in the minds of many as the highest point in Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few, which is focused not on the north-south but on the up (mount) - down (the sea).
The positioning of Colcerola as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar in the role of Yogi Bear.
That was until, in September, the council announced a huge competition, consisting of 16 competitions for a lot of other gates to Kolserola.
The gate means the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gates on the field.
The question is, Colserola, a park or a mountain?
Competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a subject for discussion by all architects of Barcelona.
It's almost the most repetitive thing to discuss when the two members of this chosen clan recognize each other in the elevator.
And that fact leads to one of the few overlaps between what the three architects of Barcelona say and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: The competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes “necessary” to discuss the “front side of the mountain” when the offer of Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"We have to assume that the biggest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, it's beautifully accessible.
Colserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Collserola gate" contains a "word trap": we should not think of them "as the entrance to the park, but as limiting some of the areas where we must act."
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona, with experience in urban construction, called the proposal a “intellectual task” with “some dangers”.
Risks arising from the “uncertainty of the prediction of public space” after the experience of the 1980s, which ended at the Forum site of “his swan song”.
The first fear is the very limiting of the boundaries that can be built.
"Restriction of something is the preparation of the next step," means the transition.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because current [in the case of the Capital Master Plan (GSP)] can lead to real trouble."
Closer to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Kolserola Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, rather than" as a purely topographic question.
Modolo remembers that there is already work done outside of Calcerola, which is "not to miss past his ears," although he is grateful for the opportunity that the City Hall offers to join the project "from the start."
And what is more, he realizes that the proximity of a mountain to a city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "he questions" whether this technical profile is something that should lead interdisciplinary teams ("success," he claims), which should have created: "The architects should be only an instrument."
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that asks the name of this part is complex, because the rules of the competition do not contain the general form of Colserola: "Sixteen intersecting competitions have been announced,," he says, "in the sense of the sea-mounted, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
At least in his case, this leads to 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for one gate can overlap with a program and a definition of an architect for the next gate.
From your point of view, the council must guarantee that the strip directly above Rhonda de Dalta should provide, in its completeness, an area equipped to create a smooth passage between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the court representative, Red Casino, pardoned the brother of the mayor of Monterrey on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legal representative, Red Casino, has pardoned him to the Second Criminal District Court, which is in the process of extorting the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos, in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution to allow the Montrey authorities to allow a secret operation in the gaming home.
Following a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor ' s brother and, on 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Department of Inheritance, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old capital of the State.
He remained at the site for 49 days, following the second ban order after the prosecutor had ruled out the offences of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereita for allegedly extorting half a million peso from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in a medium-segregated prison because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his stay in the municipal prison in San Nicholas in Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by Jorge Yanes, the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, who said that, after almost two months of investigations, it was clear that Jonas was guilty, such as levying 1.5 million peso from the bookies in exchange for permission of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to seek pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so he could be released in the following hours.
During the trial, the Public Prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if he had made up for the damage and which of the partners of the Gaming House would grant a pardon, even though the lawyer had tried to keep his name off the table.
On the basis of record 197/2011, a legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and no further statement could be made regarding the process that had been planned against him; nor would any compensation or punishment be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookie, at almost 3:50 p.m., Larrasabal Breton was ordered to be released immediately.
The court officer, Jorge Janes, went to the San Nicholas prison in Garza to inform Jonas that he had been legally pardoned and that his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Perez Hacome talks about the details of the disaster that killed the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MTS) reported that the results of the accident, in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others had been killed, had shown that the helicopter had hit the ground in complete integrity, without the pilot attempting to make an accident landing.
During a press conference, Dionicio Perez Hacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that the pilot had found that the weather was fit for flight before the aircraft went up.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the ship had a number of contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees 25 meters, where the medium lost the flue."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the necessary requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that the studies carried out in the area of impact did not indicate the presence of parts on the ground.
“The study states that there are no components of the vessel elsewhere, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for the transport of passengers.
The ground in this place has a slope of between seven and 30 degrees.
So far, the secretary said, the main thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study may take a few months or even a year.
In the meantime, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that the presidential helicopter had been driven at cruise speed during the strike and that it had been on soft, rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal summer manoeuvre at the moment of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Perez Hacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the air rules, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must be visible during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft was heading to the border between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where the layers of clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that because of the cloud conditions, the team was looking for a smaller and more visible area in the Cuernavac Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft's radar are the same, and it is likely that there was no loss of control or a change of direction prior to the impact.
Scatter of fragments in a small area:
The information available to date indicates that the impact occurred on the front and side lines.
The dispersion of the wreckage shows that the helicopter was impacted by structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
In the area of the disaster, there is undiscovered evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies have shown that there may have been multiple contacts with the land.
During their work on the ground, fragments of an aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground has a gradient of between 7 and 30 degrees.
The images show the sequence in which it collapsed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough study in more territory than the delimited zone near the site of the crash, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in a context of structural integrity.
MSS announces the obesity gene search program
Social protection leads research on the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN experts
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, which is known as the protocol “Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence”, which will provide an estimate of signs of overweight.
In his statement, the head of the Biochemistry Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (described or not) is invited to attend MSSI sports centres in Mexico City, where tests will be conducted with children from 8 a.m. every Saturday.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to run at a sports centre in Cuautemok, in the west of Mexico City, and that, since 8 October, the events had been held at a sports centre in Nesaualcovotl, in the east of Mexico City.
Once the target of between 500 and 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Centre (south Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north Mexico City).
He explained that the aim of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics for the development of obesity and to identify the risk factor among children and young Mexicans in order to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day will be observed, and the main objective is to bring together 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14, with the permission and supervision of their parents, to complete individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometry of all participants (weight, growth and waist cover), blood pressure and levels of glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to detect genes associated with child obesity) would be carried out.
Cruz Lopez said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in the weight of children.
Medical studies carried out between 1999 and 2006 indicate that in just six years there was an increase: 77 per cent of boys were obese, 47 per cent of girls; overweight, there was also a significant increase,” said MSSI.
He said that the validity of the search for markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other peoples in their genetic history.
He reported that, on average, the Mexican is 65 percent of the American Indians, 30 percent of the Europeans, and 5 percent of the Africans, and this condition has affected the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main effect of obesity genetics is the inability of the body to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and it is delayed in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark clippings on the neck(s) and forearms means the possibility of a break in metabolism and even a prediabeth.
The information is kept confidential, and the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the dimensions and changes in the way of life that must be made in order to avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main causes that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sit-down, or a lack of daily physical activity, the use of most of the day in front of the TV, and the use of small distances of transport instead of walking.
It is also due to high calories, i.e. the increase in the use of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tomatoes, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with high levels of fat and protein and genetic predisposition, as analysed in this programme.
Asphalt UNAM can avoid cracks
Raphael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Department of Chemistry, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mix of best quality resistant to the environment and temperature.
If the signals sent by the road cover had been given attention, it would have been necessary to repair about 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the Metropolitan Valley, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM chemical school, and adds that if the process of constructing and maintaining the asphalted road cover is correct, the number of pits can be reduced or reduced to zero.
In his lecture, the International Year of Chemistry ' s Technology View of Pipes states that the laboratory for which it is responsible is developing polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mix of properties close to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus to resist the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the hardest part of the oil, is the sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some are the high molecular mass, called asphalt, and others are the low molecular mass, called Maltens, which together provide road cover for its characteristic viscosity.
The viscosity of the bitumen is the fact that in high-temperatures about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 of its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it stays almost solid, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not permanent, but changes during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, by a chemical engineer.
The chemist observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible coating, which is made up of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen made of small rocks, put into bitumen and then compressed.
Every stone that forms this coating, he said, is immersed in bitumen.
When vehicles are moving and the effort is applied, it helps the forces to distribute very well on the road surface.
If it was a modified asphalt, they'd be even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt cover, he added, the last layer, which is called a decimation layer, is made of a small stone, in fact sand also immersed in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the transport, it must have more resistance than asphalt coatings and provide for road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute this effort, the wear layer also requires the proper thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
The weather, especially the humidity and temperature swings, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it has a significant impact on asphalt.
When the ground is raw, the water penetrates the coating, and it's hard to get out of it, it's softening all the layers of the coating, and so the formation of the pit.
In the formation of the pit, he said, the first thing to wear out is the wear layer, and then it only affects the bitumen, but the damage doesn't happen instantly, which is a process that should be taken into account at the first signs of maintenance programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transport is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each coating must always be linked to the transport load and must be guaranteed to meet this requirement in order to prevent the frequent occurrence of pits.
Rafael Herrera said that a lot of bitumen still needs to be studied and done, for example, with bitumen emulsions, which in other countries are already in the market and even help to fix holes with ease and with no high temperatures.
What's not enough for a candidate from Valle to become a new Miss Columbia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serne Melina Ramirez from getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Valle won the title of Princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca is just to want the crown of Miss Columbia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Cerna was to be content to be on the podium of the victors with a silver crown and a ribbon declaring her the new princess of Colombia.
In the light of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and scepter, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who were close to the crown, but who were declared princesses, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Patrice Belini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blanquez (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hisei Alhore Garces (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stefani Garces Alhur (2008).
The question that many now ask:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in each performance showed that she had everything to become a new Miss Columbia, for a reason she was chosen the Queen of Police and the most beautiful face in Vogue's version, titles that the Queens had, for example, Tatiana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who had won the crowns of Miss Columbia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of the First Princess was that she was unable to give a convincing answer to the question, "What book characterizes you and why? " by Martin Murilla Gomez of the Literary Society, let's read it.
She said to the person who asked:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I certainly think that the book that characterizes my childhood - "The Little Prince" - is a pretty deep book.
Today I read "Crime and Punishment," a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read, and at this moment I am reading the book of Irina Nemira, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "The Fire of Blood."
An answer that the jury didn't like because of the term “culture” and, secondly, because it didn't specifically explain how each of the quoted books described it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and content with the result: "the universe is wise, what's going to happen."
And all of you, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses put forward, Valle was burned out of favoritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that, as she was favored by the ovation, and she was a candidate who won all the pre-finished awards (Oster'sculinary competition, the viewer's vote for the best national suit, and the Queen's mother's), "which stirred the jealousy of the other candidates, caused the Queen's stress and, as a result, did not glance at the stage."
And it was recorded during her first appearance in a bathing suit on Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both of them, it was evident that she lacked the strength and energy that Magdalena and the Atlantic had shown.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the RCN program, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess " means that a candidate who wins more prizes during the competition will not become a queen."
In addition, the representative of Valle had recently avoided contact with the press, and that had been wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why, two days before the choice, Lucy Doty, a member of the international jury, said that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Columbia, we have to look not only at the looks but also at the public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they must be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also a suggestion that the representative of Valle had sinned by a defect on her buttocks and fibrosis, which was seen on her belly, but this is debatable, as the jury emphasized her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good food, and responsible physical work.
Queen Jorge Hernan Orosco's counselor notes that Melina had a bad body that was better, "but the problem of fibrosis on her belly, which was not very visible to me, made her lose her glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Cromos magazine believes that the error of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she had been subjected to surgical intervention.
"Operations are good, but representative Valle doesn't know how to make them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the award that was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the brutal prediction came true last night, they say it was a jewel that Raimundo gave to Melina as a compensation for having lost the pleasure of the crown.
Whether or not, the fact is that Melina is now starting a year of government, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions directly identified by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will be recorded as one of the queens, who, despite her excellent performance at the pageant in Cartagena, faced difficulties in getting the crown.
This was the work of the man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
CSI from Cali has entered history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the head of the FARC, Alfonso Kano, by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI experts, Elizar Gonzalez, a man from Puerto Tehad, who had spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation, had been in the queue this week.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Chocó, where he often had to travel for more than five days through the jungle to reach the location of the bodies that had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and, after completing the course, became a specialist in the field of forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. hands and towers.
During the week of Elizar's operation to identify a man known as Alfonso Kano, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Cauca to Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it externally; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He had no beard, dressed like a local farmer, no glasses, and a lot thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Using a magnifying glass, ink, a spatula, and a flashlight, Elizar compared the body's fingerprints to those on the picture.
His eyes did not fail: it was Alfonso Cano.
The same night, the Puerto Tehad representative was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that it was the head of the FARC
Search for Fingerprints
For a Dactilescope specialist at the Sijin unit in Cali, the confession received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar Gonzalez at a press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopie is a solid science, and it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, the Dactyloscopics are involved in the investigation of crimes, such as theft and murder, and identify the detainees.
At the time of arrest, many criminals had false or no identity cards.
We take their prints and we're looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in the event of the theft, he had to take a piece of the wall home because the thief had his hands in this place to possess a safe full of jewels and money.
"It's hard to work with walls because they're not easy to take prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole hand and I.D. the criminal who was involved in several thefts," he claims.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder-related cases.
A dead man with liquor bottles around him was recently found.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that a relative might have been suspected of having committed the crime and that, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although it doesn't guarantee that he was a killer, it proves he was at the scene of the murder.
A Dactilescope expert from CTI explained that a chemical or physical reagent is applied to the print sites.
When they appear, a spade or ribbon is used to remove them.
The prints are then sent to Asif, the criminal database, or entered in the register.
"The problem is we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves prints on it.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
"Angered People" defy the New York authorities.
Hundreds of protesters camped in front of the area of Zuccotti.
Some protesters listened to the court's decision to break the demonstration from the square and went to the park next door.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York City authorities on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square, under the protection of a court order, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to take over another Grand Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters dug up at the Zukotti Square, where they wanted to go, thanks to a court order that allowed "frequent people" to set up a camp in the square, while the other part of the movement responded to the break-up by taking over the park in the north of the city, where further arrests were made.
"Our idea is that, since the court won't let us set up a camp in the square, we'll build a camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a member of the "Take Wall Street" movement.
Bray explained that the response of the “frequent people” to the evacuation of the tentary, which was ordered personally by the Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, had come to court, where Judge Lucy Billings had issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the “frequent people” have begun to take over a new park, located at the junction site of the Canal Street Central Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York to New Jersey, and the parish of the Trinity Church.
At least an hour they could have taken the place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not tell the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen a number of journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization asserts that several hundred people were standing with tents in the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to show support to the members of the movement by trying to mediate talks with the police.
Meanwhile, Zukotti Square, which is private property, remains closed pending the trial scheduled for Tuesday, which will address the legality of this morning's protest.
Some of the protesters on their way there carried and distributed copies of the court order at the same time, and even provided copies to the police guarding the square, which led to “some small clashes”, said Bray, who claimed that some police officers had beaten the protesters.
The court order forbids the authorities to evacuate the members of the Occupy Wall Street movement and to enforce “the laws that have been promulgated since the beginning of the seizure, or to prohibit protesters from re-entering the park with shops and other property used earlier”.
Mayor Bloomberg told the reporters that, due to this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and the protesters had been informed of it, but local laws prevented them from reopening tent shops and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests had been carried out, and the decision was made because the protesters had “violation of the law”.
Bloomberg said that he had ordered the square to be cleaned, as it had become a “place where people had come not to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm others” because “some businesses had been threatened” and the neighbors feared “for the deterioration of the quality of life”.
The evacuation that took place this morning was repulsive and shows that, deep down, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” added the representative of the movement, who denounces the mayor for “disrespecting freedom of speech.”
Those responsible for the Wall Street Seizure also indicated that they intended to organize “grendiary action” on Thursday, in cooperation with social organizations and trade unions, in order to recall the last two months of the protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Bouble and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the TV program "Christmas Russell Peters" on December 1.
Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "The Great Repair", a rescuer at Malibu's Saviors, Bunny in Playboy, the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian TV.
The private TV CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the ballad pilot Michael Bubble and other prominent Canadians, would appear on "The Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1, as a very special Mary.
CTV today presented images of a TV show in which Anderson, also known for the Internet-wide home-grown pornographic video, shows up with her then husband, the drummer of the group "Mötley Crüe" by Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll in a crumble depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently performed as the host of the "My brutal torpedo of truth" tour, Charlie Sheena appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas show CTV features a Canadian singer, Bubla, who married Louisiana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who also knows how to deal with scandals.
Buble recently called the American bitch Kim Kardashian at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan, reintroduced after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent because of domestic consumption and ended the fall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has led to a nuclear crisis, a terrible catastrophe carried over by the country of the rising sun since the Second World War.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo government, the material loss was $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the dire world situation, seems to be happening.
After three consecutive lost quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September certainly helped to turn the page: GDP rose by 1.5 per cent over the previous quarter and by 6 per cent annually.
Registered in the second quarter, the fiscal year for the Japanese is starting in March 2012, also represents the fastest-growing rate from January to March 2010.
Renaissance may be due in part to the re-emergence of the purchase of machinery for the restoration of areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami that followed.
In fact, companies have increased their investment by 1.1 per cent, as opposed to a 0.9 per cent drop in capital spending, which was observed from January to March, the first drop after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for the use of the crisis to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan had been awakened, mainly by the development of household consumption, which now accounted for 60 per cent of Japan ' s GDP.
This figure has increased by 1 per cent as a result of the increase in the cost of motor vehicles, travel and rest.
The Mark of the Yen
Tokyo provided the domestic market, when the yen, the Japanese currency, became one of the “currency havens” chosen by the investors who want to get rid of the euro-zone debt crisis and the negative US forecasts, a privilege that puts rock pressure on the accounts of exporters.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a major blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sonia, for example, blames the yen for their low levels from July to September.
As long as markets continue to be under siege by the EU peripheral countries, the Government of Esichiko Noda does not lower its vigilance.
We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the dramatic rise in the value of the yen, said yesterday by the Minister of Economic Policy, Motohis Furukawa.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries had shown clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
An indicator that predicts the breaks in the world economy has shown that major forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below an average of 100 points after it crashed eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athenes again give cause for doubt
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatives won't sign any written commitments.
With peripheral risk and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to wander through the maze, leading to an end to the big European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new transitional government of Ellad is being imposed more on the demand of Brussels than on the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be supported by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reform and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient to implement it, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said that he would not support new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, said Papadimos yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will result tomorrow in a vote of confidence in the new executive branch.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform of the Public Service Disciplinary Code and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
But the message of Samaras does not make his position clear: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we promise nothing."
The Conservative Leader has taken one step more in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, the organizations that should defrost the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and he has explained that he will not give his approval to any letter of consent to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritating by the effect of the Papandrew-style referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demands are clear: it will not resume assistance unless the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign a “written agreement without any ambiguities and as soon as possible”.
A representative of the Ministry of Economics, Amadeu Altafay, said that the troika inspectors could “return very soon” to Athens to discuss with the new government “what must be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date is not yet set.
There's enough thread in the Greek cube for a while.
Miss Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope."
The Queen emphasized the “main” place of Spain in respect of this type of finance.
Spain has "been a prominent place in the world in the area of micro-finance."
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades the country had become the second largest donor to the instruments of cooperation, whose “essentialness” she said was that it was “a tool of social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all mankind, based on faith in humans”.
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolide yesterday, convinced that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “perfectly necessary” to meet the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “especially with the aim of halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the “fuck of poverty” is recorded.
Spain “already works” to expand the network of recipients around the world and assumes this task with all “responsibility”, says Doña Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women, the “primary recipients of these loans”.
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is becoming not only a forum for debate, but also a platform that promotes “two main goals”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and that one hundred million of those households would escape the poverty in which they were immersed.
The impulse to create a micro-credit system in Spain and the rest of the world “walked along the path begun years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Ms. Sofia as a “act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as “a marvellous idealist in the global fight against poverty, whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to look at his lending policy on the ground.
This experience took over the first World Summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “everywhere I have seen continuous development”, said Her Majesty, whose connection to the project gave her the title of the “head of the family” that was gathered in Valladolid by the “poor banker.”
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her statement by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez said that solidarity is an “ethical imperative” for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, since it was a “continuing commitment”.
Jiménez concluded that micro-credit implies a “serious and firm course of action aimed at eradicating poverty” and that “more than ever” developed-country Governments must work in solidarity and prevent it from falling short of spending.
For Spain, micro-credit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, commended the “success” in giving “confidence” to people who are “opened, all doors closed” and the Mayor of Valladolide, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed all those present in a city that “opens its doors in a spirit of solidarity”.
The CDU proposes to elect the Chairman of the European Commission by universal vote
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CPU) on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, was held without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the president of the Christian Democratic Party.
Europe’s future was not originally scheduled in the program, but it was in the fall itself, in particular to satisfy the activists who believe that government policy is far from as strict as it should be today with regard to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with respect to Italy....
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, which had been tabled by the management, had been adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine had voted against and 10 had abstained.
The standing ovations, which lasted for a few minutes, which deserved to speak by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schoible, the eurofile and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main message of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is “not less than Europe, but more Europe”.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the chancellor, it's time for a breakthrough in Europe.
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty that make it possible to strengthen European Union control over eurozone financial policies, but it may also affect the election of the European Commission president by a universal vote “to give Europe a face”.
In any event, it is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, the idea of which is obviously the one of Wolfgang Schöble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly accept this decision; Britain is opposed to it, and HDZ leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed to it.
But the ground is ready.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the voice of each EU member country in the European Central Bank, according to the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In an effort to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor had increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kole, but she had not sought to influence the Congress at the expense of “small” European countries or countries in distress, who liked to criticize the “higher” Germany.
While the draft resolution on Europe devoted an entire paragraph to the importance of “German-French friendship, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just bypass.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud with hospital sheets?
Following the cash benefits, the UMP and the government began to attack hospital sheets.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will come to Bordeaux to visit the Family Allowances Fund and give a speech on the subject, which has been on the rise since 2007, on the fight against social benefit fraud.
And to help this attack, which arose out of the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also part of the right-wing presidential re-election campaign, most want to focus on hospital sheets.
In the first place, with a view to budget savings, the Government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on private companies prior to the start of the payment of the benefit.
It is evident that, without the special consent of the employer, the sick worker will lose his or her salary in four days, at a minimum of 15 per cent of his or her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to create a storm of anger, but that, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euro.
And that will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose one day on public servants without a sickness benefit (public servants have not yet had to wait for the payment of the benefit, as opposed to a three-day waiting period for private sector employees).
Now that these issues are under discussion, the majority also re-emerges the subject of fraud, with a view to the abuse of hospital sheets.
Control will become more strict, and in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all the illegal payments you received,” warned Xavier Bertrand on the RTL channel on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital sheets.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subject to constant control and political attacks, which bear fruit.
People in France are no more ill than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the national figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million Euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily compensation costs of Euro11.3 million in 2008 amounted to 5 per cent of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent related to maternity leave and industrial accidents and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, which amounted to Euro6.2 million.
And therefore, 2.5 percent of the health-related costs.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days on hospital in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group study.
The average arithmetic, which conceals some of the deviations; another study published in 2007 by the Monster.com Career Management website showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers interviewed said that they had not taken a day of hospitalization.
Another study, this time concerning health insurance, states that in 2010 37 per cent of hospital patients lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to 1 month, 15 per cent from 1 to 3 months, and 11 per cent longer.
When compared to European neighbors, it is evident that French workers are no more likely to take hospital than any other country.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total unemployment rate in France (for health reasons or not) was 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared to 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The rate of fraud associated with hospital sheets is very low compared to the “gray” of employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has led to a systematic check of hospital lengths of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term sickness reports were “unjustified” or too long, which is 37,050.
In the case of systematically checked hospital sheets for more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unsubstantiated”, which is 132,000.
In general, it turns out that 169,000 cases were “unjustified” for a number of millions of employees who had received hospital forms.
Figures that show very few cases in comparison to, for example, the numbers of the “growth” of employment.
According to UMP member Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on the subject, they amount to between Euro9 million and Euro15 million in uncollected revenue per year, which is higher than the total cost of daily compensation, and is therefore infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos announced this to Parliament, adding that the 100 days allocated to his coalition Government was not sufficient to carry out this task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme,” said the head of government, who made his first public statement, opening the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October should be the “primary task” of the new government, since the country's presence in the eurozone was “in the process of being at stake”, he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos forecasts a reduction in the country's budget deficit to “about 9 per cent” of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right rejects the new Government's actions
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support further austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the deputies of his party New Democracy.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that impeded economic recovery.
Ollie Renu, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary credit of 8,000 million euro without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words had been enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
There is a need to legalize euthanasia and suicide with extraneous help, claims the Committee of Experts
The Canadian is denied death, as stated in a report by the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee argues that the Government, health-care institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, excluding cancer.
Canadese is denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die, and to take steps in that direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the criminal code to allow for extraneous suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is imposed by circumstances, and the patient may be considered competent to make such a decision.
For starters, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Office, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries.
While Canada is ranked 10, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Because of medicinalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6 percent of them die in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and extraneous suicide, the report concludes that it is contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code with respect to euthanasia and extraneous suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse of use, i.e. euthanasia or extraneous suicide against people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, at a teleconferencing session, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed most of the cases in countries where euthanasia and extraneous suicide had not been legalized.
Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide with extraneous help is practised in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
Remember, 85% of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia, because, according to an Angus Reid survey in 2010, they believe that this will help people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66 percent believe that legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are of less value.
In the case of people who had provided suicidal assistance, 41 per cent of the respondents believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest, among other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that the legal termination of medical care is not an offence.
The Committee of Experts also requires health professionals to be trained in a spirit of respect for the abandonment of health care at the end of their lives without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee called on the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal session already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requires that it be used when it does not serve to collide physical pain like euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some health-related law experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metre Pierre Deshan, a health law specialist, described the “extreme” position of the experts who had signed the report as not limiting the use of euthanasia to death, among other things.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years of age can ask for suicidal help, says the metre Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metro Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the independence of the individual above all other values that form the social fabric of society.
He said that "there are warning signs and bans in society."
The health law specialist, Margaret Somerville, also expresses “a categorical opposition to the findings of the report, which she described as a “manifest for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, inter alia, the report concerning abuses in some countries where euthanasia and extraneous suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to give way to power
Damascus denounces "conspiracies"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar Assad's supporters held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria, Bashar Al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, resisted it and condemned “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria ' s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union had tightened the sanctions against Damascus, and Syria ' s neighbours, Turkey and Jordan, had advocated the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call upon President Bashar Assad to give way to Syria, where some 40 more civilians and members of the regime ' s armed forces were killed.
"If Bashar had a dear interest in his country, he should have resigned, but he also had to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, "says the King of Jordan, next to Syria, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, expressed his regret that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which had begun earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot meet their aspirations will lose power, he said, in hindsight on Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly strict course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “extension of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly strict course against repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a representative of the Department of State.
Since then, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime ' s armed forces have lost their lives in the Dar ' a area of southern Syria, reports the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two others died in a gunfight and a heavy machine gun fire in Jobar in the besieged town of Homs, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, stated that the country was nearing the end of the crisis.
In addition, he reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to remove Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, believing that this plot against Syria would fail."
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers to be placed in the country.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Alain Juppe, also expressed his support for the dispatch of UN monitors to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime that he said had fallen into a “paranoia”.
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the 2 November crisis recovery plan, which includes the withdrawal of the armed forces from fighting towns and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, yesterday called the League of Arab States' decision “uncorrect”, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to emerge from the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from markets and Italian victims
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monty, asked the markets for a little time to form a team and implement a program that would require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European commissioner yesterday participated in discussions with the political parties prior to today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet, composed of technocrats who are not members of Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a multi-victim programme, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the discussions following a meeting with a candidate for the post of Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he would have waited to see if Mario Monty would have asked the Parliament to vote on trust by Friday to make sure that the new government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with the presentation by Mr. Monty of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to head of the country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented yesterday on the nerves of stock exchanges and bond holders, asking them for time.
When “democracy takes time to prepare the government and the programme, he stressed, adding that he is convinced that markets will be patient and will show understanding.”
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but concern rekindled, particularly after the sudden fall of industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he also wanted to include “policies”.
The new government would be in operation until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Djanfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of parliamentary confidence on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that, by entering the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Ren stressed that “despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet the 2013 budget, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, had required, inter alia, new strict measures.
The Italian boss of the bosses, Emma Marchegalya, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of the deficit."
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented the “myriad of the era” for Italy after 17 years of Berlusconism, a “professor” symbolizing “the challenge of seriousness” and “the other Italy”, according to the authors of the novels.
The great unknown is the durability of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid short-term elections, as by April 2012, Italy was to make payments in the amount of Euro200,000 on public debt.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scientist Viacheslav Danilenko helped Iran to develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, and confirmed on Monday the United States Agency specializing in the field of nuclear danger.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations agency to establish the identity of the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military dimension” of Iran's nuclear programme
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years “from the 1960s on, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds with the methods of explosion”.
He left the centre in 1989 or 1991 to set up a company that produces neo-malms in Kyiv.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia
In its report, the IAEA mentions “the clear signs that Iran's development of the nuclear detonator system has “provided the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technology well, but who also informed the Agency that he had been working most of his career on this technology as part of the military nuclear programme of his home country”.
Anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined slightly or did not change over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in attacks on Jews, and an overall 14 per cent increase in religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, rose very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After the fall in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is on the rise again, as Human Rights First, “the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, adds the organization in the official report.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered serious human rights violations,” added a head of the organization, Paul Lejandre.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
Hate crimes in federal law are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation today.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter microblog site changed the presentation of its platform to allow users to see, inter alia, the activity of the people they're following, making the service look like Facebook.
The new "activities" tab and the other "name" make it possible to follow more easily and directly the activities of the other Twitters, the Internet users whose messages ("twits") you're following, and those who track yours.
This makes it possible to learn if they publish messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "at a low percentage of the users in August" before being released on the whole network on Monday, and announced to the AFP that Carolyn Penner would be the Twitter Spokesperson.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as intuitively rather incomprehensible and as using relatively vague terms (RT for the posting of someone else's message, #followfree for the recommendation to track other users), is largely a pleasure to experienced users, opening up to a wider audience, presenting to users something more close to the popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the Internet, users have discussed this innovation via Twitter on the Internet.
"It's pointless, obsessive, and overreacting to Facebook."
Functional activity will help me to better track certain elements of my Twitter stream, written by @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Incorporation of the “golden rule” budget in the Constitution
The leadership of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write a budget “gold rule” in the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrading of Austria's public credit rating agencies (triple A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrats, Werner Faimann, personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with Austrian public debt of 74.6 per cent, which is far higher than the top 60 per cent threshold set by the Treaty of Maastricht, but lower than the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay had fallen by just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by 3,000 million Euros more each year, the Vice-Chancellor's argument and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Christian Democrats, Michael Spindegger.
Austria is thus complying with the Eurozone Summit of 26 October in Brussels; the heads of State and Government have demanded a reduction in fiscal deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through the Constitution or an equivalent law.
The order adopted by the Austrian Government is similar to the “German model” since Germany was the first European country to adopt this “rule”.
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and since 2017 the structural deficit of the federal State budget should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP in any year, and the land, like the communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The aim is to force public debt to fall below the 60% mark of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esihiko Noda
Threatens new intervention in the currency market
Japan’s Prime Minister, Yeshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would undertake new currency market intervention if the yen’s value continued to rise.
We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we consider the exchange rate of the yen to be excessive, Mr. Noda explained it to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen grew to almost a historic point that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had set a new record of power since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown constantly, driven by the purchases of investors, who view it as a “refugee” in these worrisome times of global economic collapse and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the 105 yen symbolical bar, close to the level that led to the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen, and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is damaging to Japan’s exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converting to national currency.
“Japan is fighting to rebuild itself” after the 11 March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who fears that the yen's growth will kill the fragile embryo of reconstruction.
The third largest economic Power in the world resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in the year, thanks to the growth in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect the “fundamental economic performance of Japan”.
Minister of Finance Jun Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day session of its monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Manager of Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “the appropriate steps” to make it clear that no further mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting in late October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47,000 million euro), raising to 55,000 million yen (519 million euro) the ceiling of the amounts it spends on the purchase of various financial instruments to saturate the market for securities.
Eurozone
The stakes are rising, the stock exchanges are fluctuating
European indexes undermine the risk of debt crisis.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in volatile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further to the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and finished the bid at 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, and London fell by 0.1%.
Due to new difficulties in the payment of credit to the eurozone countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"Concerned investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Exchange closed down with a drop of 0.7 per cent under the weight of new market doubts about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the narrow change corridor until investors can prove that the situation has stabilized,” states Mitsushige Akino, the manager of the Ichioshi Investment Management Foundation
This return of concern for the future of the eurozone is striking a single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1,3570, falling by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, it fell after the Congress of chancellor's party, Angela Merkel HDZ, on Monday, at which a resolution was adopted, including the possibility for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are substantially higher than 6%
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
On Tuesday morning, Italian ten-year bond returns reached 6.85 per cent, and Spanish bond returns with the same maturity reached 6.2 per cent.
These difficulties with interest rates in the south, but also in France, continue to feed the concerns of the participants.
Mario Monty, head of the future of the Italian government, has asked the time exchanges to restore the situation in Italy, which is at risk of paralysis under the weight of his debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the “primary task” of his Government.
Spain was hit by markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between interest rates for Germany and Spain's 10-year debt reached a new historic maximum.
Expecting the eurozone's growth figures
France recorded a growth rate of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnating.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment for the whole eurozone is expected at 11:00 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas
If there is a theme that cannot be decided after a brief discussion or under the influence of emotion, it is an energy policy.
Accessibility and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that election meetings become a reason to reflect on the share and place of nuclear power.
The dispute will not bear fruit unless all the economic, social and environmental implications of the options proposed are studied.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
We now have 7,000 million people on the planet, and demographic development will lead to a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, unless the vast majority of the world's population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the increasing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity on an ongoing basis, bearing in mind the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to address the climate imbalance, a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima crash does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision contingent on the need to find a source that can replace nuclear power, or of Switzerland, which intends to construct only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, are just a few that are moving forward with determination.
The United States decided, after Fukushima, to add one plant to its kit by restarting the construction of the station that had been interrupted after the accident in Tri Mile Island.
While the model of Germany based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, the reality is contrary to this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, and a rise in CO2 emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be visible.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
The European Turbine Champion, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; thus, CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than the French households.
Since in a globalized economy, the price of energy is a key factor in the competitiveness and maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will result in a significant increase in the cost of electricity, which will illusoryly make beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French refuses to pay, especially because they do not object to this kind of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirects.
Highly export-oriented, it attracts an entire pool of specialized international small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France had decided to give up nuclear power, it would have to donate more of those enterprises and lose 6,000 million Euros a year from the French export of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electric engineer will order an EPR calculated to work for 60 years if the manufacturer is scheduled to close down?
To solve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions shows that energy sources are complementary.
For nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of safety is certainly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that has uncompromising and transparent control of existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same security obsessiveness.
Over 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, occurred under normal conditions of exploitation, but without any human or environmental consequences
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and the unforgivable human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural catastrophes of an unprecedented force that led to the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from the accident, as it did from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the co-operation between the security authorities, the operators and the French and German designers, EPR, is a project to counter such phenomena.
As it is viewed by all energy experts who want to build a reactor, stopping it in Flamanville will be an excellent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to find the best mix of energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a good thing for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the overload of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a “State of human rights”.
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which was in the news when the Minister of the Interior (Liberation of 23 May) said that France “does not need foreign talents, stoners, and waiters.”
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is much agreement between the right and left on this issue.
On the right hand side, Jacques Chirac, who stated in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers,” and on the left hand side, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “can't accept the poor from all over the world”.
Variances in the level of generosity only
In 2005, fear of entry into the country by a Polish plumber was felt by both the left and the right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they allow to show to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande limited himself to banalism, saying that “joint work will solve our immigration problem”.
This view of immigration as a burden and a problem can have an elective advantage, but it is very expensive.
As we are reminded by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that summed up the latest data on immigration (Specific People: How Migration Made Our World and Determines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University, 352 s.), there is a wide consensus among professionals about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that accept immigrants.
Restriction of immigration leads to weakening growth and lowering employment.
Fears of immigrant influence are based on the notion that they can replace local workers, especially low-skilled workers, by causing lower wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than replacing the local labour force by performing jobs for which there is a lack of local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job offers.
A positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the overlap between locals and immigrants has led to a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1% in the migration flow results in an increase of 0.6% to 0.9% in real long-term wages.
And this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (one of the Nobel laureates in the United States is a high proportion of naturalized immigrants, while Google, Intel, Paypal, and Yahoo are all found by immigrants).
Migrants also make net returns to social security systems, giving an average of 1 per cent of the total European budgets.
The World Labour Organization, for example, estimates that an immigrant in Germany, when he arrives at the age of 30, will make a net profit in his or her life (income minus expenditure) on average 150,000 Euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was about to be gripped by the “tangs” in the missing growth points.
These teeth, which were used to frighten immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, left to reflect on European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but also a delicate one.
The European continent must remember that, by inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gouga, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and the colonels in Greece.
Some believed that for democracy to win over its enemies, it was enough to vote and make it as direct as possible.
From Napoleon's day, "The Little" knows it's from the surface of the mind.
A universal vote, though a precondition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition, and may even be a “tool of repression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vásro once said.
No, democracy requires much more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, and justice.
The European crisis we are facing is an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this respect, the palinosia of a true-lived Greek referendum will have a double-demonstrative effect, demonstrating both the need for a major change in policy and the disheartening sense of its impossibility and incoherence.
This duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy is now moving and, in the view of many, the Republican soldiers are now targeting the wrong way.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referenda organized as needed and in a chaotic order.
"Cart Blanche" for an absolute European monarch, or jumping with his legs tied to the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we dream not of a guillotine blade, but of a joint, clear and continuous choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and we don't know how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis: the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is under the dictation of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and a lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is totally humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent that the management of the European project be restored to national sovereignty.
Because it is only by working together that Europeans can reduce the debt burden of everyone, free themselves from markets, and prepare for the future by investing in it.
A solution to the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to a catastrophe.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the socialists and Jacques Delore, everyone now demands a European economic government.
Let's do that.
But to think of it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has been built up in the countryside is another madness and a new dead end.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to create a republic.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a united Europe at the economic level.
This can be done only by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true national European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Uncontacted chip cards are spreading more and more.
The world chip card show opens on Tuesday in Wilpenta, near Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM phones), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6,000 million units.
The most important sector of uncontacted technology is the sector that pays for public transport or purchases by simply handing a map over the reader.
This year, 460 million uncontacted chip cards will be sold in the world, up from 320 million a year ago!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected to be 580 million units) to almost 10 per cent of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of uncontacted payments.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function, and 75,000 terminals accept them.
France is starting in a more modest way: 400,000 non-contact cards are in circulation.
But big shops are getting faster.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCards.
To move at a higher rate, banks need to provide equipment to their clients.
“The two big organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute bank cards for uncontacted use to their clients in the future,” Gérard Nebuy, Director General of Visa Europe France, reported.
Banks test payments with a mobile phone.
But this is just the first step in the future of the means of payment, that is, a mobile phone.
So far, only a handful of machines are equipped with the NFC (Communication of the Nearfield) technology needed to carry out such transactions.
"They have been postponed.
"But they have to really break up next year."
"We count on the world sales of between 80 and 120 million units in 2012, "explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June of next year in Qana.
The iPhone equipment of some 200 clients and staff members will be provided with cover that provides uncontacted payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also announced yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal to allow his clients to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spreading from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links of the Islamic Maghreb to the Boko Haram sect.
Long-expected links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram were confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that the Algerians were now confident.
“The help that the two organizations use, and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without entering into detail.
Paris seems to have come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two French men in the Niger in January revealed two links.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Léokur and Vincent Delori, apparently were killed the next day, along with several of the kidnappers, during an operation conducted by the French Special Forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, the French and Nigerian investigators found a number of SIM cards belonging to the terrorists.
The axis of terror
An analysis of the calls revealed a number of interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers, one referring to a Nigerian who lived for a long time in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram cradle, and the other to a man who is said to be close to Aqmi and a sect.
"This is a step forward, but no doubt we have to wait for more reliable evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"For many years it has been known that the cult has received external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active, "says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in Boko Haram's actions and statements and in its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community, led by Washington, now puts pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of enlightened people of no interest.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at the mosque, school and imam-fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is sin" - preaches the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It is politicized and requires strict respect for the sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central government.
It focuses on churches, bars, and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuji's reaction is, as usual, uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left behind 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and will go beyond its northern suburbs.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an act that killed 80 people in Joss, and then for another one in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram launched the first suicide attack against a reinforced police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The establishment of the terrorist axis in Africa, which is coming from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a matter of concern to all security experts.
Now that Aqmi has been strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from Al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with the presidents of Goodluck, Jonathan Alain Juppe warned Boko Haram of the danger and expressed his willingness to share all the available information.
The world, as it is seen by the Republican presidential candidates
With regard to China, Iran, and Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world with simple, or, more precisely, simplistic ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, the voters might believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have been multiplicating loud, but devoid of details about foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong part of the Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and Israel are often mixed.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of being nominated by the Good Party's Old Age, threatened to lodge a complaint with the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of “manipulating his currency is a sensitive theme for America, irritated by the migration of its entire industries to Asia.
Worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Obama’s Ambassador to China, and the only candidate who is familiar with complex foreign policy, has failed to fight a position that is embracing emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stays at the bottom of the ratings, has not been heard.
Reagan style
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if the sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to step up military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of failing to keep his promises to that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second in the candidate ratings, showed discouraging ignorance of the case.
He had recently called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing was trying to achieve nuclear power - obviously not knowing that China had it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks on Iran, says he's ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The 2009 Obama-prohibited terrorist suspects are also recommended to be tortured by Kane, Perry, and Michel Bachman.
All of this is far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama was a lover himself and that he had to lower the tone with regard to the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the “boys” from Iraq, his manoeuvres in Libya, which gave him the reputation of weak politics.
But the attack is not that simple.
The people consider a positive balance of national security under Obama, which eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that binds it in the sand.
And, asserting that America needs to be rebuilt economically to restore its leadership, Obama is right.
The North Flux, the new gateway to the Russian gas entering Europe.
The Northern Pipeline, which connects Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is being launched.
It is designed to provide gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate the event with pop.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between the band's performance and the exquisite snacks, in the opening of the North Flux, a new gas pipeline that directly links Russia and Germany underwater.
German chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fion, and his Dutch colleague Martha Rütte together turned the symbolic valve that controlled the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
Under the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million extra cubic meters of gas will flow to Western Europe each year through the first pipeline, which is 1,224 km long, linking Leningrad region to the land of Meklenburg-Mexia.
The second pipeline is to be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas equivalent to the total consumption of France.
And the possibility of constructing a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met the ferocious resistance of Poland and the Baltic States.
The Northern Flux will indeed allow the direct flow of gas to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Polish or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power, making it harder for them to influence Russia, threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the most stressful moment of Warsaw's debate, it did not stop from comparing the North Stream with the new “German-Soviet Pact”, insinuating an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supply.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has been able to reach an understanding of a direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consumes large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are running out.
“This gas pipeline is part of the cooperation with Russia, it's a new artery that organically binds us,” said François Fion, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both politically and economically important.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of gas arrival.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipe is made of steel in concrete to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It's at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left since the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, the North Flux Press Secretary.
There was also a need to take many steps to protect fauna and flora.
Pipeline is a long metallic snake weight equal to the weight of 242 Eiffel towers, without ruptures all over the length, without valves, and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers gave it up because Sweden was not thrilled that a Russian public company would live on its shores forever.
"In the event of an accident, we'll cut the gas flow in less than a minute," Jens Müller claims.
So, in case of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will be released into the air.
But that seems unlikely to be the designer who designed seams that are designed to leak once every 100,000 years.
The state of the pipeline will be monitored by a submersible robot, which is dragging the ship, for external surveillance, and by a machine circulating inside the pipeline.
A cigar-like machine is injected in a 1 metre diameter pipe and pushed forward by a gas stream.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at 3 meters per second, it provides accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed for 50 years without the need for the slightest repairs.
Gas circulation is done only by its pressure.
It is 200 bars at the time of departure and 100 bars at the time of arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement the project.
The leader is Gazprom, who owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9 per cent each).
The five companies had established a joint venture, called the North Flux, which had been charged with constructing and operating a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Tsugu in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for 20 years, with the possibility of an extension of the full volume of gas transport.
"Gasprom will pay for the full volume, no matter how much gas will actually be transported," Jens Müller claims.
Financing for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30 per cent of the shareholders and 70 per cent of the bank loans.
The total cost of the work will be Euro7.4 million for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they will pay for their costs, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas line is coming out of the Baltic Sea in Ljubmin to a sandy shore planted with soft trees.
The vents are four and a half meters high and form the outlet of the gas terminal.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into the German gas pipelines.
From last Tuesday, the terminal gets one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity, it's going to be 3 million an hour, and in 2012 it's going to be 6 million.
Moleskine Brand Notebook
Moleskine, created by the Italian company 15 years ago, will bring back the taste of the letter.
He's got the aroma of adventure, hours spent after the letter in the light of the candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easy to recognize by the rectangular black cover, by the rubber, by the yellow-and-white pages, as if yellowed over time.
However, the notebook Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch design notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's then consultant, assumed responsibility for launching a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old technique, the moleskin, the lacquered cotton tissue used, for example, to cover the bench.
This type of notebook is said to be highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine aligned with the taste of today's old and forgotten thing that was cultivating for the Avonardist artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, who had since become the managing brand at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales rose by 25 per cent to 12.7 million.
We went far from producing the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is hard to set the profile of a typical buyer, because the notebook attracts a businessman, a student, and a man of a free trade.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks at Fnac bookshops, shops in small-town centers, and has been able to gain wide visibility.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter, despite the advent of e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; the brand has recently organized an exhibition entitled "The Great Way", where architects and artists have shown their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched the cover of a leopard picture at the Locarno Film Festival.
Using his success and his cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and Brand has all kinds of support.
A success that led to envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, now Syntegra Capital, which added a new page to Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19 per cent of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week of work for disabled people begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still double the average, 19 per cent as opposed to 9 per cent for the general population.
Disappointing?
"No," says Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of work for disabled people.
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"The unemployment rate was not 2 at that time, but 3 times that."
"But there's still a lot of work to do."
It must be said that there are still many barriers to employment for a disabled person.
Of these, 37 per cent are older than 50 years of age (17 per cent, on average).
They are more of a low-level student: 80 per cent do not have a bachelor ' s degree, and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, as opposed to 38 per cent on average.
In short, all of these criteria, which make it very difficult to return to work and which are the core of the problem,” says Christian Grapen, Director General Trempling, an association set up in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about mentality, which is changing, but too slow.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre Association, commissioned by Cité, showed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability and “represented complete people in carts or mentally or mentally disabled”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from having 6 per cent of disabled workers, as set out in the Act of 1987.
The last known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"Today we're about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General Agefiph, an organization responsible for tax collection from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of “obligated” organizations, like the amounts paid, fell from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which raised the tax, created strong pressure on the companies," Pierre Blanc explains.
“But this improvement also reflects a rise in awareness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers, compared to 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness."
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday night (20.45 a.m.), Eden Azar and Georges Leekens did not conceal the pleasure they had gained from this friendly match.
We will not go to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
At the scene of the arena, Stade de France, Georges Leekens, and Eden Azar made up.
Five months after his attacker's game against Turkey, a Belgian coach can only commend him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his progress, and the fact that he's a Belgian."
"I want to go on,," says the player Lille.
As for the contrast between his performance in the club and the team, it's one thing, he's justifying it.
"I'm in Lille all year long, but I'm not in Belgium."
"I have to make my points."
Left in reserve, in the run-up to this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to St. Denis to finally "greeze."
Not forgetting, however, the concept of pleasure.
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the 1998 and 2000 victory campaigns.
"I've always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special nature of this match.
And especially that on the other side are Mathieu (Debushi), Johan (Cabe) and Adil (Rami),” he remembers.
"Just our roads crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens was kind enough to remember "holy."
"The Pride" to play "the Christmas match."
Pride also claims that France “renewed to be a very high-level team” just a year after the trauma in Neuzna.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, admired him.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, a tech athlete will fly in the same plane as the Blues... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll find out in future games, including this one against France."
Portugal is very confident
Portugal, Paulo Bento, is starting a match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to it, both teams seemed to have lost a sense of reality.
"By the end of this 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the team, which has been in control since September 2010, has been classified as Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a match to play, and there's a Bosnia that needs to be won.
Given the 0-0 on Friday in Zenica's hell, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal had dominated the match for over an hour, it had not been able to achieve a cherished goal that would comfort her.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk."
But at their brightly lit stadium de la Lus in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, who should be thrilled, even though the match will be very intense,' said the optimistic but sensible Bent.
"We expect a very intense match, but we are convinced we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of getting to the Euro 2012," said Carlusse Queiroz's successor.
No one on Friday's match against Bosnia requires the Portuguese to win.
No one could have arranged for the Bosniacs.
"This is a good result, which, however, has some risk, - regrets Bent.
"We're gonna play against a team that has a lot of technical merit and has a lot of individual merit," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosniacs from the start, "no time to think."
It's a good idea to be realistic this time.
