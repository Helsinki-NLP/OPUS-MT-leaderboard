The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has signed a law imposing administrative liability for the violation of the time and procedure for the payment of goods (work, services) in the procurement of public and municipal needs.
The Act is intended to address the very acute problem of non-performance by clients in the conduct of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation in which businessmen were unable to receive payment under existing State and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Office of the Attorney-General of the Russian Federation to take the problem into special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not deal with unscrupulous clients who had entered into unfunded contracts, tried to avoid their obligations to pay, and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of businessmen to be paid under public orders, the Office of the Public Prosecutor has submitted 9,000 submissions, with the result that 4,500 officials have been disciplined and 533 administrative officers, and 75 files have been submitted to the investigative bodies for the purpose of organizing procedural checks, 46 of which have led to criminal proceedings.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles of business debt was paid.
These huge sums have not been accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion-dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts have led to huge debts.
Here's the case.
The manager of the small company won a competition for social transport services for a number of millions of roubles.
The man invested all his working money, fully met his obligations, but did not get the money on time.
The result is an increasing financial coma of salary, tax, credit that would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought the help of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The problem has now been resolved as far as possible in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of public and municipal debt identified by the procurators of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical levels, the Public Prosecutor's Office is working in a manual crisis management environment.
The Attorney-General personally holds visiting meetings with the local authorities to deal in detail with all the violations that the procurators have revealed and to deal with them without delay.
Such operational meetings have already taken place this year in Jaroslavla and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ “On the amendment of the Code of Administrative Offences in order to establish the administrative liability of the employer's officials for the violation of the time and procedure for the payment of goods (work, services) in the conduct of public and municipal purchases”, signed last week by the President of the Russian Federation, will improve the quality of the discipline of public clients.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Attorney-General ' s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences with an article which provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for the violation by the employer of the time and procedure for the payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If an official had already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he or she would be disqualified for a period of between one and two years.
All the procurators of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure that these legislative innovations are applied in practice.
Civil Rights Unit issued a travel warning to Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement is as follows: “Warning for travelers of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African American travelers, visitors and citizens of Missouri to be particularly alert and to be more cautious in traveling around the state in connection with a number of suspicious racist incidents that have recently taken place all over the state and have been brought here.”
According to the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population, the recent Missouri law, which made it more difficult for people to win claims of discrimination, and the fact that state law enforcement authorities disproportionately target members of minorities.
“You are subject to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin color, beaten and killed,” Rhode Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri, said to the newspaper Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints more often than ever.”
This is the first warning of this kind announced by the organization to the state of the United States.
The Group referred to incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at Missouri University and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas on his trip to the state, and Missouri State Police arrested him without charge of a crime.
The warning also refers to a recent report by the Attorney General of Missouri State, according to which it is 75 per cent more likely to be stopped on the road for black drivers than for white drivers.
“The aim of the warning is to make people aware of the situation and to alert their relatives and friends and colleagues to what might happen in Missouri,” said Chapel.
“People must be trained in one way or another, whether they will take the money to bail or tell their families that they are traveling through state territory.”
According to the latest FBI hate crime report, there were 100 hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, making the state the 16th state in terms of the number of such violations.
A travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri State Act, which will make it more difficult to bring a case against a legal person for housing or work discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ALU) had issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona after the state had enacted new immigration control laws, which required local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which ACLU believed should have increased the number of racial checks.
Moving warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but more recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Two people died as a result of the shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown men fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reporting the Reuters with a reference to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the exchange of fire, two people, including one policeman, were killed and three injured.
All wounded have been taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on the law enforcement officers.
One of the intruders was detained, the other managed to escape.
Rostourism supports the law abolishing free baggage for non-return flights
The head of Rostourism, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview with RBC TV that “positively” refers to the adoption of a law abolishing the free passage of baggage on non-return flights.
"A person who has no luggage must be allowed to buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has a bag," he stressed (the TASS quote).
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that, despite the fear of the citizens, it would not be necessary to pay for the carriage of the outer clothes and the mobile phone in a hand-held box.
"It would be right to comfort all of our citizens and tourists and to report it, to say it's for top clothes, for umbrellas, for cell phones, for iPads, or even for some computer," said the head of Rostourism.
Formerly, Russian President Vladimir Putin had signed a law providing for the right of airlines to rule out the provision for the free passage of baggage on a non-returnable flight.
This means that airlines can determine for themselves the number of spaces and the weight of baggage included in the non-return rate.
Vladimir Poetin commissioned the elimination of the pollution of the Baikal
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on the protection of Baikala, reported that in recent years significant areas of the lake had been severely polluted.
It mandated the identification of sources of funding, plans and implementers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Poetin has also commissioned a full-scale rehabilitation of polluted areas.
"We also need to deal with the sites that continue to work here, most of them have worn out," quotes the President's RIA News.
He also added that the Office of the Attorney-General of Russia should conduct a check to detect environmentally harmful activities.
In the lake area, he said, there were problems associated with the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental disturbances by recreational operators.
"I want to stress this: not everything in a row is to be verified, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities that need to be known, and to take appropriate action," he stressed.
The Office of the Attorney-General had previously reported a decrease in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of sites subject to environmental surveillance.
Recall that on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in a direct line, stated that there was a need to amend the law to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special security regime.
He was informed of problems in the management of business by the people of Olhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergey Donskaya, had immediately proposed a solution to the problem by clarifying the limits of the Baykal water protection area, but the Buratiy Government had recalled that such a change was not sufficient, since the restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, in the Ministry of Economics, a proposal was made to address the problem by amending the Land Code and the Law on the Protection of the Environment.
There will be a new temple in the South
In the village of Sosová, members of the community from the small indigenous peoples of the North, “Rahtniya”, together with the inhabitants of the Berezov district, are involved in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honour of the saint Nikolai the Miracle.
Its location is a river bank, and the temple will be well seen from afar, so it will serve as a traveling beacon for the fishers.
According to the community, the construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now in place, and church bells are in place.
The game fleet of the fleet provided transport escorts.
The temple is named after St. Nikolai the Wonderful, for he is regarded by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishers.
In Sosova, the fishing industry gives the settlers work and feeds them.
The locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and the children even write about it in school writings as local sights.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why Singapore’s Laws?
I'm talking to local businessman Chang, sitting in a diner in the open air.
In commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after the other, but carefully puts the cigarettes in an iron box taken from his office.
After the conversation is over, the businessman goes to the nearest urn, up to a hundred meters, and throws the bulls out.
A fine of 500 local dollars for garbage in a public place, reports Chang.
You know, I've had a reflex since I was a kid. You can't drop a candy fan off the bridge, you'll be fined instantly.
And now there's video cameras everywhere.
And indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the center of the city are clean, like a museum.
Chang tells us that three months ago, an 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine.
He was hit 10 times with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
We don't get a lot of corporal punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standards of living and the most severe laws, the observer of the AIF has been on the ground.
No one here is thinking of abominating the death penalty,” explains counsel Victor Lee Hong.
For a long time, the government has not cared about the views of both the EU and the US on this.
If a person transports or trades a lot of drugs, he will have a gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian was arrested at Changi Airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
It was defended by the Australian premiere, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope.
Still, the guy was hanged anyway.
After that, the drug couriers of our country are diligently traveling around the country.
The point is: Singapore requires that laws must respect everyone in a row, not just the lowly and the poor.
It doesn't matter if you're a millionaire, a vice-premier, a well-known artist or a member of the EU.
One option is, if you find a pound of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you're walking around Singapore, and you meet all kinds of warning signs, it's a simple wonder how many bans there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and it can be bought strictly by a doctor’s prescription (!).
The tourist will not be taken from the gum when he arrives, but if he puts a "roast" on the subway, he will be fined $1,000.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around my neck, "I was trashing."
In addition to the fine, the oxen thrown by the urn are often sentenced to a “port to the courtyards”: a week to clean up parks and beaches.
The “criminal” pays 6,000 roubles, who forgets to wash the water in the public toilet, and when an effort is made to make a small need in the elevator of the home, a special detector works, the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the most exotic laws is the ban on the feeding of pigeons on the street, the public singing of songs, and even the overpouring of a room plant (!), which is thought to attract mosquitoes.
In order to prevent fires, smokers are not allowed to carry lighters in the subway, or they will be fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
Anyway, the idea is, no matter how hard you try, you're gonna break something.
It's not like that, but it's trying to confuse me with Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of a local travel agency.
Special fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years I haven't seen anyone get involved for violating them.
Why do they stay?
So citizens don't relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let's say that if a minor is sold a cigarette in a kiosk, he will be punished in a chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge sum, the intruder himself will be hit with sticks on the back, and the seller will also be beaten and imprisoned.
It is because of such strict law that offences are very rare in Singapore.
Is that true?
Back in the 1970s, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored the traffic lights, drove as they please, got drunk behind the wheel.
After the year's fines, things calmed down.
Now the driver, who had had a shot of whiskey, knows that if they stop, the cop won't let go for bribes, he'll be fined at the cost of the apartment, and he'll be sent to jail for years.
For many foreigners, the city-state in South-East Asia appears to be a form of concentration camp.
In 1993 the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Death Island", a visitor from the United States of America, horrified the wealth of the people, "a frighteningly clean airport" and "cultural nature".
Discretion, such things are unnatural, they look artificial, and they don't have to be.
For the first days in Singapore, you're right to be afraid to drop the paper on the sidewalk, catching up on the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the Little India area, and all of a sudden, the "shatter of the template" is that the bus stop has plastic cups.
"How's that?" you wonder.
And like this, the Singaporeans smile.
Things happen.
Not every crime like that will get caught on the spot, but you need to know, if you get found out, you won't get cleaned up, because you broke the law.
More often than not, it's enough for a person to be normal.
Of course, power in Singapore is very authoritarian.
But you know what?
In the Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh, I traveled very carefully, and motorcyclists often extracted smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
Downtown Paris is full of filthy hobos and beggars.
Not everyone in our streets is trying to dump trash in the trash.
Singapore, however, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (until the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on Earth.
You'll think about it.
This is the human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was seated behind the wheel until the fines started.
Although Singapore's main point is not fines, it is voluntary law enforcement.
And you have to think that we in Russia, too, would enjoy the clean streets, the absence of garbage in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who mix the elevator with the public toilet.
Here's the corporal punishment - thank you, don't.
In the rest, Singapore's laws are at least worth looking at.
Nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Trump is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when it starts to fight the statues.
The Americans understand this as well as the rest of us - from here to the deliberate theatrical demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought the symbolic ax over the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president's proposals for a sharp reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue.
The men of pleasure boats and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would have lynched him if he had tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially of the point that was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument was finished, when Emma Lazarus's poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller groaned at Acosta, "I don't want to go deep in history, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you're talking about was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was right about the facts, but as he said, it's not really about history.
It's about the current sound of the astonishing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming of sighing free / the miserable waste of your vast shores."
"Unfortunate trash" has never been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature - he made it clear that in America Trump is not waiting for these people.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who fought to put her words in the back of the statues after her death - very well understood that they were committing a complete political act.
The sculpture was meant to indicate the link between the French and American republics by means of a banal classical figure, a female image of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And she got a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
Combining the poem and image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against American naiveism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right, though, changed it back.
Lucid Rush Limbo, a sort of John the Baptizer who had announced the arrival of Trump in 2010, reasoned that Freedom did not invite anyone, rather it was an early neoconservative carrying the flames of America lying in the darkness of the world: "Freedom is moving forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the US."
Against the usage of Limbo, it's really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the point of view.
Lazarus's great creative achievement was to see it as it was seen by exhausted, unhappy, but hopeful men on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and hospitality that they want to hear.
And, of course, that's not the prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch is not needed to light the way, but to stir up the hatred that is the only source of their power.
The 2017 World Cup: Neil Blake highly appreciates the Scottish members of the British team.
Aileed Doyle remembers a time when the British team had only two Scots.
Neil Blake, director of the United Kingdom Light Athletics Federation, said that a 16-member Scottish team at the World Cup would make a “important contribution to the team's game.
A record number of Scots' athletes was selected for the 2017 London Cup, which began on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland, “a special thing is being born” and that the Federation of Light Athletics of the United Kingdom should take that into account.
"We know that, and we're trying to figure it out, and we're going to keep it as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they think it has to do with what they did.
The Scottish Fédération of Light Athletics thinks that what they've done has to be done.
The British Light Athletics Federation: with what they've done, we have to work.
And the people on the street think the same thing.
I don't know why this is happening, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some of the Scots' athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Moe Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and Aileed Doyle has chosen the team to be his captain.
"Aileed is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"Many light-flyers, whether they're Scots or not, and wherever they live or train, left this room, feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Aylid had put in it were wonderful."
The owner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth Cup, who will run 400 meters in her fifth World Cup with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British team is "unthinkable."
The previous record for the world championship was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, specializing in the mid-distance race, scored five British and two European records last year.
She'll run 1500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who is going to be in the 1500 meters race, is another Scotsman who should be alerted: behind his back, he had a successful season in which the British team won the selections and the Annual Competitions.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when Lee McConnell was the only Scots member of the team.
The team captain says that she's "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but in some cases they'll claim medals and fight for the finals.
"The captain of the team chooses the other members of the team, so it was a huge honor anyway, but to know that your comrades voted for you and chose you - for me it's a very special thing," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all well-placed light-flyers, who will seek to reach the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it was good.
I just noticed that we're very lucky to have the World Cup home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we're gonna be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competition, and it's going to be a great atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't go to public office if you're not ready to listen to critics from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't shut his critics up.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "It is possible to take away the freedom of speech, and we, the deaf and the mute, will be led as sheep to slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subsidiaries blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union for the Defence of Civil Liberties sued him for it.
The governor's subsidiaries said that the suit was trivial, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "so and so."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people will say.
But it's important, too.
And that's particularly important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an incredibly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
He's ranked second among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is an unbridled reactionary.
He showed a firm hand in managing the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as the primary mode of communication with his constituents and shows his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking the people who come to the Governor's page -- which is said to be an official public forum and run by the administration on the money of the taxpayers -- is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, the Spokesman, Amelia Ches, defended the Governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments was just a way of moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers, and haters who are offending the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan's blocking.
And it's real people, not trolls, - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their chosen leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan to be a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Ramana, from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed at his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the section of the commentary to the article in the Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, "some people say it's a so-called twist instead of admitting that they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack," others might call a "active life-threatening position."
In the Facebook era, it is easy to sub-edit your image by simply blocking critics or obliterating negative comments.
This is a much less dusty job than it used to be, when it had to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical headlines, or arrest and shut the mouth of protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just in the figure.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who had been booked in his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this subject was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge of Alexandria, James C. Kesheris, the president of the Watching Board of the County of Laudon violated the First Amendment by knocking out the voter in her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevin filed a claim by the American Union for the Defence of Civil Liberties for his conduct on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's era of affordable postal spending, it was about the same revolution as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers had quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters had severely undermined its credibility.
Even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the aliases of Juricola, Valerius, Belizarius and Porcius wrote letters to the newspapers that mocked Washington's decision.
According to the historical documents collected by the George Washington online project, his office was overwhelmed by petitions criticizing his position under the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to keep them quiet.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech is at the very heart of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty's looking for comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who led the next door at the Archerfield Links Club, and was moving towards the final round last year, until he lost to Paul Ilse, was attached to the new site and served as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the club, Gerry Sarvadi.
“I've seen the Renaissance Club build, and we've seen it succeed with this event,” Rafferty said.
"The players will see this field at its best moment, it is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He's a strong supporter of this game and proud of his achievements here.
It's a great show for this field."
An Englishman Ilse looks forward to the opportunity to stand up for the first time, despite the fact that he won both the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a really special feeling," said a Southport player.
"I failed to try to win "Extremadura Open" again because it was removed from the calendar a year after I won it.
It's magic to return to this corner of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it."
He returns to fight in his home country, Gary Orr, who joined the European tournament for older athletes after he was 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 "Aberden Asset Management Scotish Open" tournament.
“When you play at home, it's always a bit more important,” said the resident of Helensborough Orr.
"You want to speak well, but you feel this extra burden."
I was very happy to play again, and I showed a good golf.
I'm content with the way it works so far."
This trio will be joined by the former winner of the Masters tournament, Ian Woosnem, and the senior majors' champions, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James, and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of the Reder Cup, Sam Torrance, two of the six Scots in the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair, and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free of charge, and the parking lot is 5 quid an hour if there's one person in the car, and 10 quid if there's two or more.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Typical tunnels over the highways, which can absorb car-exhausted carbon monoxide, are already being tested on British roads.
The country's transport agency, according to Autocor, reported positive results of tests on a 100-metre tunnel installed on a road in the north of the country.
A 6-metre-high tunnel is constructed of some recent polymeric material that can absorb the harmful substances contained in the car exhaust.
However, the creation of a whole network of tunnels like this is only part of the huge measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand the network of electric vehicle chargers, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, expand the use of commercial electric transport and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is related to transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the penalty for disabled Mamaev to a fine
Mosgorsud changed the penalty for the disabled Anton Mamaev, who had been sentenced to four and a half years in a colony, to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
This is reported by the TASS.
The Public Prosecutor's Office had previously requested the court to change the period of time to a conditional one, explaining its request to the effect that Mamaev's disease “is preventing him from being held in prison”.
The 28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general-regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former Special Forces combatant.
On 19 July, the court released the man from detention at a visiting hearing at the SIZO.
Poverty and death in Indonesian “Golden Land”
Bardin Deguei doesn't use the stove to cook lunch.
She doesn't even use a pot.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County, in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, the housewives usually just put the sweet potato, which is here called a note, in the hot spot.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken out and eats with impatient, unwashed hands.
The Degees are sitting on the ground floor -- she doesn't have any furniture -- and that's where she's doing her housework, like washing her woolly clothes out of a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
The multi-year life here is common.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk in the village after 5:00 p.m.,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was joined by Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote in public by raising their hands in front of the occupying forces.
The current movement for independence from the Netherlands had quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintained strict control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Anarotali is a city as remote as an abandoned city; the road includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapur, the provincial administrative center, to Nabeer, and a five-hour shake in a hired car.
There's no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of red-coloured shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners, have come here.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries, the pope had worshipped a god named Uga Tameo.
There have been other changes.
“We were unfavorable to wear these clothes,” Deguei tells us, pointing to his bright, hand-cold turban, dark skirt, and bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population live below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Pania, a high-rise province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport recovered about $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast forest reserves valued at $78 billion.
These riches, however, have led to one misfortune for the Popes, guaranteeing that the strong Indonesian armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the Popes threaten the existence of this golden vein and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in the native highlands of Papua in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Diocese, contains evidence of the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture – especially, as another report states, rape and electrocution – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is hard to count the number of victims, because the incidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harrison, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The guineas have been protracted, as Papua's resources have attracted the flow of resettlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3.5-million population of the province is 83 per cent Christian, but the demographics change as Muslim economic migrants from densely populated Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi – arrive.
Javan shops, “warungi”, sell fried chicken and a mix of gado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to stand up to the competition.
“Migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the natives of Papua,” explains Abeth Yo, a 25-year-old Paniai, who moved to Jayapur, the provincial capital, for work.
“This is why the natives of Papua, the mother-mother (female) of Papua, lost their marketplace.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, known as the Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the President's Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including the Paniai.
But there is little change in Papua, and the locals feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to live up to our hopes for justice,” Yoo says.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokowi Paniai suffered a tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street singing Christmas anthems at a fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the dark.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who had been drunk chased the children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, Julianus Emo 16, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to a government office nearby, and the next day the situation escalated.
About a thousand pope men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought their ritual hunting bows and performed the White, the popuasian pago dance, running in circles and playing the bird's song.
Some protesters began to throw stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation hit, the internal radio service was ordered to “if the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them,” it was said in an official document that was seen by Time magazine correspondents, but was not published in the local media.
The 50 - year - old Jeremias Cayama, head of the Kogo Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, I suddenly got hit in my left wrist," he told the magazine "TIME," standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kaime still doesn't know who shot him, but he says the bullet came from the shreng of the soldiers gathered.
"There was a crowd, there was a lot of shots," he adds.
A local resident of Alfius Jowa was shot three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, said.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johns, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, lamented the magazine Time.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotge Mende, Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, told reporters that his officers were just "protecting" their base because it was under attack.
“We must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us,” said the Papua Police Commissioner Pujo Sulistio in 2015.
“This is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and far more wounded.
The news of the murders didn't get to Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi gave a passionate speech in Jayapur expressing sympathies to the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately, never again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Viranto, said that he would set up a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately, the excuses went.
“Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s or at the beginning of the zero.
The fact is, we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed,” he said.
Then Viranto gave up his speech with the magazine "TIME" on 5 June in Jakarta, and said that he did not plan to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be decided by a court of law."
Viranto, whom the United Nations had accused of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the bloody East Timor independence vote in 1999, said that 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims in Pania met similar claims with grave distrust.
“In the last three years, I have been questioned four times, but there has been no change at all,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later, he's still living in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
“I'm afraid I'm going to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'm going to be shot.”
His brother Jacobus was also of the view that the inhabitants of Pania were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in the nearby Pania district of Deiya.
In a conflict between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help bring a man unconscious to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A 25-year-old man, Ravianos Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's construction site office.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded with warning shots.
But the locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed a man.
“We've been in such a panic, we're afraid of retaliation,” reported the magazine Time, a 29-year-old Domingue of Badia, who lives near the hospital and has seen the quick delivery of the wounded.
"I've been at home for two days."
The Deyai Parliament demanded that officers involved in the incident be called to account and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is a source of dissatisfaction among the tribes of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, which are spread throughout the green central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the “Movement for a Free Papua” (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pope by launching sporadic attacks and raids with kidnappings on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Pania, including Thadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Komia.
As a response, in recent years thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military under the guise of “Protection of national independence”.
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniai, it is considered “a sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases discontent.
A small quantity of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
The bread is, to the same extent, unavailable.
People here grow everything they eat, mostly a note, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubers are worth just 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic disparities between indigenous papuas and new migrants, who had come in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabir Airport, had increased.
Few existing vacancies are usually held by more educated and well-off migrants.
Papoeas rarely have the money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here,” says John Gobai, president of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the world's views.
In addition, restrictions on the international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basil Lonshan had been deported from Papua for “inconsistencies with the relevant organizations” despite the fact that they had been given rare permission to film.
According to Felim Keene, Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jokovi campaign to lift media restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been met.
“At present, foreign journalists trying to report from rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua face new dangers: visa denial and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands – requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diverse and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have backed OPM in the past.
A representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanata Nasir, reneged the group's statement, telling journalists in Jakarta that “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Netherlands Human Rights Ambassador, Kiis Van Ba ' aar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, the local people broke the silence, saying, “We want freedom,” as the source claims, who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the Popes say that they are unlikely to vote for the Jokowi again.
“Jockovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” says Gobai, president of the tribe council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, apart from living in the shadow of a threat from the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobay says that the Paniai, like the rest of the Papuas, consider their voice for the Jokowi, a debt that he must pay.
“They don't want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience, burying the body of one of the victims on the plot of land in front of the police and the military station.
Knowing that justice is likely never to be done, at least they will not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” says Jacobus without raising his head.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
The second fire covers the Tubian skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire covered one of the world's highest skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of people to leave the 75-story structure 337 meters high.
It's the second fire that went through the high-rise building – which is by toeval called the "Fakel" – in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up from the fire alarms and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” said Reuters, a skyscraper called George.
According to the Department of Civil Defence of the city of Dubai, fire brigades extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to victims.
The incident can bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in high-rise exteriors around the world.
In the course of the investigation by the Faquel administration after the fire in 2015, it was found that the most affected was the cries, the external panels used to decorate and insulate.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the cries of the Grenfell Tower building in London could have accelerated the spread of the fire that had taken place there in June, which had caused the death of some 80 people.
The growth in the Ida Viruma tourist industry in June was minimal
As can be seen from the data that the correspondent for the rus.err.ee portal received from the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists made use of hotel services in the Northeast, an increase of 125, or 0.6 per cent over the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists had declined and the number of foreign tourists had increased.
In June, for example, the international tour flow increased by 7.3% (544) to 7,994 tourists.
The number of local tourists declined by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The region has seen the most significant increase in the number of Russian tourists, by 8.9 per cent, or 318, since June 2016.
A total of 3,885 visitors from the Russian Federation stayed at the Ida Viruma Hotels in June 2017.
Andrey Malakhov let the fans know who was responsible for his departure.
Andrei Malakhov insinuated his fans at Instagram who was responsible for leaving Channel One.
So far, he has not commented on the rumours, but today he has posted a fragment of the August 1 article of the newspaper "Avoidances".
The picture Malakhov signed the "boss sucker" tag.
An article on how to prevent an employee from “burning out” and to pay attention to his or her condition.
Recall the numerous reports that the host was unable to find a common language with the new producer who had begun to reformulate "Let's Talk," it becomes clear what he so transparently insinuated, writes "CP".
Andrei Malakhov, a TV host, was reportedly currently on leave and had not signed an application for dismissal from Channel 1.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, a car bomb killed five soldiers
At least five soldiers died in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, transmitting the RIA News.
According to the police, a bomb exploded the night before the military roadblock in Girishk County.
We know about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new emergency took place in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the assailants and the security forces is continuing.
Daver shot the shark who bit his camera on video.
Dyver and a researcher, Greg Skomal, captured a video shark that bit his GoPro action camera.
Rolik posted on Facebook a unit of the American Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, a member of which is Scomal.
The incident took place on 2 August off the coast of the Cape Code Peninsula in the north-east of the United States, clarifying the Necn Portal.
The man tried to take the shark off the camera, which he held on a special stick.
When a man was spotted, an animal more than three meters long approached him.
The shark began to bite the camera, but did not try to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator did the same to determine whether the gadget was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also observed that the same behavior of a marine animal was new to scientists.
The cause of the mass fight in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military Region had come to the Yelan training centre, where a mass fight had taken place, to investigate the incident.
Some details of the attack have already come to light.
According to Mash, which appeared on the Vkontakte page, contractaries of U.S. military unit number 31612 had a brutal fight because of an unfilled bed.
It started with a private named Saiyan defying the officer's order to refill the sheet.
The officer was sided by soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young guys were beaten up in the barn of beds and sinks, and the glass was kicked out.
More than 10 people were injured in a mass fight.
The CSB denied the information on scissors.
The study found that at least one fifth of the U.S. passengers are transporting prohibited items on a plane.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of air travelers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items on board the plane through the U.S. Transport Security Administration ' s search points, including at least 6 per cent landing on the plane with illegal knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later found that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., covering over 1,000 people also showed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something that the ATB was not allowed to do, 19.7 per cent were milleniums, compared to less than 15 per cent of the X-generation.
The most conscious passage of food and water is by the ATB.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had been specifically inspecting sensitive items, while 2.2 per cent of the female respondents and 3.7 per cent of the male respondents admitted to knowingly carrying illicit drugs on the plane.
The company stated that it had studied passengers all over the country to find out how many of them had accidentally been smuggled through an airport search, and how many had done so knowingly.
It is well expected that most often, knowingly or unconsciously, smugglers are the ones who fly the most.
According to the company, the ATB rules are complex and complex.
People often don't know exactly what kind of liquids they can transport or how much.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what the ATB takes are banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought the ATB might consider it illegal to transport a book.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Prewitt rejects the intention to delay the implementation of Obama's emission reduction rules
The day after the 15-state claim, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency overturned his decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama rules to reduce air-polluting and smog-induced emissions.
Prueitt explained his decision by saying that his agency now listens more to the needs of state environmental regulators than to previous administrations.
He did not mention the claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute had taken place around the 1 October deadline by which the States should meet the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Prueitt announced that it would postpone compliance for one year to give its office more time to study the plan and to avoid “incompatibility with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Prewitt, who was the Attorney-General of Oklahoma before being appointed President Trump for his current position, was long known as a consistent adversary to the tightening of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, D.C., Puritt repeatedly blocked or postponed the imposition of rules that the chemical or gas oil industry opposed.
An unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal failure to return to the old standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had overstepped his power in an attempt to delay compliance with the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane spills.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by abruptly altering the course for ozone standards, he had simply complied with the obligation of the EPA to cooperate with the states in the integrated process of implementing the new standards in a timely manner.
“In previous EPA administrations, it was often impossible to meet the deadline, after which I was waiting for claims from activist groups and others, and to discuss the time frame in the course of the settlement of the case,” said Pruitt, who had filed more than a dozen claims against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take our statutes and the power that it gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that Prewitt may at some point again use his “deferral powers and other statutory powers” to make sure that the “jcyjdfys” rules are in a clear course and on all available information.
The Republicans in Congress are insisting on a wider revision of the ozone rules.
The Bill, which was approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone compliance with the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate had not yet voted on the matter.
The New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue the legal pressure.
"The evolution of the EPA course - after our lawsuits - is an important victory for health and security for 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who have been directly affected by the impact on their cities, "Sneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C.
The ground-level ozone occurs when normal pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources react to the atmosphere with sunlight.
This can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environment advocates welcomed the unexpected change in the course of Prueitt.
"It's hard to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from a man who's supposed to protect the air we're breathing," said Lori Ann Bird of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist Trump's ideological campaign and to protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
Congress IAAF extended the suspension of the All-Russia Light Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russia Light Athletics Federation (UFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF WFL Reconstitution Board, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be retained.
A total of 166 persons voted for the extension of the suspension, vs. 21, handing over the TASS.
The IAAF board report stated that the WFLA had made significant progress in achieving the conditions established by the re-membership board, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
As a result of the disqualification of the WFL at the London World Cup, Russian athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 members who were admitted to IAAF.
WFLA was permanently disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
At that time, the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Rund was published, in which he referred to numerous violations of the WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the last report of the IAAF board, see the IAAF extension of the WFL sanctions.
Reciprocation
In the context of the third round of the Fonbeth-First of Russia, the newoskovian "Chimick" played a field match against the FC "Caluga".
A little over 10 days ago, the rivals played in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was quite different.
The Chemiker did not give in to the opponent, but the second-hand relaxation at the end of the match led to an insulting goal and a failure.
After a recent defeat from the Calujans, with a score of 0.3, many prophesied in advance a simple victory for the masters.
Since the beginning of the meeting, however, the new Ukrainians have made themselves count and acted from the point of view of defence, but from the point of view of force.
In the first half of the time, the Calujans were more developed and had the advantage of owning the ball.
Another very good match was held by Alexei Syrotine, who repulsed several dangerous blows and gave his partners confidence in his actions.
Unfortunately, the Chemica attack lacked the effort and the luck to put the Kalugi's defenses at a standstill and to strike the first goal on the way out.
After the break, the game began to take place in a side-curriculum.
The New Scouts have been more active in the attack.
The alarming calls for our team were defense errors that allowed the Calucians to create a series of sharpening moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the reunion, the Chemic intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out a number of dangerous attacks.
But the Calais' experience played a role - they had a more literate and cooler end, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the Chemic moved the ball to the corner, the pitch of which the landowners, without resistance, were sent to the gates.
The goal was written by Yuri Dubrovin.
At the reporting meeting, the Chemiker showed a pretty good game, but he suffered an offended defeat.
Our team is awaiting another exit at 7 p.m. on 11 August in Moscow at the "Torpedo" Stadium of Edward Streltsov, the New Soviets, will fight the Favorite of the "Centre" FC "Ararat", which is composed of Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Izmaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come back to support "The Cheerios!"
The meeting place and time of the New Moscows is 6.30 p.m. outside the Magnolia store (East, D.2, Corp.
Chemica: Syrotin, Manohin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogya (Oreshkin), Doudaiti, Rizov, Saintov, Belyan (Adojevts), Andreychenko (Ligin)

According to published decryptions of the phone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico over the payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post published decryptions of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with the President of Mexico, Henrique Peña Nieta Trump insisted that he should stop publicly saying that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The U.S. president was banging him for his public speech against the wall, and according to what he said, he said to him, "You can't talk to the press."
Trump started his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was also deciphered by a violent altercation.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should accept the refugees on their way to Australia was “a funny,” “averse,” and “dumpy,” and insisted that, because of the agreement made by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop moving the refugees to the US.
Trump finished the conversation, telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant conversation of the day."
The bodies of the dead tourists in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
The plane, owned by the Russian Airlines, carrying the bodies of the dead Russians in Abkhazia, flew at 8:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, and handed over TASS.
At the point of departure, members of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the City Hall, will meet on board, and the Deputy Minister for resorts and tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba, will tell the reporters.
The representatives of the MES of the Republic had previously stated that all the costs associated with the return of the bodies to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay 500,000 roubles to the families of the victims.
According to Ahba, the Abkhaz authorities had expressed their willingness to pay the families of the victims of the bombings for travel and residence in the Republic, but the relatives had only sent to the Republic the power of trust to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On 2 August, at about 4:20 p.m. Moscow time, in the village of the Primorsky Goodout district, in the Ministry of Defence ' s missile-artillery armament depot, two explosions broke out, after which large-calibre shells and other ammunition were detonated.
As a result, the warehouse was set on fire, causing uncontrollable shell explosions of various modifications.
As a result of the crisis, two Russian citizens, Elena Polakov, born in 1970, and Elena Timothy, born in 1962, were killed on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to the health-care facilities of the Republic with varying degrees of injury.
There are currently seven people in the hospital, the rest of whom have been discharged.
A grand jury will study Russia's influence on American elections
The Special Prosecutor for Russia, Robert Müller, convened a grand jury in Washington to study Russia's impact on the US president's election in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to examine witnesses under oath.
The material collected will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether it is sufficient to bring charges.
The grand jury is giving Mueller extra power to collect testimony.
One of the subjects of the jury's investigation, which started a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son at the time of the candidate for president Donald Trump with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselničnica.
In June 2016, Mueller had already promised to check the details of the meeting.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his legal staff.
Trump Jr. told me that he had been waiting for a compromis on a candidate's headquarters from the Hillary Clinton Demparty, but no debating documents had been presented, and the subject was adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.'s statement of a meeting with Veselnitsky was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House said that the president was not dictating anything, but he was just using his authority, as any father would have done.
Vice Mayor Penza was detained at work.
The Deputy Chief of Administration of Penza, Irina Shirchina, was detained for 48 hours on the orders of the Investigation Committee at her place of work, reporting to the RIA News.
No official reports have been received from the law enforcement authorities in this regard, but the U.S. Press Service has assured the UK that they will follow soon.
There's no comment on what happened at Penza City.
Irina Shirchina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been in charge of urban planning and land relations since April 2015.
Prior to that, she had long worked as the head of the Department of the Department of the Department of the Ministry of the Interior of the Pensen Region.
Irina Shirshina is bringing up three minor children, and it is remarkable that once again as a mother a year ago, she gave up her maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, Mexico has no launch vehicle or launch vehicle.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bench is a tribute to the first person to have been in space.
In contrast to the monuments of the Soviet period that are being demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin are, on the contrary, “walking on the planet”.
In 2012, a monument was erected in American Houston near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument was erected in the Royal Observatory to mark the 50th anniversary of the first flight to space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovov Varach, Czech Republic, escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the centre of the city to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th birthday of Gagarin, a monument to Jurios Gagarinsu appeared in Riga.
That's the name and name of the first spaceman in Latin, and he looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: the activists will lose the Lynch Courts on stage to call for justice.
"Ford Mercury" in 1948 passed by the spectators in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and rushed roaring to the small Morse Ford Bridge.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, was approaching the bridge, a group of white men with rifles blocked the way.
The boss, a man of medium age in a suit in a thin strip, pulled a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Sitting inside trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man hurled.
"Get him out of the car!"
The piercing screams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Luckily, this horrible scene that took place on July 22 is just a mockery.
But when Roger was put on a loop around his neck, almost all the viewers really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night that the dolls lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm, and George and May Murray Dorsey, in 1946.
No one was convicted of the murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years no one has been arrested -- even though we see them next to us; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the show.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgia Congress, who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want an investigation, we want a conclusion, we want a cure, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We can't move on to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the lynching victims at the Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of having been involved in lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
While the suspects have been at large for decades, human rights defenders say that in the city the two linked motives of vigilantes, politics and sex, have always been well known.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court's ruling allowed for the first time black citizens to vote on the prime that was due to take place in the summer.
About the same election, according to the FBI, black user Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that according to rumours in the city, Hester was sleeping with his wife, Malcolm Dorothy, and that the baby she was supposed to have was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a big white landlord, paid $600 in bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of prison and got to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and directed the murders of Harrison," that is the conclusion of a report by the F.B.I.
"It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies, who not only took part in the murders, but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on the right to vote," he says.
"They've all been killed to send a signal to the blacks in the city: if you register and vote, you'll be the same."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene runs an annual show that reproduces that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her spectacle is observant, he's captivating the viewer, and he's talking about the deep racism that many would like to think is no longer in America.
It's hard to look at, and even harder to turn around, but Green thinks that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts, because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
The rehearsal of this year began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - gathered in the room and listened to the filthed view of the play over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Greene.
He's been a major member of the clan for a few years, but he says it's never made it any easier.
"I think I'm dirty because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story, because we don't want to go back at that time."
Indoors, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Ruscon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are repeating their roles.
Spectal begins with Malcolm, angered by the fact that Hester is sleeping with his wife, Dorothy, yelling and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Crying back to Ruscon.
There's a blow.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) is fascinated by a joke.
Green laughs louder than anyone.
"What is it," asks Ascon.
He's concerned and embarrassed.
Am I overreacting?
"No," says Greene through the laughter.
"I just don't think the white said nigga."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to say hard 'r'."
And so the energy in the room is changing: discomfort is changing the sense of partnership.
Everyone has to do the right thing, not just for the play, but for the memory of the four dead.
The scene starts over.
This time, when Ruscona speaks the word "n," it is clear and sharp.
No one's laughing.
The show ends brutally and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black dress stands over the body of the actor and performs a sad song by Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
A hundred yards away, half a dozen viewers are wiped out of their eyes with tears and sweat.
There's almost the same number of blacks and whites among the viewers.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to watch the show; many live very close.
They all endured Georgia's heavy perfume for almost eight hours while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
So far, the murder has been history, but now that they're standing in the same place that lynched people, it seems that their ghosts are in the air right now.
When the last note of the song is quiet, Greene invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
The children bend to their heads, touch the blood paint, and the motionless bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy murmuring, as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and all of a sudden it's over.
Actors drop strings off their necks and wipe out their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main doll.
Nick Ruscona hugs the other two actors, and suddenly, weeping, falls into their arms: the emotional strain of the show finally hit him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had a reason for that."
Later, the audience sits down for dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta lively discusses the performance with the black couple they just met.
Denisa Daplinski can barely find a word to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"I think the lynchings are still happening," she adds, "but now it's called what the police are shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender at the time of food.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"The plot is encouraging us, because it not only describes the horror of what we've been through, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not learn their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined Navalny for violations on the "Agitation Saturday"
The Simone Court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 roubles for violating the organization of the rally.
The opponent was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20.2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, “Recurrence of the organization of the rally”.
Previously, Judge Hizir Moussakaev of the Simonovsky Court of Moscow had finished the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the staff of the opposition, Alexei Navalny, who had been brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Wolkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Moussakayev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the “agitation Saturday” held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Upon seeing the agitated material, the officers who followed the Sabbath was of the view that the organizers of the event had deliberately concealed the true nature of the event, a public action (for which prior permission must be sought from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Anointev applied for the termination of the administrative proceedings due to the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had made some mistakes in the drafting of the record.
At the very “agitative Saturday” Volkoff was not detained, but he received a summons to appear at the police station to report on an event with his active participation.
The same subpoena was given to Navalny and another fellow oppositionist, Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordovia, a man who shot the bride and three wedding guests was arrested
The court in Mordovia arrested a local who had shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported to the National Bureau of the Investigation Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of July 29.
During the fight, a 42-year-old man in Saranska shot several times at the guests who had come to the village pond to take a bath.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been brought under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraph 2 (a), (a), (e), (and) (an attempt to kill two or more persons, committed in a manner of general danger, for hooliganism).
According to Interfax, the local media reported that the man had opened fire because the guests of the wedding had decided to take a bath in the area of his section to the water pond.
Minergo will tighten the requirements for turbine suppliers for power stations
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, hydroelectric turbines, oil transfer and oil production are launched, the equipment suppliers will be required to share access data with Minergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government decree is already ready for public discussion.
The new requirements will cover only the “critically important energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
The document identified potential threats such as the acquisition of information and access to the management of the site by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and entities, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The EU expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
On 4 August, the EU Press Service announced that the anti-Russian sanctions had been extended due to the Simens Turbines incident in Crimea.
This was previously reported by the "Arguments of the Week."
The EU Council Press Service stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been extended due to the Simens Turbines scandal, which had allegedly been taken to Crimea bypassing the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously reported that the final decision would be taken by the end of the day, and that the decision had been taken, and the sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Pearson shortens an extra 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, a British educational group, Pearson, announced that it would reduce an additional 3,000 jobs and reduce the advance dividend by 72 per cent in connection with the start of a new restructuring programme to address the problems that their business faces.
These job cuts, which, according to the head of the firm, John Fallon, will mostly take place at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs that were shortened during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it was planning to cut the cost by another 300 million pounds (US$ 394 million) in May under a third cost-cutting programme to try to get the business back to life, which had been hit by a rapid shift to digital learning.
Last month, the company, which agreed to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its annual forecasts remained unchanged after it announced an increase in sales of the main product by 1 per cent in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: a soldier, Nato, was killed by a suicide bomber
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding a number of others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to the NATO report.
According to unsubstantiated data from local sources, the incident in the town of Karabakh also resulted in the death of three civilians.
This explosion is the last of the massacres that struck Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people lost their lives in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion on the night of Thursday occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by a “human-transmitted improvised explosive device”.
All the wounded are reported to be in stable condition and to be treated at the United States Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
The correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is the main source of concern for NATO forces stationed in the vicinity of Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the suicide bombing caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed that they had launched the attack.
On May 31, a powerful explosion in the center of the city killed more than 150 people – the most serious human casualties in the country since the United States-led military had withdrawn the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence is accentuating the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether there is a need to increase the number of U.S. military forces that support the country’s troops and police.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its course of conduct, and particularly the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency, after legal action, overturns the decision to postpone the passage of the Air Pollution Act
The United States Environmental Protection Agency overturned the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama-era law, which requires states to limit air-polluting emissions one day after 15 states have sued the agency for that step.
On the evening of Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “Ozone 2015 measurements”, stressing that this step showed the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue and sensitivity with our partners in the states,” said the head of the Environment Agency, Scott Pruitt.
In June, Prüitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone the measurement of ozone at which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country in order to determine where to reduce it to meet more stringent air purity standards by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, along with the Federal District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit alleging that this intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental regulations introduced by the previous President Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme aimed, according to Trump, at shining economic growth.
But action in this direction has led to resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations, concerned about the possible impact of large-scale releases on public health.
The website of the Environmental Protection Agency states that the use of air for breath containing ozone “can worsen the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms,” for example, asthma.
The European Business Association has opposed new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with the US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
In the view of AEB, such measures can lead to a serious reduction in the production and number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be limited.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the EU and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon the heads of State and Government of the EU, the US, and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
The deputies ask the police to restrict traffic on the riverside in Pskov
The Pskov People ' s Choices sent a message to the head of the UMD on the city of Sergei Surin regarding the problem of movement along the Great River River.
Members of the Gorduma, Constantine Bolotin, Gregory of the Party, and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, driver control would help to make the area more secure and secure.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs of the “Footway” and drive freely on the shore.
This means that major repairs and improvements have been made in vain.
The sports and playgrounds are getting uncomfortable because of the cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, the central coastline is patrolled in the evenings by the PPP and the liners.
They make the number of motorized vehicles smaller, but do not stop.
Putin ordered the investigating authorities not to remove hard drives
Russia’s president, Vladimir Poetin, has proposed that the investigative authorities not be allowed to remove servers and hard drives from the company’s computer.
This was stated by the Head of State at the meeting on investment programmes in the Far East.
According to the President, “the application of measures leading to the suspension of business activities, including the removal of hard drives from computers and servers, should be excluded in the interest of the investigation”.
Putin noted that, if the investigators need to do so, “it is sufficient to remove the copies, to assure them and to use them in the course of the investigation”.
The Head of State added that “the conditions that hinder the continuation of the business up to the impossibility of paying taxes” should not be created.
Olga Bouzova told me how much she wanted to call her ex-husband.
Olga Bouzova, a TV talker, admitted that she wanted to call Dmitri Tarasov, her ex-husband.
At present, the celebrity is in the United States, where he works.
Just the day before Olga went to Las Vegas, she decided to publish a post on the Instagram social network.
She reported that she had not married, had not made any new tattoos, nor had she called her ex-husband to say that he had ruined her life, even though she was very eager to do so.
Bouzowa said she'd remember this trip forever, because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fage in filming a series of Harry Potter novels, died in 1992.
This was reported by the Independent on Thursday.
His family told him about the actor's death.
According to them, he lived “a huge life of success in film, theater and TV in 70 years of his career”.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, he played with Lawrence Olivier on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in "The Tragedy of Coriolane".
Hardy was also reminiscent of the repeated role of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the screenplays of the works of Agatha Christie about Miss Marple.
For his role in the BBC "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981), Churchill was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television (BAFTA) award.
Robert Hardy also had to act as US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on several occasions.
Something was rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with her crowning wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, it's a golden wedding, but on the agenda of a couple, it's not about getting ready for a party, it's about a rich argument.
His highness renounced the title of the Prince Consort, and he made a sin to the Queen that the Queen had never given him the title of the Consort King.
Henrik lives in France, although he is the official wife of the Queen.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia called on Washington to stop taunting Moscow
In the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Federation reacted to the statements of Mike Pens, who accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated by the foreign policy office some time ago.
In its comments, the MFA pointed out that the United States is increasingly using cold-war strains that are inadequate to the present-day reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the United States authorities to stop taunting the Russian Federation.
As "Arguments of the Week" wrote the day before, US Vice-President Mike Pens accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and to organize a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko are dating for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive match.
Vassili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be moving steadily towards the most exciting boxing match of up to £147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the office spaces of the ESPN in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unfailing Lightweight World Boxing Council Champion, went down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's second half-weight champion.
Following the unanimous victory of Garcia over the four-weight world champion, Erian Broner, on Saturday, on Showtime, both boxers are in the top five, regardless of the weights.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers were posing for the picture, manager Lomachenko Egis Clemas noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be very good.
"I used to be half-weighted, "remembered Garcia.
"I'm up for Broner's sake [up to £140], but I'm not that big.
I'm a little small for 140.
I want to get down to half the light.
And he needs to get up to half a pound [to £135], and then we'll have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's do it for them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boks needs this fight."
Climas asked if the fight should be aired through PPV, as part of the strategy that he is pursuing for Lomachenko to hold his debut match at a weight of 135 later this year to set up a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the world's lightweight champion in the arena of the Forum on 23 September.
“The fight may be at the PPV, because all the fans have asked for it,” said Garcia, expressing later a willingness to fight the channel that offers the best financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other name will bring such an interest.
As soon as they're ready... "
Garcia said that he considered Lomachenko to be a "frightening boxer" and that he might attend his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko didn't start to compliment Garcia right away, and he said that he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on showing the force of the strike, and then boxing.
They both said that they both felt the tension growing before their own fight.
“This fight must take place.
No other fight is so much of an interest and talk.
I am more than happy to work on it,' said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight."
In a few central streets, Moscow will be shut down for the weekend.
This weekend, on 5 and 6 August, the movement will be restricted in the capital on the section of Tver Street from the Nastasian alley to the Triumph Square, as well as on the 1st Tver-Yama Street.
In addition, the passage will be closed on the Leningrad Prospect, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tver-Yama Street.
At all sites, the overlap will operate on both lanes, as reported by the Transport Department information centre in Moscow.
The streets will be closed from midnight on 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August, due to improvements.
Also on weekends, traffic will be closed on the section of the Moscow River.
There's still the construction of the Charging Park.
Poetin asked the Attorney General to check on the Baikal.
The Russian President, Vladimir Poetin, instructed the Office of the Attorney-General of the Russian Federation to inspect the territory of Baikal for illegal and ecologically harmful activities.
“Request the Office of the Attorney-General to inspect the Baykal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities,” said Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested that action be taken if the facts of the violations were to be found.
New test results published to estimate the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden
Recent tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden, who had been subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, showed that over 80 per cent of the tests had been assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trusted the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age of asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, Migrationverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensics agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent of the tests (2002) were estimated to be 18 or over, and in 25 other cases the forensics agency estimated that the test was “probably 18 or over”.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “probably less than 18”.
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Guernsson of the Forensics Agency, the results correspond to those of the past months.
“We don't see much difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite the same,” he said to the “The Local” portal.
The high proportion of cases in which persons had been assessed as having reached the age of 18 did not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers had lied about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, “the nearest age of the test is 18 years or more.
However, after 581 of the published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person had openly declared that 18 of them had been in effect this year.
The method of performing a medical age assessment, which is to X-ray the tooths of wisdom and tomography of the knee joints and to give them to dentists and radiologists, has also led to criticism in some authorities.
One of the skeptics is endocrinologist from the Caroline Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess human biological maturity to determine whether they have experienced puberty earlier or later.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don't think we should use the methods of measurement that are currently in use.
The biological age is thus very imprecise.
If we can't define it with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can,' he said to the newspaper “Metro.
However, Göransen, from the forensics agency, expressed his preference for the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it is possible to say that the risk of a child being mistakenly accepted as an adult is small.
We face the greatest risk when a person is about to be 18, in which case it's about 10 percent.
I'll see if I can run for president.
During his work trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Poetin wanted to consider whether he would run for the presidency of Russia in 2018, handing over Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request made by the inhabitants of the village of Cheremushka of the region of Buryat.
During a video conference on the elimination of the fire in Buritia and Irkutsk oblast, the interviewer asked Putin to say, "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election comes, we all ask you to run for that office again."
"All right, I'll think about it, thank you," the president replied.
On 28 July, the Russian President's Spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, commented on some media statements that Vladimir Putin's election headquarters would be headed by the Chief of the Administration of the Russian Federation, Anton Wyno.
Sandov called these assumptions "nothing based on hypothetical reasoning."
"As long as there is no headquarters, until the establishment of the headquarters is far, far from the campaign," said Sandov.
"Until it's on the agenda," said Sandov.
The Governor of West Virginia said he was moving to another party
The Governor of West Virginia, the Democratic Party representative Jim Justice, announced on Thursday, during a rally with President Trump, that he was moving to another party.
“Do you like it or not, but the Democrats have drifted away from me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many reflections... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of any use to you as a Democrat Governor.”
The rally exploded with applause.
“So I will change my registration to a Republican tomorrow,” Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you that the time to play is different."
Trump had earlier promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with a 42-per-cent win, and Justice did not support the Democratic Party candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “The transfer of Governor Justice to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more of a hindrance than is working to make our country big again.”
“Taking into account only 15 governors and controlling the lowest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's statement is just another renunciation of a party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” reported CBS News, a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronn McDaniel.
Cat weights by the name of Mr. Beauty found the house thanks to social media.
A pet in Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat named Mr. Belle, who weighs over 14 kilos, after he became famous on the Internet.
This is reported by the Massable.
At the end of June, a picture of the cat was published on Facebook, asking him to find his owner, because "it was obviously someone who had fed him before."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of an animal's face could become a new meme.
The publication has attracted more than 3.2 thousand liquor and 15,000 comments.
In their comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to take Mr. Beauty's place.
As a result, it was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take over her weight.
In an interview with WNCN, an American woman said that she had had a similar experience: she had taken home a cat that weighs about 10 kilos, and now it weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
A post with an animal's picture has collected more than 68,000 views.
The commentators noted that she might well have made a career in the model business.
Coy lauded Russia's “honest” apology for the doping scandal
The international athletic expert Sebastian Coe praised on Thursday for what he called a sincere apology from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that this was not the time to allow the country to participate again in sporting events.
The Russian representative of the Light Athletics Federation, Dmitri Schlachtin, reported to the Congress of the International Association of Light Athletics, which was held on the eve of the World Cup in Light Athletics, that the removal of his country from sporting events was fair and that he was determined to combat doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals at the competition."
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations voted to retain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence of State-funded use of doping.
“I thought today's answer, today's report was very frank,” said the President of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations Coe to reporters.
“All the council and all the congresses loved... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has been going through very hot times and is now doing everything in its power to take care of the reconfiguration of the Federation.”
Koe said that he also “liked” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its restoration.
“I believe that it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that this is not the time to reinstate Russia,” Koe said.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to deal with this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate pure athletes from the stainted system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations, will take part under a neutral flag in the World Cup of Light Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met for Russia to recover.
As he reported to reporters in London, following a report to the International Association of Athletics Federations Council, drug testing is still not done in sufficient volume, and suspended coaches are still doing their job in a calm way.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason.
A journalist, Vasili Muravitski, who was detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SSA), has been placed under arrest for two months, handing over to the SSA.
A member of the Journal of Zhitomir is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
Russia, however, does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering it a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to make a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
A patrol ship, Commandant Borsini, entered the territorial waters of Libya to stop the flow of illegal migrants, together with the Navy of that country.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country ' s territory.
The opposing Cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobrook accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
And the Commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe those threats and that they intended to send another military vessel to the Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and head of the recognized European cabinet of Faiza Saraj.
The Italian authorities went to the establishment of a maritime mission to combat illegal migration, following the release in July of statistics on the number of illegals coming to the country from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
In the Government, resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
Scalable failure occurred in Skype
A global failure in Skype's service was recorded today in a number of countries around the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, the users began to send complaints to the program's developers.
Microsoft stressed that professionals are already actively working to address the problems faced by Europeans and North Americans, and the RIA “News”.
Let's recall that this June Skype also failed.
Users have been unable to receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the Ukrainian team in light athletics were suspended from participating in the CM
Olga Grounder and Olesha Powkh, specializing in short-distance races, have been excluded from the Ukrainian team for the World Cup 2017 in London.
This is reported on the website of the National Federation of Light Athletics (FLOW).
This decision was taken by the organization in connection with the initiation by the International Association of Light Athletics Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings against light-age children.
Trainer Sergey Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportsarena, the IAAF is suspected of using doping.
Pokh is the bronze prize of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Cup, the 2010 European Champion at the 4-100-metre relay, and the 2012 European Chieftainship at the 4-4-400-metre relay.
The London World Athletics Championship will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neimar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not interfere with the world record transfer of Neimar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris St. Germain.
Whatever the impact may be on the chain, the UEFA’s Paris Saint-German, a governing body that controls European football, in whose power it is to ban teams from participating in the prestigious championship League.
From the Financial Fairplay rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, it is clear that the SGW will eventually have to show that the Neimar transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million Euros ($262 million) to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Naymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
SGW can definitely make a lot of money to hire Neimar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the rich power of the ruling Qatari family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the cost-effectiveness threshold in their football business.
FFP introduced Michelle Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
A former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their quest for success had in fact cheated and risked ruin if banks or owners had stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on the debts of the clubs and instead shifted to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change in the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential, and then to spend a lot of money to improve the team and create a global brand – it became a difficult plan to implement.
For the current three-year period, the 2018 valuation can cost 30 million Euros.
And even though Platini was dishonorably removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
“It is possible that the FFP is alive, and as we move forward, we will tighten the rules,” said Andrea Traverso, a member of the Associated Press last week, who controls the FFP in UEFA.
Even though SGW will pay the buy-in of Neumar's contract on a one-time basis, he can distribute this amount for the duration of his contract.
Neumar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual accounts as a cost of 44.4 million euro over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on the SWF, as well as on the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
A fine of 60 million euro (at that rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to Euro20 million, was ordered to limit its team to the League of Champions during the 2014–1015 season to 21 players instead of normal 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by blowing up their revenues from companies associated with the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company might have been able to sponsor the SGG, if the amount of funding had been considered to be above the standard market rate, UEFA would have prevented it from being considered a legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the sum of the financing of the SWF from the Qatar Tourist Authority had been increased.
It was reported that a portion of Neumar's income from the SGW might have been paid by the 2022 World Cup Organizing Committee in Qatar.
But SGW and Qatar-2022 deny that Neimar will be an ambassador to the World Cup, and a similar manoeuvre could easily be discovered by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on the SWF mean that UEFA will be more closely following any attempt to bypass the rules.
On Thursday, people familiar with the situation reported that UEFA did not engage in a preliminary discussion with the SGW about the Neimar transfer.
They interacted with the Associated Press on an anonymous basis, as they were not authorised to discuss the situation of the SGW.
According to the most recent report, in 2015 - 1016 SGW earned more than 10 million Euros at a turnover of 542.4 million Euros.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
SGW expects that the arrival of Neimar will be a good ground for sponsorship, the sale of attributes, and T-shirts with the team logo.
At the club, it is assumed that the turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent as a result of the recruitment of a new player.
Undoubtedly angered by the departure of one of the best footballers, the Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Neimar, claiming that the SVU would violate the financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of “financial doping” with the club and the state,” said the Spanish newspaper “AS”, President La League Javier Tebas, in view of the fact that Qatar is the ultimate owner of the PSW.
Arsen Wenger, a coach in the Arsenal, whose club is owned by an American sports magnate, shares La League's doubts about the financing of the club by the state.
“These are all the consequences of sharing, and this has completely changed the landscape of football over the past 15 years,” said Wenger on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It's getting very hard to keep a financial fair play, because the country can have a lot of ways and a lot of reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The President will decide the order and place of the swearing-in.
Where and as new Russian citizens will swear their allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President will decide - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have drawn up a State Duma committee on legislation and Statehood.
A week ago, the deputies planned to make a direct determination of the procedure for swearing in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as those who are incapacitated, as follows from the amended text of the amendments to the draft law “On the nationality of the Russian Federation”, which the Committee will consider before the second reading on 11 July.
The idea of swearing an oath to become a national of the Russian Federation in place of the formal signature of the documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on 6 June in a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies drafted this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the annulment of the decision to grant citizenship to those who have subsequently been convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, public calls for terrorism or its public excuse in the media or on the Internet (art. 205.2, para. 2, of the Criminal Code), as well as the hijacking of a plane, train or water transport, but only if the act is linked to terrorism (art. 211, para. 4 of the Code).
According to the bill, his logic was as follows: by issuing citizenship documents, a person is bound by a promise to comply with Russian law - by taking the path of extremism, he is violating that promise.
The bill was submitted to the State in April by the leaders of the Duma factions, Vladimir Vasiliev (Union Russia), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (Just Russia) and the Speaker of the DG Viacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies adopted it on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State and Law approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but it has now been redrafted.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will set the order of the swearing-in.
Parliamentarians had previously intended to describe the procedure directly in the RF Citizenship Act, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the State stamp and the Russian flag in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event was to take place - a list of places where the Russian Federation ' s seal was possible - was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, the offices of the heads of State of the entities, the municipalities, the judges, the prosecutors, the heads of the federal executive, etc.
It's more likely to be a registrar.
The swearing of a solemn oath seeking Russian citizenship will be given after the officials have checked their documents.
But the Russian passport will not be given until after the swearing-in takes place, but it will follow from the refined text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in at the age of 18, not at the age of 14.
The rule that incapacitated or limited persons, as well as those who cannot deliver, read or sign the text of the oath by hand, will be maintained.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release from this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated bill also sets out a special procedure for the admission of citizens of Ukraine who are considered to be Russian speakers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an application to the competent body of Ukraine for that purpose.
A notarized copy of the application will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
Rejection of “alien” nationality, as it is, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the control of the person”.
An amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the First Vice-Speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Cologna, Pavel Krascheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all “One Russia”).
I think many of you know it's impossible to get a certificate from Ukraine, it's just impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting to decide their fate with regard to the citizenship of the Russian Federation, as explained the previous day by the head of the Domesian Committee on State and Law, Pavel Krachennikov (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that the restrictions on the holding of certain posts for foreigners would not apply to those who had in writing renounced “other” citizenship and had handed over the previous passport to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but had not ceased to be a national of another country “for reasons beyond its control”.
It is now prohibited for foreigners to hold positions in the municipal service, to be employed in facilities and in organizations whose activities are linked to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with a dual nationality or a residence permit in another country may not become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
The law was scheduled to enter into force on 1 September 2017, and the necessary by-laws should be in place by that time.
Nostalgia is becoming a niche in "America's Hot Fly" and "Detective Companion"
The current iteration of history is nostalgic in parallel to the glorious days of characters in the 1980s; the period of the grunge in the 1990s (sometimes at a time when outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Schovalter made a comedy of a sketchy "State" for MTV); and of themselves - that is, of 2001 - before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler, and Paul Rudd went to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
"The First Day of the Camp" was surprisingly good, and not just because of absurd humor (including the original story of the talking can of vegetables that H. John Benjamin sounded).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached the age of majority, making it a part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have been playing adults, have less profound emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystemic, and includes riffs from the 1990s' steel films like "Cradle Rocking Hands."
In one episode, the character extracts Apple Powerbook, four-wheel roller skates, and "a lot of other stuff from 1991".
A lot of plots are the same.
Good-natured Coop (Showalter), now a writer, has still not won any reciprocation from Cathy (Marguerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there's a crazy and mean plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Showalter) is involved, which is now instigated by George W. Bush, the Sr. (tested parade by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is to step away from it.
It's particularly funny to see a young Rudd who sings the song of Matt Dillon from "The One," a character of which, Andy's old man, is now an old man.
To make this franchise a success would be random madness in the spirit of a recursive show called Seven Up, until it reaches what I think would make it a logical conclusion: "The Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," where in the last scene the whole company would go to the movie premiere of "The Hot American Summer."
"Detective Companion" in the Amazon addresses another type of nostalgia: the memory of the Cold War of the Americans, the "Blond Explorer" or even the "Glass" with her images of the East-West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Director Reese Thomas, is a TV movie: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism, and the Marxist-Leninian way.
The main roles - the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are played by Florin Pierresick, Jr., and Cornelio Ulice, and their dialogues in English in Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Lewitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are a number of visual jokes (the police spend time watching the chess game, how Americans can watch football).
A group of famous voices in the frame, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahersala Ali and Chloe Sevigny, makes it possible to play "think the voice."
But "Comrade Detective" is holding on to the plausible clumsy propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are long, and it's funny not very often.
If it had been shortened, "Comrade Detective" could have better dealt with his satire in the spirit of agit prop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph went to the American embassy, there were two fat men in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
An imaginary communist viewer, this image says that Western culture is capable of obesity from anything.
The fictional Romanian writers of the film are not so wrong: we do this to our own recent history, and to them too.
The award for the Russian Super Bowl for football between Spartacus and Locomotive will be about 30 million roubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Prime League (FFL), Sergey Prukin, at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of the sum, RT reports.
He also added that, to date, there were almost no tickets left for the match.
The Spartacus-Locomotive match will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 9:30.
According to the TASS, Spartacus is the active champion of the Russian Federation, and the Locomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young occupiers cleaned the furniture for 200,000 roubles.
The other day, a 37-year-old Ufiman with a furniture firm approached the police.
The man claimed theft of expensive tools from the factory, causing serious damage to the production of the plant.
The miners were tools worth almost 200,000 roubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulic, a winch.
The guards of the order began to hunt down the criminals and soon came to the inhabitants of the Charity District of Bashcortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the collaborators entered the business, hacked the front door and removed the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen hardware to the first car service they found.
A case of theft had already been brought against them, and the law enforcement officers had been able to return only part of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
State Department commented on Medvedev's comments on the relations between the Russian Federation and the United States
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department, Heather Nauert, in response to Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev ' s statement on the relations of the two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government stated that, by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on those words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at “low levels”, but noted that “areas of interaction” should be sought.
"Look at the truce in the southwest of Syria, which has been in effect for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the US and Russia," quotes the diplomat RIA News.
At the same time, a representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the statement by the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions were tantamount to a trade war.
The new sanctions bill for Russia, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was signed by US President Donald Trump last Wednesday.
At the same time, he acknowledged that the document had failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "created" roses of amethysts and quartz
The jewellery unit of the French fancy house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - added to the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They had five new rings and three rings on velvet tapes.
In the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line, two new rings and a necklace of amethysts, pink quartz, and diamonds were produced in glyptics (hand-crying on stone) and passives to mark the 70th anniversary of the home.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by the roses growing in his estate in Granville by the modeler Christian Dior, and by the Paris gardens of Bagathel and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found the perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia
President Donald Trump of the United States made a strong criticism of the members of the Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"Can you thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president tweeted.
On the eve of the day, Donald Trump signed the law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently issued a statement by the President, in which he indicated that the law would not allow the US to make a lucrative deal and would bring the Russian Federation, China, and North Korea closer together.
A Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
A businessman from Belarus, Victor Prokopenya, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of a subsidiary of the Sberbank.
The businessman explained to RBC his intention to “concentrate on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
According to Mr. Prokopeni, this will be a “best investment of time” despite the investment attraction of buying the Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main bidder for a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank Consortium Gregory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guceriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Peter Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization, in addition to the TSA and the External Bank, became Sberbank.
Novak gave the reason for the blackout in Crimea
The reason for the blackout in Crimea was given at the Ministry of Energy.
Alexander Novak, the head of the department, made an explanation of the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was powerless due to an accident in the Krasnodar region.
A truck hit the power lines in the crash resulted in the shutdown of Cuban and related Crimea networks.
The power failure in the major Crimean cities was recorded last week.
The experts corrected the malfunction within a few hours.
Initially it was reported that blackout could be caused by an abnormal heat.
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have shattered rumours of possible increases.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain slow, and left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family income.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a score of 6 to 2 to keep the rate at 0.25 per cent, with a smaller number of members in favour of an increase this month, because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, and warned that the pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the fall.
The bank, however, warned that an increase in rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the crisis inflation, and said that it was likely that the cost of the loans would have to be raised more than expected in the financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the huge set of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of the crisis.
Beginning next February, the bank will close an urgent financing plan for which it provides banks with low-cost loans, even though it reported that it now has to provide an additional 15 billion pounds, up to 115 billion pounds, under the plan.
In the fee protocol, the bank said: “According to the MPC’s main forecasts, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) remains slow in the near future, while the pressure on real family incomes continues to affect consumption.”
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that a “severe tightening of financial policies” at a “severely greater” level than expected by the markets would be necessary to halt inflation.
At the moment, markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year, and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all the promotions would be “progressive” and “limited.”
The bank's upward projections for this year and the following year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank's forecast remained unchanged by 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After the news, the sterling fell relative to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and by 0.4 per cent to Euro1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after the recent discouraging growth rate weakened the increased expectation of an increase; GDP then rose by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the bank's representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to grow a little later in the year.
The bank’s last report on inflation gave little reason for the joy of the households that had been hit by high inflation and a very small increase in wages: the bank said that the pressure would increase before it fell.
The Bank added that financial policy “can't prevent” the pay-as-you-go in the next few years, but expects that wages will be “significantly” restored by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also determined to grow as a result of the growing demand for British goods, which is due to the low rate of the pound, which offsets part of the lower consumer spending.
The decision was taken a year after last August's rate was reduced to 0.25 per cent after the shocking results of the EU exit referendum, which led to a drop in the pound.
The bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's last decision on the rates, there was an upsurge in the scope of the proposed rate increases, as inflation was under increasing pressure on already under pressure households: three committee specialists asked to raise the rate to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that it had been expected to fall and that it was reimbursed in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate than the 2 per cent planned is entirely the result of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Coreco Mortgage Broker Company, said: “In view of the recent drop in Swap, it is likely that the mortgage market will again become even more competitive, as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end of the year.
The market is particularly favourable for those who are nearing the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing of credit, often with the possibility of the absence of a commission, as well as a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.
Public Health Service will prescribe a controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people
Beginning in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug to prevent HIV after the High Court's battle to finance the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure HIV (PREP), a pre-sex pill that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year trial period by about 10,000 people.
It agreed to finance the test after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court ' s decision last year, alleging that the National Health Service had an opportunity to pay for the PPE, despite her claim that it should be financed by the local authorities.
This step, which was announced on Thursday, was described as “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Office (NAT) called it a “turn point.”
Prior to the full launch of the program all over England, by April 2018, venereal dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to register, and more of them will join the program in October.
Pre-exposive prevention (PREP) is a pre-sex drug course to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PEI significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking pre-sex POPs in humans, there are enough specific drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for medication include gay and bisexual men, transgender men and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Disponents will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenderers and persons of whom partners are unknown whether their HIV status is limited by anti-retroviral therapy.
People who live and are assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for a potential participation in the nearest STD in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England has signed a drug contract this week after the international tender for purchase.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of the PEI by collecting clinical data on the target audience of the drug, its absorptiveness and its application on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and reinforce the wide-ranging and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the major health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of the NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The PEI, by properly targeting people who need help and are at risk, offers an opportunity to change the state of the HIV epidemic in England.
Beginning in September, people at risk in the field of HIV, thanks to a study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new opportunity that can be controlled by a person without having to discuss it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many or many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Greene, the president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first thing to do is to make sure that the test is quickly rolled around the country, and that no one at risk of HIV is forgotten.
Now that we have a pilot PPE, we're going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.
The Shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgson, said: “We very much welcome the start of the PEO test, which was very late because of months of delay and delay on the part of the government.”
The data show how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of the PEI.
Now it is important that the test be rolled up as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect those at risk of HIV and to move us one step further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
World Tatar Congress adopted a resolution on support for the Tatarstan and Russia treaties
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the office of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positive form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic, expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, it “played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
Recall that the agreement between Moscow and Kazanja was concluded for a period of 10 years, effective 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to keep the title of the seat of head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only member of the Federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one who's called the "president."
In Russia, it was difficult to get an international driver's license
GIEACPC units suffer from a shortage of international driving permits (IDPs).
In order to obtain such rights, we have to wait a few weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to travel abroad with their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains controversial.
IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written on the national certificate, as it was explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are set out in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are already recognized.
In fact, however, it depends on a specific police or rental office: some require an IDP, and some have national rights.
To be sure, drivers of international law do get, but it is worth bearing in mind that in non-ratification countries (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with the forms in almost all the units of the GIEACPC, reports Commersant, after conducting a study in a number of regions.
For example, in Moscow, the IGBD units have simply not issued tickets, and the forms have been short for four months.
You can make an appointment on the public service website, but the queue has already extended to mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is not possible to get the IDP "for technical reasons" without getting into the details, and in the Samara region it is fair to say that there are no forms, and the same is true in other cities.
Many Moscows have already faced the problem, and social media are becoming more frequent:
Irina Burmitrova: "Wait, why can't you get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because all of the HIELD offices ran out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question to people who know!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, it's always far ahead, and in the place of the ticket, the stamps don't give up at all (the button is there, but the ticket can't).
It looks like the public service portal shows that the Time Spb is free to shit.
Did anyone try to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for international driving permits have changed, so new forms are being delivered to the State Inspectorate.
This may be the case, but it is not clear what kind of change is involved, nor has it been previously reported.
The forms buy the Special Road Safety Centre (SSC) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then deliver them to the HIELD units.
In recent years, all the contracts have been awarded to the Goznák AO: in 2014 - 2015, almost 200,000 IDP forms were manufactured, in 2016 15,000 forms were purchased, in 2017 90,000, but the last contract was awarded to the First Printing Court on 18 July for the production of 70,000 forms.
There's a theory that the NPR just didn't make it in time for the tender, and that's why it's a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people have begun to travel to cheaper Asian countries, not to Europe, China, Thailand, and so on.
What rights are accepted there is not clear, so people are re-insuranced, so there is a huge demand for international “crusts”.
It has recently become clear that professional drivers will have to pass an examination to prove their qualifications.
Mintrans made this suggestion.
The new international driving permit (IDP) has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, 4 August, he said that in an interview with the Watcher's Portal.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or a bolt in it, because it runs the risk of losing its business in the EU, the US, and Japan, in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia on Crimea.
“I am deeply convinced that there is virtually no prospect of this project,” said Petrenko.
He added that Russia considered that it was unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot construct any smaller objects in a normal way.
I know that since the Sochi Olympics, whole stadiums have begun to break down.
“So I believe that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so short-sighted to join the project,” the official noted.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the car arch of the Crimean Bridge.
A large-scale assembly of the road arch of the Crimean Bridge has been completed on the Kerchen shore: it is closed at a height of 45 metres from the base of the structure.
“Anytime, the bridge planners have prepared a rail arch on the fairway supports”, reported at the project information centre.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport, Maxim Sokolov, informed the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, that the construction of the site was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula to the Krasnodar Region.
In Spain, an official who had not been to work for 10 years was fired
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the public service) should the head of the Spanish official, Carlos Recio, have?
The permanent hike lasted for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still dismissed.
But not by his direct boss.
Things that don't happen in the bureaucrat world.
The otters seem to be accustomed to all the "services of the people" a long time ago.
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, an archival officer in Valencia, Carles Resio, managed to stay away from work for ten years.
He received a regular salary.
And it's all solid, 50,000 euro a year.
And then Mr. Recio's "screw times" ended.
He was fired by a decision of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
In the investigation, it transpired that the hard-core loser had come to the office at 7:00 a.m. every morning to report to the electronics system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he showed up at 4:00 p.m. to report back to the system that he had left.
It's been 10 years.
It was also reported that all the free time the loser spent drawing comics at home.
The members of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia now wonder how to punish Mr. Recio's direct superior, who could not help but know how to work “actively” in his place of work.
Judges Offer protection from presidents
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC) has, on behalf of Vladimir Putin, developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC suggests that the powers of the presidents of the courts be limited and that they be elected.
For the Courts of Appeal and Cassation, the HRC wishes to introduce special districts that will not be linked to the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also present its proposals in the context of the presidential mandate.
The HRC has finalized proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the Council.
At a meeting with the Council on 8 December 2016, individual cases of arbitrariness were discussed, as well as problems of public control in places of detention (see OS, 9 December).
The work of the HRC has resulted in 25 proposals, which address both the issues of ensuring the independence of the judiciary and the identification of miscarriage of justice, as well as the financing of the courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders was to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts in order to enhance the independence of the rest of the judiciary.
If the candidate for the post of judge had successfully passed the competition and had received the support of the judicial community, the President of the Court, in the opinion of the Human Rights Council, should submit him for appointment without the right to refuse, as the law currently permitted.
It is also proposed that the President should not be allowed to distribute cases between the judges.
Doing it, experts say, can be a specially written computer program.
The HRC also considers that the president is not entitled to “predetermine the results of the judge's qualification, initiate disciplinary action, or make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the President's Council considers it necessary to move to “elect the presidents of the courts themselves” and to “power them for a relatively short period of time with a mandatory rotation”.
All presidents of the courts (republic to district) are now appointed by the President for a period of six years at the request of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect the judges from the pressure of the regional administrations, the HRC proposes to re-organize the appeal and cassation before the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC states that “there is a need to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized not at the level of the regional courts in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts”.
The experts are based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are “judiciary districts” that do not correspond to the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but thus guarantee greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty in using the “telephone law”.
The HRC ' s peace judges propose to be strengthened by the people ' s jurors to deal with some of the “classifications of civil and administrative cases” with them.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, reinstatement at work, protection of honour and dignity, denial of driver's license, etc.
“These are just our proposals,” explained the “OJ” member of the HRC, a retired judge of the Constitutional Court of Tamara Morsjakov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate concerned not only the HRC, but also the Supreme Court, which had not yet made its proposals public.
There is still time to carry out the task of the Navy (including the Office of the Attorney-General and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To inform Vladimir Poetin of the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the Russian Federation, the President of the Armed Forces, Viacheslav Swedev, is scheduled to report by 1 September.
To live a high life: half-storys and clever designs turned this little flat in Earls Court into a spacious home.
Joan Lee, a former banker interested in real-estate repairs, moved from a spacious home in Nightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The flat is on the ground floor of a pretty model home in the style of Queen Anne, and in favor of the new design says that Joan didn't pack her stuff and move again.
"I used to live with my ex-boyfriend in Knightsbridge on a much larger square," Joan tells me.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment at Earls Court, and there were also high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price the same day."
Since the first view, an apartment of 1,000 square feet has been refurbished.
Initially, it was an apartment with one bedroom of complex planning – to get to the bedroom, to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add space for the storage of stuff and half floors to extract the maximum benefit from the generous height of the ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my demand,' she said.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural design studio "Duck & Shed" to use the ceilings at 12.5 feet high and to create a home that would not only be a successful project, but would be for Joan to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to set up two spaces over one another, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-storey where you could stand in full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the breeze.
“Working with steel designs is very complex,” he explains.
“We had to place the premises so that they would be one over the other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was not just to construct a simple platform, but to bend the structure to the right height and allow the use of space from the top and bottom.
This decision enabled Erfan to set up two full-length rooms one over the other in the space, and a lot more interesting.
From the semi-storey through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" opens a view of the luxurious living room below.
Mirror furniture with gold finishes, silver accents, and vintage lighting from Serge Muy set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of spectacles, space, and light.
The short hallway is framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protection panel looks like a window to the other room.
At the entrance, the mirror closets are used to store all of Joan's dishes.
To create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new to the growing kitchens.
The unique thing about this kitchen is that it's a moving door up, like in the garage.
“The engineering was involved here,” Erfan tells us about the reinforced steel of a wooden-fibre shield door.
“It is equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily.”
Thanks to a reasonable use of storage space and space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom, and an improved layout.
“In the end, the area of the floors is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your property is worth,” Erfan says.
“Surely, the real estate agent will come in and make calculations on the basis of the sex area.”
Here, they have been able to expand the floor area by using quality materials that give space to the luxuries.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the home,” Erfan says.
“No one is in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't touch the strings of our hearts."
This shows that with good design and an extended metre, the flat can turn out to be something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of the Cultural Policy Commission
The Russian Government had approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The relevant decree is published on the Government's website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also draft cultural policy strategies, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for implementation.
The Head of the Commission is the Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, approved a plan to implement the State cultural policy strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and provides for measures to increase the impact of Russian culture in other countries and to preserve the common cultural space and cultural heritage, and will help to create conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries fell to a minimum of eight years
The rise in consumer prices in the G20 countries has fallen to the minimum in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that the inflation rate in June 2016 was 2 per cent - lower in October 2009, when the price index was 1.7 per cent.
Rossstat previously reported a drop of 0.1 per cent in the Russian consumer price index.
The agency thus recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
Inflation in Russia is calculated by the Ministry of Finance at 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economics, however, believes that the target figure has already been met - according to this agency, the figure is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against the illegal logging of the Baykal taiga
The Russian leader, Vladimir Poetin, warned at a meeting on the environmental development of natural Baykal territory against the illegal destruction of forests.
In the course of the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergey Donski, noted that a bill had previously been drafted.
It allows logging during the fires, and the government is planning to take it in the fall.
The President, in turn, said that the project should be kept under review to ensure that “not everything is shut down in a row”.
Donski noted that the bill involved control by the MES and the supervisory authorities.
Media: WSU fighters secretly negotiate with the Donbass militia
There is a regular telephone service in the area of the armed confrontation in Donbassa.
Fighters of the warring parties are always talking to each other on their cell phones, and they don't know about it at headquarters.
The U.S.F. and Donbassa militia have established their cell phones secretly from their high command.
On 4 August, Strana.ua reported this with reference to the military operation in Donbassa.
According to the publication, unit commanders know the names of their counterparts on the other side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
Communication is not a domestic one: the commanders are trying to reach some “tactical arrangements”.
Often, the result of such conversations is a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists have come to know of cases in which a member of the military has received his birthday greetings from his official enemy, because of the front line.
The WSW and the NDR and LNP have been sitting in trenches on the line of delimitation since spring 2014, when Ukraine began a combat operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has resented the blocking of U.N.S. Army statements about attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation.
In the Russian foreign policy department, the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives are outraged by the blocking of the U.N. statements in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Department recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus had been hit for the third time in a month by terrorist groups, Hiat Tahrir Al-Sham (former Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in the Russian Federation) and Falak Al-Rahman.
Taking into account that the international community is united in the characterization of Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council call for opposition to this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation noted that “it would be clear that the Nusra attacks should be universally condemned unconditionally and decisively, and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of the attacks against diplomatic missions”.
However, as the Department stressed, “for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council, alternating the tone of objections, concealing the alleged lack of information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft Security Council press statement condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should be left to those delegations.
“The most disturbing thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to engage in new provocations and terrorist acts, gives them a sense of impunity,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, and added, “wouldn't want these barbarians to have a belief that someone in the Security Council is with them.”
Vladimir Putin advocated limiting the number of unannounced business inspections
Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on investment projects in the Far East, said that the number of unplanned business inspections should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number of scheduled ones, and that the time limit for inspections should be limited to ten days.
“Unplanned checks are generally carried out without the appropriate agreement with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3 per cent is agreed with the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the rest is done on its own,” cites the President of TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should not be allowed to remove servers and hard drives from the business.
In addition, in the view of the President, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
“This will, I hope, make some positive progress in dealing with business-related cases or infringing the law in the area of business,” the Head of State said.
According to OS, the number of other types of business inspections is increasing as a result of the moratorium on scheduled inspections.
In May, a survey was commissioned by the Russian President, Boris Titov, to replace routine checks with unplanned tests (the share of which had risen from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), procuratorial tests (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raids (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and civil applications tests (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More details on the business tests in the "OJ" material, "The small business has come from the other side."
Brothers are fighting for a real estate empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest real-estate empires worth over $500 million - 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and the developer Colin de Lutis live at the Torak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him in the Supreme Court for the sharing of property and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in an intense dispute about the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna's brothers own 87 sites worth over half a billion dollars, purchased since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew up in a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's property list today includes office buildings, plots to be built in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Bank and Mount Bueller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late father, Colin - who Paul describes as the “primary engine and dominant person” of the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's property is 176 million.
The sharing of property and money was a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which Paul believes that Colin expelled him.
Colin claims it's not, but he's blaming Paul for incompetent management of some of the sites.
In the testimony given by Colin at the start of the trial, he said he was looking forward to a resolution of the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me think of the family as the top priority," he wrote.
The court costs are rising as a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and records of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both parties have engaged the most prominent lawyers, including Royal Advocate Allan Myers, and the best cooks.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they had run dairy bars and malls, and in the early 1970s they had bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last grade of the school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to hand over their property to their sons without conflict.
"Louisi often told me that he didn't want the brothers to be heard in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colin says Mark got 10 million when he left the business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark “were dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their office”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL Club's board of directors and, according to his 2015 biography, Eddie McGuire, the best friend of a TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered by texting that, since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing to say."
"I'm very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and lament the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin testified that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want to see Paul and I arguing in court," he said, adding, "still hope for a solution to the conflict."
This hope must have dissipated on Friday.
"The decision in our case will soon be delivered by the court," wrote Colleen.
The new head of Trump's office is planning to limit information to the president.
Others tried to do so and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
Then he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news outlets from the media, hoping to keep the Chief in a more secure state.
That's what reporter Josh Dozee says.
"At a meeting held by the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the management of the office on his first day of business, he identified the main problem in the White House of President Donald Trump, which he hopes to address: bad channels of information to the president."
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through it - paper or briefing - because the president's best decision-making is if he gets the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is absolutely correct, but others have failed in trying to keep Trump at bay by tracking the flow of information to him.
President Trump's relationship with TV developed a few decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had been given fair coverage in publications that might have been reconvinced," said "Politico" in February by Sam Nanberg, a former electoral counselor.
Tara Palmeri then wrote to "Politico" that "in the words of the six former members of the electoral headquarters, to control Trump's Twitter usage, it was necessary to make sure that the information that he received was a constant stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of tweeting was ever "under control" is funny.
Maybe these members of the electoral staff know something we don't know - for example, that if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets Trump didn't publish.
If his staff had saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts had not been in vain.
But no one ever managed to keep Trump from putting oil in the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material - secure or not - that confirms their views.
"Politico" - just about this story - wrote in May about the tendency of the councillors to keep the president in question.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Trump's current and former staff say that Trump can react very sharply to negative media reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone gave the president a copy of an article from GottNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the office, Katy Welsh, was accused of "standing behind the leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever banished on Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he didn't present any specific facts, or that in the past he started false accusations and then turned them down.
Trump read the article and started asking the staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that the then Chief of Staff Raines Prius and the Chief of Staff Rob Porter "were trying to build a system to manage and document the flow of paper that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same.
He may be a more efficient manager than Pribus, but Trump is still impulsive, and his associates are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Tumen Public Prosecutor's Office is fighting the HIV dissenting woman
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the ruling of the Kalininsky Rye Court of Tumeni, which had dropped the criminal case against a local woman who had died of HIV as a result of a minor.
According to the investigation, the child had died because the mother was a HIV-deficient and had refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of responsibility for reconciliation with her father.
The Public Prosecutor's Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished without setting a precedent for other HIV-indictees.
The case against a Tumenian woman was brought under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (death due to negligence) in April, following the death of her three-year-old daughter from HIV infection.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
“The woman was not treated herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection,” explained the Tumen district prosecutor's office.
The criminal case was brought to the Kalininsky Rye Court of Tumeni, which decided on 25 July to put an end to it.
The father of the dead girl made an application for this, explaining that “he has pardoned his wife, has no claim against her, has made up for the harm and has made an apology”.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office did not accept the court ' s decision and filed an appeal, requesting the annulment of the order to dismiss the case and refer it to a new hearing.
The girl died, and it is impossible to make amends for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the advice of the doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her against a dangerous infection,” reported to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In the view of the supervisory body, it must be punished, otherwise it will be followed by other HIV-dissenters.
According to the Tumen AIDS Center, there are now about 12 children living with HIV in the Tumen region who do not receive treatment due to parental failure.
"And this situation has already improved - in the year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV have changed their mind - allowed them to perform a diagnosis, started to take drugs," said the Spokesperson of the AIDS Center, Elena Loseva.
According to her, it was not possible to have a legal impact on parents, and as a result not all HIV-infected children were found, mothers were not allowed to examine them, to hide, to flee with children from hospitals.
The risk of HIV dissenters
At the end of last year, Peterburg sociologists presented the results of the first study of the so-called HIV-dissent movement in Russia.
HIV dissenters call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Health professionals and health-care activists in NCBs call such views anti-medical, and they are seen as a serious threat to the spread of such views.
A horrendous photo session, which ended in a tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Greek rail station in Khmelnitsk.
The cheerful company of drunken young men was walking over the railroad, where the freight train was standing.
One of the friends had an idea to make an imaginary selfie on the roof of the car, and told FACTAM in the Police Communications Branch in Khmelnitsk oblast.
The guy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion, he clinged to the power line and instantly got electrocuted.
Luckily, this incident was reported to the station controller, who immediately called an "emergency."
Prior to the arrival of the victim, the doctor was taken to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn section of the Hmelnitsk Regional Clinical Hospital.
The men were diagnosed with body burns of 1-2 degrees.
His condition is now assessed as stable.
Law enforcement officials recall that, in recent times, extreme selfies on rooftops, bridges, and transport have become more popular.
The police call on people to be vigilant and to prevent such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists allowed the oceans to exist in ancient Venus
In the ancient Venus, there might have been oceans.
That was the assumption made by French scientists.
The experts have developed a computer model that has demonstrated the formation of water on the planet's surface, by Science News.
It turns out that in Venus, at the beginning of its history, there were 10 percent more oceans than there was on Earth.
Previously, "Arguments of the Week" had written that, according to the scientific hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
In the course of their studies, foreign experts concluded that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured in a park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were shot dead, handing over the Assocated Press.
The incident took place in Dolores Park, with a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, a number of men on the bridge began to scream threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the intruders could not be seen, since they had all but their eyes closed.
Another medical care was provided, after which he was released.
The third wounded is a minor, no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park Hill is a popular place for locals and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured in a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
A number of other visitors had been injured trying to leave the premises.
Luna's rock band will present a new album at Barnaul
The Louna rock band concert will be held in Barnaul on 17 October.
The musicians will present their new album, "The Miracle New World", which is one of the most expected releases of the year.
The team is preparing a concept show, which will be the brightest in the band's concert history.
"The Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Luna.
Its name is linked to the famous novel-anti-opoia of O. Huxley's "O Wonderful New World."
New songs don't rewrite the book, but talk about a society that lives by the law of anti-Utopia, " blindly believing propaganda and imposed values."
The group was helped to collect the money for the album by the audience: more than 1,200 people supported the project on the website "Planet.ru".
Her first album, "Make Louder!", was released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the record "Time X", and in 2013 they recorded the album "We are the Luna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, the Luna band performed a symphony band at "Crocus City Hall" with the "Songs of Peace" program.
Lusine Gevorkian (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas-gitara), Ruben Kasaryan (gitara), Sergey Poncratev (gitara), Leonid Kinsburski (Arabs).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club "Pharaon" on October 17, at 7 p.m.
The price of tickets is between 1200 and 2600 roubles.
Luna is one of the required bands on the Russian rock scene.
The collection was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The band won a number of hits in the "Bitch Duty" charts on a number of occasions.
The gypsies overcame the trench and returned to the "millionaire street"
Some of the most affluent landlords in West Midland are again in conflict with the strong Roma who have overcame the trench that the municipal authorities have erected to re-enter the field next to their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla Street, which received the funny name "Millionaire Street".
With horses, infants, and lots of wheelhouses, they returned after being kicked out no more than in May, and they were not prevented by the moats dug by the municipal authorities to prevent them from invading.
This tactful company found a rift in the defence structures and shredded its vehicles through a section that left unsolved to leave space for the path.
Angry residents attacked the city of Solihal, saying that it was “unable to solve the problem.”
An anonymous local lady said, "They came here Monday night after being driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw rocks at passers-by."
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act, because it is not able to solve the problem.
The gypsies were here in May, and they were banished, and they came back again.
Last night, more gypsies arrived, and today perhaps even more.
“The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, and they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like the fact that I keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it.
A local man who wanted to stay anonymous said, "This is funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack is continuing."
This time, there were more, and we even saw a horse graze on the meadow."
A representative of the municipality of Solihalla said: “We know about the illegal camp on land near Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihall Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to get them out as soon as possible.”
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police on the phone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the New World Champagne Wine Plant.
The PCO of the Republic of Crimea, the “New World Champagne Plant”, has decided to take action by transforming the “New World Champagne Plant” into the OAO, following an order from the Minister of Property and Land Relations, Crimea Anna Anukhina.
100 per cent of the company's shares will remain in the state of Crimea.
The fixed capital of the equity company will be 595.5 million roubles, and will consist of 5.955 million shares of the nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Crimea, stated that if no funds were available for the upgrading of the plant in the next three years, the plant would be at risk of shutting down.
The cost of the plant's basics is between 60 and 70 per cent.
Modernization of the business requires 1.2 billion roubles. By virtue of the organizational and legal form, it is required to pay 50 per cent of the income to the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"It's hard to get money from the owner, to talk about the leverage of large credit organizations," said the head of the Crim's Memory Hotel Sergey Petelin last April.
The Crimea Parliament included the business in the privatization plan for 2017.
It was suggested that it should be held and tendered.
Interfax's source in Crimea's authorities estimated the possible value of the business's sales of $40 million, and the investor's investment in the modernization of the business at $30 million.
The New World in 2016 increased the production of game wine by 2.8 per cent over the 2015 level, to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The business was founded in 1878 by Prince Lion Golitsyn as a plant to produce a playful wine in the new world's property he acquired.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Suburban third graders destroyed more than 40 gravestones
Members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the district of Nizhgorod have identified the citizens who have demolished 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the town of Lyskovo.
Intruders turned out to be third-class students.
The first claim that the tombstones had been damaged by unknowns had been received by the Russian Federal Department of Internal Affairs in the Liskowski region as early as 27 June.
A total of 24 people contacted the police in this regard.
As a result, criminal proceedings have been instituted under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, “Destroying, damaging or desecrating grave sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, who were two school children aged 8 and 9.
Young offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing monuments fall, and that prompted them to commit hooliganism.
Preventive measures had been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone with respect to the ships of NGOs that save migrants.
Italy warned the NGOs that own rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new rules governing their operations.
“If NGOs fail to comply with the new code of conduct, it is hard to say whether they will be able to continue their activities,” said the Minister of the Interior, Mario Minniti, in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
A warning was given by Minnichi the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Retette, on the suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had worked for only a year, had declined to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Kartozio.
“For us, saving human life is and will remain the top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to work in the search and rescue zone,” states the organization's statement on social media.
"We will only be able to evaluate all the charges that have been made now after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been following the Juventa, a ship belonging to the Jugend Retette, since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken migrants on board by lifeboats, who had been sent directly to them by traffickers, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is expected to take place within 1.3 miles of the Libyan coastline, as stated in the prosecution file, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian shore authorities, which control rescue operations in the zone, more out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct presupposes, in the main, that the “Juventa”-type vessels will have a member of the Italian police who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have agreed to abide by the Code: Save the Children, the Maltese MOAS, and the Pro-Activa Open hugs from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules to be unnecessary, but acceptable, provided that they did not cause any “significant change or interference” with its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the Nobel Prize-winning MSF.
In the meantime, Minnichi said that the dramatic decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants coming to Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and co-operation with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict."
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently significantly intensified their policies in the Libyan direction, and delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have joined in their visits to Moscow.
The head of the Russian Contact Group for an Illiberian settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, Assistant Head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Degov, told us what the objectives of Moscow in the region are and on whom he puts his stake.
The contact group on Libya, which you are chairing, is almost unknown.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine -- everyone knows about it.
And here is a veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The Contact Group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
It is run by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mikhail Bogdanov, and Adam Delimhanov.
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State of Vyacheslav Volodin.
The reason for the formation of the group was the arrest in Libya of a Russian tanker, the Chebotarev Mechanic (in September 2015 there were 11 people on board).
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military experts, representatives of the State, was set up, and our work was supported by the Head of Chechnya, Ramzan Qadirov.
And how did you manage it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activities have not been limited to the release of sailors from Chebotarev's Mechanics.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government is based under Faiz Saraj. - "Oz") and to Tobrook (the branch of Parliament that opposes the Government and supports marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern part of Libya. - "Oz").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (the Libyan Vice-Prime Minister) we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make more effective use of those contacts, to set up a contact group.
Its mission is to analyse the situation, to identify key factors and players, and to engage with all parties to the conflict.
I want to stress that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict; we are engaged in a dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many are in Libya?
The contact group is now composed of five people.
Among them are people with experience in the security sector, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to include in the regional team the representatives of the Institute of the Middle East Rana.
There is no permanent presence of any of our staff in Libya, which is not yet necessary.
Is there any Russian military advisors, instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military professionals in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group includes the ex-military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
Like when we go to hot spots.
Or cities that have been closed to a certain point for us, such as Misurat (where militias are based, which have played a role in the overthrow of the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and which have significantly intensified in the years to come).
We arrived in Misurat in January this year.
We've been scared, told that there's a lot of Islamist, terrorist.
But it was important for us to take stock of the situation, analyse the real military potential, who is responsible, why such rumours are going on, what the real role of Islamists is.
In Misurat, we met with all the elements involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken away from the Russian-prohibited “Islamic State” - UO).
We wanted to see them, meet them, check out the information that they played a crucial role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, not the Khalifa Haftar, who attributed to himself.
And what is your conclusion?
"The Islamic State" in Libya won not Haftar?
He didn't do it.
Haftar had operations on the other front, in Benghazi.
And with the IG in Sirte, the structures under the government in Tripoli fought.
And by the way, we've invited to Russia the people who did this anti-terrorist operation.
And they came - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in Douma, MIDE, and Rosgwardia.
You, as we understand it, are found in all the Libyan regions, and you are probably imagining the sentiments of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has been the case many times in the past, the agreements will be shattered, the fighting will resume, the parties will try alone to take power?
The fact that Saraj and Haftar have agreed to another meeting has been a good signal to us, not long ago.
In the recent past, both leaders have been very negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
It is often said and written that Moscow is actively supporting the Haftara, and many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on the same day on board the Russian air carrier "Admiral Kuznetsov."
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurat, they didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is to show that we do not support only the Haftar, we are engaged in a dialogue with all the key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have been in touch.
Does understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level make it easier for him to go to the USSR twice?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
Russian, if he knows, it's very relative.
But the fact that he learned from us, of course, makes it easier to talk to him.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet the generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And now they speak Russian very well.
And they're reaching for Russia, and they're kind of nostalgic about it.
Do you consider it likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya will be lifted as soon as possible?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
Of course, but, as I said, we don't take sides in this conflict, and we don't want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in a similar position.
With regard to the arms embargo, there have been constant calls from the Libyans for Russia to help lift it.
The process of drafting a constitution is now under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromises, reach an internal consensus.
Then the election will take place, as was said at the Saraj and Haftara meetings.
If the elections are held and legitimate power is finally elected (and none of the parties now has that status), the question of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the UN Council.
To raise this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees coming from Libya, felt left behind by EU allies.
Can Moscow, in this situation, help Italian partners by using its ties to the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is it that the Haftar forces will take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers moving immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We're actively working on it.
The Italians need Russia's support because Moscow is conducting a dialogue at the same time with Haftar, Saraj, Misurat, and the south.
The tribes in southern Libya play a major role in this matter, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it a question of the south to stop the flow of migrants in long-distance?
So, by the way, they've been unrolling back the buses of Nigerian migrants?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope to help bring the South together in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes of the South.
But first, we would like to see a common view on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered to be an Islamist, a supporter of the establishment of sharia in the country.
How radical is he?
Would that not be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll tell you my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are part of his coalition.
Yes, but it is his own position that Libya must be a perfectly normal country - a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also active in the fight against terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It is created by those countries that do not want Russia to interact with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, and there is the legislature, the executive and the judiciary.
There's a national oil corporation, a national bank, and other public entities.
Of course, some countries wanted us to stay out of it.
And we mixed all the cards with them and started to interact actively with both Tripoli and Tobrook.
We are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosneft has entered into a cooperation agreement with the Libyan State Oil Company, NOC.
The Director of NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, made a deal, is directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess we'll re-sell.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
Plans to re-sign the contracts under Muammar Gaddafi.
These include, inter alia, previous transport agreements (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
So this is the oil-for-service scheme, as in the case of Iran?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't do that right now.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the most important.
We're actually doing peacekeeping work there.
For us, it is important to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to negotiate among themselves so that they can establish order, and Libya has ceased to be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, that is the main task to help the Libyan people and to get the terrorists out of there.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that, to date, no one from Russia or from other countries of the former USSR was there.
He said that he had about 50,000 phone records of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya - OS) and no Russian speech there.
And from what States, then, are these militants?
I don't want to go into that detail.
Then we'll put the question differently.
How many of the Islamic militants in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are virtually no Libyans among them, not more than 5 per cent.
The rest are incoming.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libish talks on the example of Paris?
There are plans for that.
We are engaged in intensive talks with the Libyans, a number of delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have offered to visit Moscow or Grozny again.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say right now.
A number of visits have yet to take place, and I hope that the time and place of the talks will be clear.
At the Czech Museum, charities raised money for a dear gift to a sick boy.
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Mazola, who has a DCP, brain hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a special runway on August 5th.
Sashe is the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, Oksana Kosareva, and the Director of the Museum, Constantine Bobkov.
The money for the training was collected during the Charity Marathon "Don't Get Tired of Doing Good", which was held in Melichov on July 15, on Chekov's Day of Remembrance.
On the eve of the museum's marathon, a letter was received from Sashi, who lives in the village of Manushino of the Czech region, saying, "I don't have eyes at all, so I asked my mom to write this letter."
"I'd love to get a runner to make my feet strong, and I'd learn to walk a little."
And then Sasha's dream came true!
After the performance in the museum, the concert postscriptum will be held, a well-known pianist, a well-deserved Russian artist, Alexander Gindin, will perform a purry of popular classical works.
During the Charity Marathon in Melihov, the Choir of the Oriental Dawid Desert, the callers of the Ilya Drozdichin workshop, the students of the Moscow Conservatory of the name P. I. Chaikovsky and the Russian Academy of the name of the Gnesin, and the artists of the Melchovsky Theatre of the "Chekhovsky Studio".
An auction was held for visitors, a book fair and a donation of souvenirs with a marathon logo.
The Melikhovo Museum took the initiative to make Chekov's Day of Remembrance a single day of charity in all museums in Moscow on 15 July.
A 30-year-old resident of the Olevsk oblast of Gitomir, near the local football stadium, shot several times at the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was aroused by the noise, and was told by FACTAM in the communication unit of the Gitomyr oblast police.
The man then entered a café nearby.
He had a conflict in the building, during which a man used rubber bullets to shoot off a visitor.
A 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care, and there was no threat to his life.
The police and the ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by then.
The law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a rubber bullet-shooting device that was sent to forensics.
In this connection, criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 296 of the Criminal Code.
The detainee is liable to 3 to 7 years ' imprisonment.
In Kyiv, there was a shooting attack in Lukyanovka near the street of Tatar on the night of July 28.
Michel Carter's conviction for the messages that led to Conrad Roy's suicide
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment for using text messages and phone calls to induce the suicide of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20, will have to serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five more years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the Thursday's hearing, "My family is sore.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She was facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy had mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing up, holding her hands and lowering her eyes.
"In her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She didn't accept responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monice said that in his view, her “age, maturity, or even mental illness did not have a significant effect on her actions”.
The Prosecutor read out the statements of Roy Lynn Roy's mother, which states: "It was not a day before I would not grieve for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I handle it - I'm trying to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will stay with us forever," he says.
Roy's sister, Camdin Roy, said that she was incessantly persecuting the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become an aunt of his children.
"Lieving the man who's always been with me since I was born is the pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would hold a person responsible for counseling a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of CO2 poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The incident drew the attention of the whole country when it became known that he had been induced to kill Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself, I don't know how many ways," she wrote in a number of messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before suicidal, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monice said that Carter wanted attention by means of Roy's death, and he barred her from talking to the press to keep her from getting what she wanted.
The legal opinion was divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder of her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
A 30-year-old Knox published in the Los Angeles Times her dissenting opinion, which stated, "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
"I let Langford go like a high-flying bird."
One of the best basketball players in the U.S. Single League, the 33-year-old Keith Langford, left UNIX.
The U.S. advocate's exit to the "Ivests" was commented on by the president of UNICS, Evgeny Bohachev.
Whale made this decision on family matters,' told Evgeny Bogachev.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I've decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played UNIX for three seasons, and in each match he scored a high, 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and his career as a player.
Keith Langford won the club for three years, winning the silver of the Unified League 2015/16.
In the 2016–17 season, he won the award to the most successful player in the Euroliga season.
He averaged 21.75 points per match.
This result is the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, was the second player in the history of the European League to win the award more than once.
Langford is about to sign a contract with the Chinese Chechen, informing Eurohoops.
The American is expected to enter into a 2-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second star of the European League in July to join the Chinese championship.
Previously on the Chinese CBA, Yannis Burusis had moved over the ex-centre of the Panatinaicos.
A sunburned tourist from Podskova was evacuated by a helicopter in Adigei
Today, Adieh rescuers evacuated from the mountainous area of the Republic a moscular tourist who had been hit with severe sunburn.
The man was resting at the Fish Home, at an altitude of 1,600 meters.
A 27-year-old tourist was under a lot of pressure as well as difficulty in breathing.
Pre-diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescue team was approached by the head of the tour team, who said that the man had been burned on a camping trip.
Audi is to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW announced that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 cars.
The president of BMW stated that the company believed that “there are more intelligent ways than limits on driving,” with reference to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – that considered the possibility of prohibiting or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler announced on Thursday that it was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their step a renunciation.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with CO2-emission regulations.
But nitrous oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automotive manufacturers of equipment that neutralizes the exhaust of diesel cars is also rising, and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, the government of chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of subjugating powerful automakers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the Folxwagen error, which concealed the use of so-called “default devices”, which, during testing, could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted to conform to the rules, and were shut down under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several leaders of Volkswagen have been convicted, and the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the Thermodynamics in Germany was arrested as part of the Audi engine development team.
Former manager, Zacheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian, and therefore unprotected from extradition, and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subjected to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities had accused Audi of installing a system to bypass European emission regulations and had expanded the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of “Audi” in the investigation may create serious problems for the Volkswagen: the producer of elite cars is the source of a disproportionate share of the income of the Volkswagen.
In Astrohani, a visitor to the café paid off his false money.
The police received a report from an employee at the bank office about the discovery of a suspicious sum of 5,000 roubles in the recalculation of money from the general service.
A study at the Forensics Centre showed that it was false.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the region of Astrakhan, the banknote was paid by one of the visitors to the café, who bought the saurma.
It is worth noting that the cashier was not equipped with an authentication device.
At present, the police have identified persons involved in the manufacture and marketing of a known forged Russian Federation CB ticket.
Such offences are punishable by up to 8 years ' imprisonment with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on the residents of the region of Astrakhan to pay attention to financial transactions; it is recommended that traders should install instruments to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a hellish planet where even iron can melt.
After first studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysics were greatly surprised by its temperature, which is evaporating iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so warmed up by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope has captured the shining of water molecules on this gas giant, which is the high temperature that causes the water in the planet's atmosphere to shine infrared.
WASP-121b refers to so-called hot Jupiters, gas giants, in size and mass, comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but tens of times closer to the parent star.
It only lasts a year on an exoplanet for 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas casing is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change is threatening the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but there is now concern that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become worse because of the dry weather and the insect-borne diseases; this has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the Provence Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM, said, "Lavanda in Provence is indeed at risk, because in recent years the plant has been experiencing the effects of climate change: in the spring, and especially in the fall, the rains are much smaller.
It affects the lifespan of the lavender.
And there are small cicades that jump over the leaves of insects that transport microbacteria; in very dry weather, there are a lot of them."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavendel not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very much needed in perfume and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, "Besides very long ears with a large number of big colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened, or no.
That's why we have less parts of the air oil."
The solutions currently under consideration include improved water distribution and slower evaporation from the soil, as well as plant spraying with a mix of clay and water, and more drought-resilient varieties.
Ambassador of the Winter University of 2019 met with Redyar students
Two-time world hockey champ, Ambassador of the 2019 Winter University, Alexander Semin met with the start-up hockey players the day before and gave autographs to the fans.
The meeting was held at the 2019 Winter University in the context of the theme week of the hike and puck.
Any visitor to the tent was able to skate on a site with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games were organized with a student play of souvenirs, and aerobics.
Fifty students participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible in sports playgrounds and stressed that the most important thing at the start of their studies was to work hard and to have a huge interest in hockey.
"Great, there's a platform in Krasnoyarsk like the Winter Universities 2019, where beginners can ask direct questions to the coaches of the teams," said the champ.
Note that ambassadors of the Winter University of 2019 help to promote student sports and healthy lifestyles among redheads.
The university's tent will work for the summer season until September 25, reporting to the Directory of the Winter University of 2019.
In the State Department, Medvedev's comments
The official representative of the US State Department, Heather Nauert, commenting at the briefing on the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, said that there was a need to find “areas of engagement” with Russia.
Such areas, she said, should be found to “improve the two-way interface”.
As an example of such successful cooperation, Nauert referred to the Armistice Agreement for Syria.
We are the two nuclear superpowers.
"And people all over the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
However, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev's claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, it certainly has the right to say, but I can't say anything more about it," said the representative of the State Department.
Previously, US President Donald Trump had signed a bill to tighten the sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the Head of Government of the Russian Federation, Medvedev, said that Washington had declared Moscow a full trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that US sanctions would be in effect for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister, the United States student, considered Trump's "clearly beat."
The man who went missing in Moscow was found at another man's house, lost his memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25, under very picky circumstances: he left the car's cabin to go to the bathroom.
Seven days later, he was unluckyly searched for by acquaintances and locals.
And there was Chamele at a stranger's house in Ramenski.
He was found completely naked by the owner in his toilet.
The Dagestan athlete failed to explain how he got here and what had happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
The identity was identified by the missing person's ads.
The callers recorded Hanmetov's partial memory loss and brain injury, reports the Massh public.
There are probably other surprises waiting for the athlete.
The intruders who kidnapped Chamele had probably already been to his apartment, the keys of which had also been stolen from him.
July oil revenues exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion roubles
The actual oil and gas revenues from July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, reports the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, the agency explains, was due mainly to a higher exchange rate of the United States dollar per ruble than the monthly average of June used for the valuation, as well as to the excess of actual gas production and the projected levels of oil exports.
“The deviation of the federal oil and gas revenues from the monthly valuation in line with the Federal Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected to be +40.2 billion roubles in August 2017,” says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Thus, the total amount spent on the purchase of foreign exchange on the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign exchange purchases will be equivalent to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign currency purchases by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.
Every working day during the said period, the CB will enter into foreign exchange purchases at the organized tenders of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the course of the day of trade.
The foreign currency acquired will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist underscores that Mexico is becoming more and more dangerous.
The weekly newspaper Riodos usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover recent violent crime in Sinaloa State related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them to the office where the grenade had already been thrown in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board in the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked the reporters to name each column - no evidence, no suspicions, no internal feelings will be enough.
They're drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a whole list of subversives that make it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
The violence has not given way to rest, and there are more and more journalists in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people have been under federal protection since the attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have lost their lives in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspirator, co-founder of the Riodos, Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Waldes wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is everywhere - a large picture of Valdes, displaying his middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" on the front of the Riodos building; two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smile, his face in his glasses, or his special panama.
The seminar is held less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office had been set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases had been investigated.
As in the case of most of the thousands of murders of drug trafficking and organized crime every year, journalists' killers are rarely brought to justice.
The Riodos press insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they have been killed in grief, even though it is much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from talking about security at the meetings, it is of little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
In the morning of May 15, Waldes left the office of Riodos in the capital of the state of Kuliakana.
He was only able to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "the 12th River."
The shooter drove off in his car and crashed it nearby.
Waldes was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to spread quickly over Kuliacán.
But there's almost no one talking about Waldes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the resulting vacuum.
Let us not say that one or more people are being killed every day in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is full of decorated double-story mausoleum drug kings, which is more than the home of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that the state of calm is just when one of the cartels takes control of the maritime state with important ports and drug routes in the United States.
Despite this, and the fact that Waldes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was devastated by guilt for failing to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder helped two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopez, the leader of a rival faction of the cartel, which is at war with the sons of Guzman.
The publication might have angered the sons; the people allegedly members of the gang had bought all the copies of the magazine as soon as they had been delivered to the kiosks.
The second error was that he did not force Waldes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper had been seized, which had been writing about the same story.
Waldes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, and his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Northeast, and in 2003 he founded the Riodos with five colleagues, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without the subject of drugs," said Bohorkes.
In time, the newspaper earned the reputation of a bold and honest publication, sales, and advertising.
The reporters liked that they could publish bold stories, not for fear of censor, but that the readers were drawn to read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its foundation, Riodos won the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Prize for Reporter's Work in Latin America.
In the same year, Waldes won the International Press Freedom Prize for Courage in the Mexico Drug Trade, wherever it went.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to move on," he said at the CPJ award.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is "this is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompepiento TV.
"You must accept the tasks that lie on you as a journalist - either that or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The staff of Riodos misses Valdes, a joker who's been fighting like a port porter, a friend who's generous with hugs and tips, a teacher who knows how to get together alive.
They relied on his order.
He was always supposed to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, a bar in front of the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, "He was destroyed by love for a single order?
His death led them to question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you know about their wives, their children, their legal business, and the underground airports for the transport of drugs.
"These things were out of line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay out of something that smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of Riodos, Andrés Villareal, is that "faith can be fooled... and then what happened to Javier."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer work in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions, and corrupt officials.
Landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodos had gathered for security training, it had suddenly been forbidden to bring cellular phones; a few days earlier it had become known that spying programmes, which were sold exclusively to Governments, were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
Outside, two policemen are hiding in the shadow of a tree from a temperature of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned to the state government to guard the office of Riodos, which is located in a four-story building in the Bourgeois district of Kuliakana.
Some half-joined journalists asked if the police were part of the 50 per cent of the law enforcement officers the Governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that was de facto under the control of drug gangs.
In the nearest issue of Riodos, it was expected to focus on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of the former boxing champ Julio César Chávez.
They also had to expose government spending, which was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Kuliacan, a block from the DA's office.
There was no official announcement of who was abducted or how it happened, so care had to be taken when the time had come to write that everyone in town knew that it was the favorite restaurant for drug dealers and the authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had dominated all levels of power for almost the last century.
A number of PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about the previous incidents at the restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Guzman had escaped the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for a column of Waldes with the most accurate information about the kidnapping.
"We'd already know what happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his skinny bodywork, called "El Flaco."
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources have been cut off."
Valdez's office is now being used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting against the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something they never thought to become: activists on behalf of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took a number of posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdés was killed.
Found the body burned, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
All over the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington trying to secure international support for the demand for justice in the Valdés case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez, she accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then requested that no more tasks be given to her to cover the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdés has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “circumcised” by organized crime, its partners in government, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Drug Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not being killed just by gangs of drug dealers; they do so on orders from politicians and security agencies in collusion with organized crime.
The Committee for the Defence of the Press, Articulo 19, considers that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on the orders of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
There was a note on her body supposedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her head cut off.
Some newspapers preferred to close as El North in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslava Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold out like El Manyana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez made a public address to drug cartels by means of an editorial on the first page entitled "What do you want us to do?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is hard to find a job in exile, and they still look out for danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as evidently happened to a photographer, Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work strike a daily balance between risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he's afraid to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, the publishers of Riodos sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when all of a sudden their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces close to the Masatlan resort had left, according to confirmed evidence, 19 dead.
The war continued to rage, as promised in a series of letters from the cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news via their cell phone to the Riodos website.
The next day, we had to redo the first page.
The sirens were picked up in the vicinity, another shoot-out in the area.
Bohorkes saw if the officers guarding them were ready for defense.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge picture of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was put on the lookout of all of Sinaloa, the staff of the Riodos continued his business.
"How can you think about shutting down," said Bohorkes, "if the day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her out to do a report?"
Dinosaur used the camouflage to avoid his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, although it is horrifying.
The researchers said that the first traces of an incredible creature the size of a rhino found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved that the experts called it "Mona Lisa among the Dinosauriers."
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his scalp skin was redish-brown – and to say that he had, in a way, a dark past.
In a report published in Modern Biology, it was described as “the most well-resisted Tyreophorus in its history of discovery and one of the best dinosaurs in the world”.
It is a fossil, a recently found copy of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the chalk period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly good state stunned the researchers, who call it “very remarkable.”
This plant-eating thyreophorus is the most well-preserved fossil of this kind in the history of the discovery, according to articles in National Geographic.
He was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Suncorn Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed to be different from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, an animal was found inside a ground depth of 2,500 feet (100 kg).
Now that all this hard work is done, the final result can be shown.
“It's just a little bit of a touch, and you can almost believe that he's sleeping,” said the lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrell Paleontology Museum, where the creature is shown.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs."
In a study of his skin, researchers found that it was a herbal, despite being covered with a shell and resembling a walking tank, and that it was likely to be in significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful shell-covered dinosaur used red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as a protective color, which is also used by many animals today.
This would make it possible for him to combine more quickly with the environment and avoid encountering his enemies, say the experts, assuming that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, which is 110 million years old, has been widely publicized in the press in May, and is currently on display at the Royal Tyrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and have given it the name of Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum lab, Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent over 7,000 hours digging it.
The remarkable preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and the shelling plates on his body.
They found a protective coloring, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the protective coloring is very common, the discovery became a surprise, because the size of the Dinosaurier Borealopelta is much greater than the size of the living animals with a protective coloring.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution chose to camouflage confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective colors – such as reindeer, zebra, or armored animals – are much smaller, and are a more accessible prey, which shows that nodozaur had had to struggle seriously for survival.
“The serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful shell-covered dinosaur shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Measles period were,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the shell of the dinosaur also shows that his skin was to be red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he sank and his back down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in the south of Florida, and the rivers and oceans are likely to spread farther into the land than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered by the remaining shaved skin, while at the same time being completely preserved in three dimensions, while preserving the original form of the animal,” said Brown.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it was then, in the early chalk period.
You don't have to use your imagination to recreate it a little bit, and you can almost believe that he's asleep.
The mellow period is an era in which giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Though the most remarkable of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his fearsome ancestors might have hunted a thyreophorus.
These include the acrocantosaurus, a monster with a length of 38 feet (1.5 m) and a weight of six tons.
Scientists, whose most recent discoveries are published in the magazine Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to the sea after his death and mummified in the sea.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, this is the world's most well-preserved thyreophorus, along with the skin and the shell, and it's intact, from the face to the femur.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (5 m) in length and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Their characteristic was the two 20-inch spikes coming out of their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herb - edible thyreophorus was a hard step in what is now Canada, until the spilled river took it to the high seas.
But the underwater grave of the dinosaur saved his shell to the nearest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular sample have been so well preserved that the skin remains still cover the bulwark pancircles along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for the magazine National Geographic, the degree of security is “several as a lottery win.”
The longer I look at it, the more astonishing it is.
Fossil fragments of skin still cover the bulwark pancreas that overwhelm the animal's skull.
His right foreleg is stretched along the side, with five fingers on it turned upside down.
I can count the scales on his sole."
Michael Saakashvili managed to get to Poland undocumented
Mikhail Saakashvili, who had previously led Georgia and then Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
In doing so, he did not have the documentation to prove his identity and nationality.
Saakashvili's arrival is reported by the Polish edition Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his performance on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili addressed an event to mark the anniversary of the Warsaw Revolt against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not speak Polish, even though he had tried to speak in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician referred to the topic of Georgia's cooperation with Poland, as well as to Ukraine.
That the Ukrainian Migration Service had stripped him of his citizenship, the opposing politician had learned from his time in the United States.
It is not yet known how he was able to make the transatlantic flight undocumented.
Previously, the former governor of Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, had stated that his signature on the application for Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not completed any forms.
The investigation of the Wynzeher and Olkhovik case has been extended until January
The pre-trial investigation of the co-owner of the Renova Group of Companies, Yevgeny Olkhovik, and the head of the T Plus Energy Holding, Boris Weinzeher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basmann Court is considering the extension of the accused ' s house arrest.
The representative of the UK, at the meeting, reported on the decision to extend the pretrial investigation for the last time.
“The particular complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need to remove and expertize a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations in the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation,” the investigator stated.
He added that the suspects regularly paid bribes to the management of Komi.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzeher, Olkhovik, as well as Mikhail Slobodin, the former head of the Integrated Power Systems, who led the company Vimpelcom until 5 September, have been handing over bribes to senior officials of the Republic of Komi for setting the most favourable rates for heat and electricity, as well as for creating a favourable business environment.
Winziher and Olkhovik were detained, staged in Siktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from the investigation and was reported to a federal search.
How did one activist know the answer to the question "Who Streets? "
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the depths of her heart.
Just a day after her arrival in New York, on a tourist trip to St. Louis, she sat on a bed in an apartment leased via Airbnb, gleaning the Facebook feed on her phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
After noting that none of her tapes had ever posted that information, which was puzzled, she closed off Facebook and Twitterd.
There was a lot of posting in her tape with the name @TheePharaoh.
A real-time rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's lifeless body, spread out in the street, where it would be for four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrel thought.
But death was not new to her and her circle.
She put off her phone, and later in the evening, she went back to the tweets that people were coming to Canfield Drive.
There were photos of signal tape and of people screaming and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who had a poster saying, "Ferguson policeman just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another cop, she said, pulled the trigger of a rifle and yelled, "I'll kill you all... animals!"
"This is a non-standard situation," said Ferrel, by his own memory.
“This is not a murder like the ones we're used to and can be described as typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and weeping."
She took a flight back and went home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years was the theme of a new documentary film, "Who Streets?", which will be released on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and perseverance from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was on her way to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of color, they remembered the conversation that had been held up to this morning countless times, “on the experience of blacks and their situation”.
She remembers saying, "Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now, because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong.
"I couldn't help but take it," said Ferrell later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She should know about it, see it, and be raised on it.
It must not only be well aware of activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black people's experience and status, and what we must do to become free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she will not face the obvious racism herself, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad favor if I had protected her from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made the first stop in South Florida Road, on a site across the street from a police station that had become a sort of tent camp, while the activists were waiting for reports of Officer Darren Wilson's final innocence.
There Ferrel and his daughter joined the local entrepreneur who made lunch packets.
They collected the packets and helped hand them out to protesters.
A little bit in Ferrell's mind took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism has completely changed since August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at Missouri-Saint-Louis University, she was the president of the Association of Health Students, National Minorities, and engaged in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
"I had no experience as a organizer.
It's come by itself."
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Foleyan, one of her co-directors.
Foleyan said that she and her main operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, “were just trying to document” the events.
Ferrel came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?"
This scepticism was engulfed by a large number of people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and endurance.
As Foleyan explained in a recent interview, “We have heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson do not get the center of attention, and we want to do it differently.”
By that time, Foleyan had joined with her co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the death penalty.
His participation raised sympathies for the project with Ferrel and with the six locals with whom the Team of the "Who Streets?" project had been in contact for years since Brown was killed.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we say it ourselves,” Davis said.
"It was the most important thing to me as these people will be represented, because it is how I will be represented."
Although the project was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience at all – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the patron leader, but about how the community is united,” as Foleyan said, it was the most open member of the film.
As a result, "Who Streets?" shows the unexpected personal aspects of Ferrel's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, laughing about the first time I saw a finished product.
"But I realized that when you do this job and humanize blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's history rediscusses and emphasizes the role of black gay women in the broader context of the Black Life.
Two of the three founders of the movement - the ones who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of the black teenager Treyvon Martin in 2012 - are considered to be homosexuals.
“Black gay women in leadership support this movement,” Ferrel says. “Because we're always fighting on a number of fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all this burden.”
Foleyan agreed with this claim, noting that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and a large number of gay black women”.
However, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrel was not selected as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the man who awakened this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she was at the top of the line, because when."
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, there are no cameras in Ferguson for a long time, but complex racial links between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell will be on probation for another two and a half years for blocking the road during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place that it calls home, just "Bardak."
She's still holding on to the talk she learned when she went out on the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualified for biting US players
The football team of El Salvador, Henry Romero, and Darwin Serene, received long-term disqualifications for unsportable behaviour.
During the quarter-fine match of the North American and Central American-Caribbean football confederation (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
First, Henry Romero's protector.
The Salvadoran bit the assailant Josie Altidor, then pinched him by the chest.
Serene, a mid-defendant, then bit Omar Gonzalez, a United States defender, when he applied an angle in his square.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and Serena for six.
The meeting itself ended with a victory for the Americans, with a score of 2:0, which is passed on to Goal.com.
There's a similarity: the artist is making portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA.
At the center of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York City, people's faces hang out from the ceiling on the wire -- white, black, and brown, all inconceivable.
These 30 portraits were made by the painter Heather Dewey-Harborg of the wang swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent clippings from Fort Levenworth, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was held on 2 August, is called "The Rise of Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, informatics, and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and a prominent dissident, who Barack Obama reduced her sentence just three days before the end of her presidency.
Analysing DNA from Manning's computer software and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of individuals who might have had such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a deep, though difficult, manifesto about not only the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of interpreting them and the ingenious determinization of these interpretations - but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born in the name of Bradley Edward, but was a teenager who openly claimed to be a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Spy Act, computer fraud, and theft.
Her picture in the prison was not available, so only one picture of her was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie, on which Manning, in a platinum shade of a wig, was clearly embarrassed to drive a car, and was associated with that picture.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed his 2012 project, Visions of Strangers.
In it, the painter made portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as smoking and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the trash and creating images of how those people might look.
And that's when she got an e-mail from the Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a picture to illustrate the article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a preliminary presentation of the new press exhibit.
At the time, Chelsea was not allowed to visit and take pictures, so they contacted her and asked her if she wanted to get a picture of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the painter and her prison muse became friends by letter and exchanged a number of letters for two years.
They even wrote a comic book, "Depressed Images," illustrated by Sholi Kanungo, who painted a picture of the president's future commuting Chelsea's punishment and his visit to the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama had really decided to free Manning just a few days after the book was released turned out to be a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and strong about the show opening up right now, when Donald Trump is declaring war to people who reveal secret information in the government, and inventing new ways to stir up the rivalry he's supposed to soften on Twitter.
When Dewey Harborg was asked about the timing of all this, she said, "Nothing happens."
In a statement by an artist on the wall of the gallery, Manning's huge signature at the bottom (with his heart over "i" in her name) calls for an end to the "automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the other hand, her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar from pencil C, G, and A.
Using 200 letters (or nucleotides as a scientifically elegant artist), Dewey Harborg was hoping to show how amazingly similar we all are, in any case, by our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open the genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Harborg; her 2007 video work "Fog Memory" is also here.
"The DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here."
The last part of the show in the same room is the novel in the comics mentioned above.
It shows Manning in the King Kong style over the United States Correctional Casars with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they'll win," it says.
"So don't ever shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says the artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I'm still freaking out when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the show in person - as it was visually pictured in comics - but when it arrives, it will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genome simulators, gathered like a crowd of protesters.
It's also premeditated, like everyone at the show up to height (5"2, Manning's height), where the pencil was painted with genetic helogroups.
"I'd rather put them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to look like a mass movement that shaped around Chelsea, like a movement that was standing behind her release."
A professor at Northwest University and a staff member at Oxford University is looking for the police on murder charges
According to the police, a national raid is under way on a professor at Northwest University and a staff member at Oxford University, who are wanted as suspects for having been found dead in a luxurious suite in Chicago.
According to the Cook County Court records, arrest warrants were issued on Monday for premeditated murder without the right to be released on bail from 40-year-old Wyndham Latham and 50-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the records, the 20-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after being subjected to multiple stab wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was found on July 27.
A call was made to the police, and they went to the Grand Plaza complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and the detectives are now investigating death by stab wounds, considering her to be a murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Latham was an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwest since 2007.
Alan C. Kabbage, the Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail application that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to go to Northwest University campuses.
“This is a criminal case that is being investigated by the authorized persons, and the University of Northwest cooperates with the investigation,” said Kabbaj.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
The University and Somerville College spoke in an e-mail statement: “We have been in contact with the British Police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. Investigators.”
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to give up.
The Chicago Police Chief of Communications, Anthony Gullelli, said that he strongly advises the suspect to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have any idea where they are, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” Guillemi reported.
According to Guillemi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Guillemi, the police called the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene terrible.
Guillemi reported that it was not clear whether the incident had taken place on 27 July.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Gullelli said.
The Grand Plasa Manual issued an address to the residents, which stated: “The police are currently working on a chronology of the incident, gathering information about the victim, and considering a number of reasons, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian vice-premier Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the road map of the VADA in the near future."
Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the operation of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would soon be met.
“A stage in the implementation of the requirements has been completed, and RUSADA has been authorized to plan and perform the tests in conjunction with the UKAD (Anti-Doping Agency of the United Kingdom).
The road map of the WADA was updated accordingly,' said Mutko on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the VADA road map on the restoration of compliance with the Code, which listed the conditions for the resumption of the work of RUSADA and had recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that might present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-ping structures should publicly accept the results of the VADA-ordered investigation of Canadian jurist Richard McLaren, who claimed that doping in Russian sport was controlled by the state.
On this issue, Mutko said, "We are investigating because our antidoping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there have been no government programs, and we will not accept what has not happened."
Mutko echoed the words of Vitaly Smyrnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of the Rsport, Smyrnov acknowledged the problems that had occurred in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report,' added Smyrnov.
WADA removed Rusada from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
In June this year, however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivier Niggley, stated that RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to re-establish its work.
Fire extinguished in the 79-story tower in Dubai
The big fire, which occurred in one of the world's highest residential buildings, the Torch Tower, was extinguished, is transmitting the Reuters.
It is noted that firefighters managed to handle all fires by 4 p.m. local time (3.00 msk).
The local authorities reported that no one was injured in the incident.
As the fire was extinguished, the streets surrounding the skyscraper were closed down.
The reasons for the incident are not yet known.
It was previously reported that the 79-story skyscraper The Torch, one of the highest buildings in the world, was on fire in Dubai.
All the tenants were evacuated in time.
The unimaginable outfit of the Boom shaken the fans: pants that don't cover the panties
Olga Bouzova, a candid reality host of the "House 2" show, struck the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with a dance in her underpants.
In front of thousands of fans, a new-found duet singer with Nastya Cudry performed the song "We're gonna be hot."
Both of the girls went out on the stage in a provocative "brooms," sewn in a way that showed up the underwear of the singers.
Buzova and Cudry were inscriptions on their pants.
In the past, it was reported that a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic had commented on the changes in the appearance of Bouzova.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
On Friday, 4 August, Radio 4 reported it to the news service, referring to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
However, Stoltenberg assured us that a dialogue with Russia was still possible, and that a further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of the participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that the US-Russia relationship was at a dangerously low level, and he blamed the US Congress for it.
The Yekaterinburg Metro is learning a new way of paying.
In October, it is possible to pay a bank card for a trip to the ekaterinburg subway, said the CEO of the UAO "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with the "Regional Gazette".
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same subway system as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, the guests of the uniform, to use the subway with their bank cards without getting badges or standing in line," he said.
Starts that will help your company not become another Uber
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the staff of her startup in the area of electronic commerce, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, untrue.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
“He has never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, the manager of a 75-person San Francisco-based company, “Madison Reed,” which deals with e-commerce in the area of hair management.
She therefore sought help from third parties.
A new kind of start-up in the area of staff is now emerging, helping companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that is designed to measure the involvement of staff members, they allow companies to make express interviews, to refer to certain teams and population groups, to offer staff anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and, in some cases, to allow informants to pass the top management and direct contact with the directorate.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?," says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glint startup in Redwood City, whose analytical programs are being used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Errett said that she had reached a better understanding of what her staff thought and felt in three years of Glint use.
In addition to the express polls and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers the company's heat map and shows which units have more complaints and which managers have a low rating of approval, which allows it to understand why.
The companies are somewhat aware of the need to control the workplace, or they will become the next Uber, who was involved in the scandal when a former employee posted a blog that described the aggressive environment in which those who had expressed discontent were punished.
For start-ups like "Glint", this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profit-making business.
The "Let's Talk About Pay" Internet Portal, dedicated to financial technology, estimates that the global governance, regulation and alignment industry may cost over $118.7 billion by 2020.
The "Convercent" start-up in Denver, Colorado, helping companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year, amid the loss of Uber's reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber has recently emerged as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send individual interviews of staff views, collect confidential answers in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages, which allows staff to report bad behaviour.
And if the top manager is involved, the complaints go straight to the office.
“The Court of Public Opinion has overtaken the powers of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is ill-treated or unethical, even if the inspector does not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of client boycotts, outflows and lawsuits, Queenlan reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, used Convercent for over a year to make sure that the staff were aware of the rules and procedures, and to suggest a simple way to contact the company's head office.
In the past, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for a telephone number or a head office e-mail, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a frightening and awkward experience, reported James Vitrano, the head of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to monitor staff complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convercent service, the problems that were previously hidden from managers in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, charisma, and unfair pay – can be quickly detected and addressed.
“I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of the staff,” said Vitrano, who manages the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“And we are protecting our shareholders from legal proceedings with the staff.”
According to Queenland, companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values, and involvement of employees in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed because of ethical irregularities as a result of Dela Enron.
But it was only when “social networks have become more common” that the companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from spreading the virus online.
“Before starting to use technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, charging companies regularly for the use of their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that won the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, "Convercent" received $10 million in funding from firms such as "Sapphire Ventures" and "Tola Capital", bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Besser Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than they did before.
In markets with strong competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages, and interesting projects, they are just the minimum necessary.
The employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are devoting their time to companies with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, they feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do is producing results, they are more committed to making such a company a success,” says Nina McQueen, the vice president of global benefits and satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors earn income when companies from their portfolio are doing well; business from companies is doing well when employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the commitment and engagement of staff, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to cultural professionals in the workplace, it is important to have data on the involvement of staff.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback, it can create the impression that change is coming.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or if it doesn't come at all, there may be frustration, and the staff will lose interest.
“If you're going to ask for 4,000 offers, you should be ready to hold 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rut, president of the management firm of Kotter International, who had to see companies make a mistake, relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will wonder, ‘Do you hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why don't I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which is currently conducting monthly interviews with staff, is in a position to take action on the same day that someone is reporting the problem with the help of Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from the staff, dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, it was able to restructure a number of teams within the company and introduce a communication training to solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is learning new things about its employees and hopes that in the long run it will be more effective in holding staff in an industry known for high turnover.
“If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose clients, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, they're opening a new asphalt on the Krasno-Armee Prospect.
Barnaul has taken radical steps to address the cause of the failure of the Asphalt on the Red Armean Prospect.
The place where the pits appeared twice on the newly-plotted carriageway (intersecting the Street of the Youth), it was decided to open up.
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road in the vicinity of the tramway was caused by the swelling of the land in the unsustainable area of the unsustainable network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Vice-Chairman of the City Committee on Road, Upgrading, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for a detailed survey and the elimination of the preconditions for collapse.
Depending on the results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the shell of unsustainable communications will need to be rebuilt and concreted.
This is reported on the official website of the capital.
The Breens team has to do longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day.
The time is approaching at 11:00 p.m.; a crowd of footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles is being held up to chat on one side of the team's new training field on campus.
Some of them pulled off their t-shirts, stripping their backs, shining from the sweat after the stressful first day of the sporting camp.
For many of the team's players, these moments of idleness are a break in the middle of the day.
Players in the summer classes, after three hours of training, will go back to the dorms to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Wasserman football center to meet at 6.30 p.m.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, the coach of the Bruins team, Jim Mora, said, "The next three days, these guys are waiting for a chopper."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled the training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on the players, actually extended their working day – at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
So the start of the first three trainings at the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled at 7:15 p.m. to fit in with the already dense player schedule.
A side effect of the absence of two trainings a day has been the number of days with one training, and Bruins is moving the start of the camp for almost a week from last year's and is training for the first time during summer school in six Seas in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 trainings up to and including August 20, before starting official preparations for the first game in the season against the Texas A&M team in September.
Maura said that he supported the change of rules by the National Students' Sports Association, despite the fact that it had created another point in the game's dense schedule.
"For three or four days, we're giving them this huge burden, it's a big test," said Maura.
"And they just overcame it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think that when we get to Saturday and have more time, it's gonna be really great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the training closed; this is not an easy task, since its fields are in direct view from the nearby parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, a dear hotel that has already been bombed by footballs that have overcame the security net outside the gate.
Players from Bruins should be in the hotel from this weekend, but Maura admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We're gonna have security," said Maura.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming that someone can rent a room, sit there and record the training in a video.
If you have a video of the training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security out there, and we'll have security in parking lot number eight.
We'll do what we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals
All the victims of the terrorist attack in the subway of St. Petersburg in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported to the vice-governor Anna Mithanina.
At the end of July, three people remained in the hospital, transmitting TV to the Centre.
To recall, the explosion in the metro station of St. Petersburg took place on April 3, this year.
The bomb was bombed by a suicide bomber, Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer of Abror Asimov, have been arrested.
Let us recall that the day before, Rosmesnadzor recommended that the Metropolitan of St. Petersburg review the transport security plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook reinforces fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send messages suspicious of mystifications to independent experts and to show their opinions under the original postings, and on Thursday, Facebook announced the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight the so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, to send them to the test, and possibly to show the results of the fact-checking under the source post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways to spread the so-called fake news, which, in the view of many, had an impact on the 2016 US presidential election.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters have been misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the September elections, they have expressed support for the plan to fine social media if they do not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook announced a test of the new fact-checking algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which messages are challenged by independent checkers, people want to have a broader context to make sound judgements about what they read and what they share," wrote Sarah Sue, the Facebook news manager.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "linked articles" and work on other changes in the news feed to address the problem of fake news.
Create a novel comic: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's small castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a shelter for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy spot in the Bayle River Valley in Kent County, he's been watching a turbulent history, and now he's inspired Jamie Rhoades, a yorkshire with a filthy hair, with a tendency to have a history, to a novel-comics.
"I think it's so beautiful - to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says.
"You feel it in person when you hold this letter in your hand."
The British Castle covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells of families who lived in Scotty; each story was illustrated by a young British artist, Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhoades, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "The Tooths of the Dead Man and Other Stories" - a collection of British Library records; this project suddenly touched him to the depths of his heart.
"I could have just been touched by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites," he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days the lights were on fire.
And in 300 years, in the future, you think you're there too.
Ah, I love archives!"
For a man so passionate about old papers, to get support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council, and to live in the castle for four months ("I've been there a little bit") seems too good to be true.
Rhoades spent all day studying the "new" Victorian castle, walking through the archives, and looking at numerous treasures of property and antiquities - for example, the heads of hyenas on walls or bottles that had been in the crest for centuries.
He was walking through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to the foresters, the gardeners, and sometimes the painters who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then at night, he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotty's castle is not well known, because the National Foundation only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassy, died.
When Rhoades arrived ten years later, the staff was just beginning to deal with the archive, which he described as "what the aristocrats had been on the attic for centuries."
The journals, the letters of the British Empire, the maps that show who owned what you think land disputes are boring, Rhoades says, but this is what two families fought for.
It happens, guys!"
In some of the history of the book, the castle becomes the starting point for the wider search in English history: for example, in "The Worker", the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Christian Revolution of 1381.
"There is evidence of a mutiny that took place at the castle in 1380, in a book called "The knightly families of Kent and Sussex," Rhoades says.
"The Crusade Revolt began in these places, and I thought the rebellion was a good start.
Maybe they were bound."
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle, for example, the "People of the Church", which tells us about the Jesuit priest that the Darryl family had been hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Smuggling" about an 18th-century smuggler, Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are the favorite family of Rhoades who lived in Scotty: "The Gentlemans seem to have been a perfect swindler, always in debt, and spend money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darryl men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I picture them as a company of handsome guys who know how to care for the heirs of big fortunes."
After finishing work at the castle, Rhoades is looking for other ways to get a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the countryside, where he wrote a graphic novel about Eliamyanmeaki, a place where the sanatorium was in the early 20th century, and then it was re-growing in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like, damn it, I have to get back to real life."
The top 15 banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank, and FC Open, another seven credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
As a result, no less than 80 per cent of the market will be shared by the retiring organizations of the ARB.
But this is not just an option - all the banks that have declared a break-up with the ARB are negotiating with another social organization that brings together credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks “Russia”, led by a well-known politician, Anatoli Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by way of fact, at the last session, and the most effective head of the Doum committee and deputy in the number of draft laws.
The conflict within the ARB was initiated during a debate in the Federation Council, when new draft laws were being considered by the Inter-Regional Banking Council, including the new classification of banks according to the size of the capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ARB, said that the association believed that the bill was being adopted for the benefit of the major banks, which were thus trying to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, in Tosunyan's view, did not always justify the withdrawal of licenses from some banks, which had, however, been objected to by the representative of the CBG: many of the managers of the bank, in particular the West Bank, had been part of the governing bodies of the ARB.
It appears that this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive way to the main regulator of the banking environment has become a visible reason for the 15 major banks to start preparing to join the association “Russia”, noting that “the effectiveness of the work of the ARB will be low and a constructive dialogue within the banking community is not in fact taking place”.
The Treasurers will be better
What's the end of this?
To answer the fundamental question that arises in the slightest bank failure or conflict or nearest to it, investors are not at risk, but rather the credibility of the banking system will be improved.
He is the head of Russia, Anatoly Aksakov, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank, who is known for his sensibilities in all matters of interest to banks and their clients: almost all the management of the CB is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert assessments of the “regions”.
In terms of human resources and organization, it is evident that there are no major shocks to be expected.
Undoubtedly, the ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation after the loss of such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, this oldest, established in 1991, has a significant potential to continue to improve banking law and the area of monetary treatment in general.
It is not possible to say that in Russia's open-ended association, they are ready to accept new members under any conditions, according to the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("may be too much to want"), who, as of 21 July, at a briefing to the Parliamentary Press Centre, said that “literally the next day, representatives of the banks that have left the ARB have asked me to consider the possibility of building up the potential of our association Russia”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of the bankers in the Association's Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process is under way, the proposals of both sides are being studied, and an agenda for an extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, to be held in Sochi in mid-September, as part of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Axakov, emphasizing that “the chair is not holding up,” called a possible new leader of the renovated association “Russia” by George Luntovsky, who is leaving the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, with a high profile of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crimea, is planning to interrupt his leave for one day and to arrive in Moscow at an extraordinary meeting of the Russia Association's Council, which is scheduled to consider the agenda for the “Russia Extraordinary Congress”.
The entry of petrol-powered cars to the major cities of Russia will not be restricted
The deputy head of the Ministry of Transport, Nikolai Asaul, said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-powered vehicles into the major cities of Russia would not be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually upgrade the environmental class.
And there's the concept to go straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, since when?
It's like this at the level of the slogans of the phrase - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Shall we shut the whole town down?
"In 20 years - I don't know, maybe that's gonna happen," quotes the Minister's "Prime."
In the past, the newspaper Izvestia reported that by 17 August, Vice-Premier Arcadia Dvorkovic had been instructed to study the proposals for possible options for the control of electric transport submitted to the Government by the CEO of PAO Kamaz, Sergey Koggin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, are the use of UXO-powered vehicles in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a Green Card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that a new US immigration plan would be adopted to change the rules for getting a Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work visas and restrictions on the granting of family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and are supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two Houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save the taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so by changing the way the US delivers Green Cards to the citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will give advantage to the English-speaking candidates, have the cash resources that enable them to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said, according to the American media.
The show of sex robots is real, and it should bother us.
Before we thought that 2017 could no longer get any worse, we had a new report on technological success in sex robots.
Yeah.
Sex robots are at the centre of attention right now.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5 to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharky, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and the co-founder of the FRR, we must take them seriously.
Users can choose the color of robot eyes, the shape of nipples, and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending it to their customers in a lot of numbers, and we're about to see a lot more of them," said Sharky at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable companions to robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human lines that are controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also “configur” their robots by choosing everything from the color of the eye and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the fingernails.
But the fact that a lot of robots have a "identity" in comparison to which the Stepford Wife would seem very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix Robot allows users to configure the quality that they find attractive in robots, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxy Gold sex robots that have been developed by "True Companion", which are supplied with an already programmed identity - for example, "Cold Farrah" seems shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "smart" character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that suits you perfectly," the website "True Companion" exults.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She's in a different mood during the day, like a real person!
She can want to sleep or talk, or she can be in the mood!
The emergence of sex robots is a cause for concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most worrying is the subjugated image of a woman, an association with rape, which is causing the takeover of the Cold (read, resisting) Farah.
On the "True Company" website, Roxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and growing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a shift from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex, subject to the option.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and while the HRR has noted their growing popularity, they are still on the margins of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are neither stupid nor aggressive until the free market gives them an opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complex sex robots have come about just when women's rights around the world are at risk, when the White House has a president who braggs about getting involved with women.
The worst thing in the TV series, "The Story of the Servant," is not graphic images, twisted bodies, and ejected eyes, namely, how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem so big.
The purpose of the sex robot industry is to make the physical likeness of real women (only with porn star ratios) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like humans to feel, to replicate the movements of the human body.
But it's the robots that don't look like real women with their "characters."
They cannot break up with or leave their partners.
They don't have a life or a biography -- nothing that might indicate independence or something that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, the maids.
A native of Los Angeles, Jeter, who has been a member of the Ukrainian team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
In an interview with the BeBasket Portal, the General Manager of the Blue-yellows, Andrey Swanev, reported this.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately he's not coming for family reasons.
We're going to the Eurobaset without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will make it possible for our young players to develop," he said.
With Jeter's direct participation, the Ukrainian team won the sixth highest in Europe Baskete 2013 and first won the World Basketball Championship, where the yellow-blue was unable to break the group stage, and the United States national averaged 15.4 points per game, 3 rebounds and 5 shows.
Jeter has ceased to stand for the Ukrainian team since he left the position of Chief Coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left the position in 2015.
Men's Eurobasket-2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Finland, Turkey, Romania, Israel and the United States.
The Ukrainian team will hold their band tournaments on the Earth as promised.
There will be five rivals in group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3 September), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control contests in which they gave way to the Dutch and the Belarusians.
Trump's grand feat?
It's very reasonable to pretend to be Mita Romney.
In the Trump era, it was common ground that the political disputes that polarized the American electorate had broken up some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the United States newspapers made columns on how to deal with the terrible families voting for Trump.
I think we're all so tense we're about to burst.
There's less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-handed poet from Chicago, who's been on knives with the Republicans in her family, was coming to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting in the fight against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including her Republican brother, with whom she had been arguing about politics for decades, was suddenly and bizarrely on the same side.
It's certainly good at dinner; but I can't help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed power into the left flank, but the deformative effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we're talking about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we're not gonna be hit by his actions.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who, in the context of its standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney today - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax application looks like) - compared to Trump and both seem very small evil.
When Trump is gone, the next Republican candidate will just be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department, and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the glass-fibre images on the central drum - the grinding clowns and the animals, who look in horror at their backs - are extremely ominous, and the ringing music is, strangely, thrilling.
So many of the famous things in this city are disappointing: the skyscrapers are getting old, the silhouettes of the buildings are getting too excited, and the reality of the city is not going to keep up with the dream.
Thirty-five years later, I'm still worried about the day I found out that the Suisse Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the "Ye Old Swiss Cottage" Thematic pub) but a big roundabout in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two, a child of 11 and two women in 40 can have a great time.
If I could put the carousel on the score, I'd put a five, but luckily, no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to evaluate my "experience" shopping on a scale of one to five stars before I had a card on the terminal.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same plus the option to keep the tips at 15 percent is for ordering at the counter.
As a result, not only is there a slowing down of neutral interaction, but there is also a need to make a personal connection to a situation that does not involve it.
The poor saleswoman in the store was in a bad mood to smile while I was tired of my five-star credit card experience.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain.
Pistory is leaving the prison for a second time.
Last year, he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of the cartilage cuts that the prison authorities claimed he had received as a result of the fall in the cell.
Pistoryus was convicted of wilful murder following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor's Office for an initial sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, shot her several times through the door of the toilet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistoryus said that he thought his girlfriend was a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated its intention to lodge another protest, this time against the six-year period of Pretoria, which it said was too mild.
The Office of the Attorney-General stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be heard this year.
Pretoria may be extended by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor's Office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in beating a NTW journalist is selected for a non-removal subscription.
Metropolitan law enforcement officials chose a restraining measure in the form of a non-removal note for a man who attacked a journalist at NTV news station Nikita Roszhaev during a live broadcast from Gorski Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irina Volk.
“In the context of the investigation of a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (“Bots”) against a 32-year-old man who struck the face of a correspondent of a TV station in the Central Park of Culture and Rest of the Name of Gorky, the suspect has been selected as a measure of restraint in the form of a non-exit and proper conduct,” stated the Wolf.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative record had been drawn up on the suspect for insubordination to the police.
On Wednesday, 2 August, a drunken man approached the correspondent during a live broadcast to the VDW Day and hit the face.
As it later turned out, the bully had nothing to do with the VDW.
On the contrary, according to Kozvan himself, the paratroopers tried to arrest Moscow.
Two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal tentage
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal tentage, according to BTV.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people were arrested in Sitonia, who had placed tents in an unpositioned place, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed BTW that Bulgarians had later been released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping and are already imposing severe fines on all those caught while parking in a place not in the same place.
The tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may order a fine.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia accused the US Vice-President of "cold-war" rhetoric.
The statements made during the European tour by US Vice-President Michael Pens were criticized by the Russian MID.
“Unfortunately, Washington is increasingly drifting to the primitive ideological strains of the Cold War, which are completely detached from reality,” states a statement by the Russian foreign policy department.
This is how the MID reacted to Pens's words about the “Russian threat” and the attempts he had made in Podgorica to break the borders by force.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed to the destructiveness of the choice of “or with the West or with Russia” and the invisibility of the hypothesis of the alleged non-alternative entry of all South-East Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the US that had violated international law by using force to remove Kosova from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“Inviting American colleagues to stop the silencing of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and a willingness to work together in a constructive manner, on mutual consideration of interests,” states the statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Feldsher was hit by an ambulance accident in Moscow.
The accident occurred in the Moscow Stupino, and a paramedics driver was hit by an inomarcus with the ambulance.
Today, about 8:10 a.m., a Mitsubishi car crashed with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance rolled over," said the TASS in the Press Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Moscow region.
There are law enforcement officers at the scene of the accident, and the circumstances are being investigated.
In Odessa, a woman threw her newborn son in the construction site, wrapping her in a plastic bag.
On the evening of 3 August, the Division's Police Department received a report from a local resident that he had found a bag of a baby in an unbuilt private home.
“At the scene of the incident, the law enforcement officers and the doctors, who promptly took the child to a medical institution,” reported to the Odessa Chief of the National Police.
The doctor determined that the boy was born a few hours before it was discovered, as evidenced by the navel.
A 36-year-old local woman was identified as a child at the time of the priority operational and investigative activities.
It is also established that a woman has three other young children.
As noted in the Head of State, the family had not previously been in the field of law enforcement, nor had it been placed on special account.
The police are currently identifying the circumstances and reasons that led the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of a doctor.
As previously reported, in Nikolayev, a 21-year-old woman had thrown her pre-mature child in the garbage pipe.
Gregory Leps: "I'm going to fight, though 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful artists in Russia, Gregory Leps, will be celebrating his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the event, the singer spoke to the Spectator.
I remember your "Potton" on the show.
Special tent in the Lunatics, Gloria Gainor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
I bet you were pretending to spend your next five-year-old.
Plans come true?
As far as the profession is concerned, it was a good time.
I've been working hard, traveling around the country three times, giving 120 to 130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what I was, say, 20 years ago.
Biology watches don't fool.
Singing as I sang at my 30s is getting harder.
Still, I'm going to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm getting to a different level.
That's where you're making the new album, the first in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it right now.
In fact, we've already recorded it in my studio, and now we're gonna send it to a subpoena in Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you so serious?" by the same name song that was written with Timati.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we make a video of it.
We'll present the album in November to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's "Crocus City Hall."
A cool American drummer, Chris Coleman, put his hand on your new record.
You seem to want to get him into your tour team, too?
In my view, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to see me at the studio, and he recorded his batches.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. - "Iceland" did.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put out, to say the least, superfluous conditions.
It was about royalties from Y35,000 to Y45,000 a month.
Then I thought I'd find some decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer, Max Baby.
In fact, it's best to feed your own (smile).
Sometimes I want to pick one of them up, not for anything.
For example, the guitarist Fedor Dossumov is highly quoted at the international level.
It's written by Western music magazines, and it's invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wye, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists, with another performing technique, had come."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the U.S.?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
I'm not doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with the matter.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get to America.
I've said a lot about it.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always had to do.
They wanted to make the best possible sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the United Kingdom has denied me entry for ten years.
But I'll still apply for a visa every year to the British Embassy to be allowed to go there again, and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me well.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a booked concert, but a poster, right?
Yeah, there's a good sporting hall in Monte Carlo, and I've been there once.
Now we've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the concert tickets have already been sold out.
To the "Randew of Lyme Wykule" which will start on July 20 in Jurmal, will you?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyme is a great singer and a great woman who can present herself with a beautiful voice, even a whisper.
After the tours and the jubilee concerts, as far as I know, it's the time you want to turn to the work of Vladimir Wissotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your disco.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be quite different.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of the High-Society in about the same show as he did.
Just the voice and the guitar.
There's no other arrangement.
I'll be accommodating our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I'll try to get Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to join the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see what happens.
You and Boris Gretchenkov's songs have been gradually injected into your repertoire.
Why don't you record his stuff later?
Boris Borisovich is a fine man and a great musician.
I ran into him a number of times, and I asked him, "Can I sing a song of his?
He said, "Grigory, I'm writing songs to perform."
Please try, sing.
I think it's interesting to write a record like that.
So far, I don't have a task like this, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might be doing a project like this.
If you don't focus completely on the business of your producer center.
I presume you haven't realized his potential yet, signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There's a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're self-contained people.
You mean Sergey Lazarus?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, and I invited him.
I might disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he's got his own development strategy.
And in my center, there is Alexander Panayotov, who I led in "The Voice."
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be a real pity if he did not reach the heights that he deserved.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm filming videos.
I hope it's a good result.
I'm also trying to promote other artists in my center: buy them songs, pay the poets, sometimes their tracks are in the rotation of TV and radio stations.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On their way out, they'll get a record album, a couple of clips.
And then, if they want to, they can go their own way, and I won't insist that they return their money.
Though I'd like one of them to make a commercial success and pay me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if it doesn't, I'm not gonna shut down the oxygen.
Let them all work, run, prove, as I used to prove.
If you're offered to make a tour of Ukraine tomorrow and guarantee entry to the country, will you?
I'm still being invited.
These are mostly closed events.
And as for the big tour...
I was a man of my country, a Russian, and I was convinced to fly to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If they say tomorrow they need to fly to some other place in the interest of the state, I will.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
It is my sincere regret that we have this situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we're the same people and we should be together.
I'm sorry it's not gonna work out anytime soon.
I used to give 40 to 50 concerts in Ukraine in a year.
We met like nowhere.
A very grateful public.
And with a number of Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorak, Light Loboda, Artem Loick...
There are a lot of talented people in Ukraine, and it is truly a pity that they are not in a position to put their talents fully out to a large Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I'd love to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, like Slava Wakarchuk, and make a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at this point...
Andrey Opskovov was moved from the cosmodrome
The Technical Director of the East Andrei Opacov Space Centre (SSC) began work at the State Space Science and Production Centre (SSC) of the name Chrunichev.
In the past, he had de facto been engaged in the construction of the East Space Station, but due to disagreements with the management of the Centre for the Exploitation of the Ground and Space Infrastructure (CENCI), he had been transferred to a business in the Moscow Fields to coordinate the production.
Mr. Opskov will not have a changer: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the function will be spread to the units of the Centre.
That the Technical Director of the East and the Deputy Director of the Centre for Technology Development, Andrey Opskov, had moved to work at Hrunichev's GKNPC, “OJ” was told by the top managers of a number of space industry enterprises, as well as by a member of the Government's office.
"He's been working at the new post for weeks," the "OOO" in the industry was clarified.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from the Centre on Thursday, and Mr. Opskov was not available for comment.
However, the "OJ" information was officially confirmed by the HCPCP.
He decided to take over the post of Director of the Coordination of Production, he said at the plant. " Andrey Opskov has fully fulfilled his task of providing a trigger minimum for the first launch at the East Space Station.
Mr. Opskov moved to work at the Centre in 2013 with his hands in space forces, particularly in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk, on the “north” cosmodrome, held the post of First Deputy Commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Opskov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of being bribed: allegedly, since his presentation, regional merchants had been paid for public orders, but had failed to fulfil their obligations to clean the segregated parts of the carrier rockets in the Archangel oblast and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its technological development responsibilities in the Centre for the Advancement of Women had been extended to various projects, but the main one had been the construction of a space station in the Far East.
The then-headed Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostenko, in an interview with the OS, explicitly said that the situation in the East "was critical as early as October 2013.
The fact is that the planning made a strategic error: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launcher was scheduled for the same time, at the end of 2015.
In order to complete the launch by the end of the year, the completion of the project was decided six months earlier and was rescheduled from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, the specialists of the Centre had begun to install the technology in parallel at uninstructed sites.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Opskov.
Despite the risks and the transport that took place (instead of December 2015 the Soyuz only left on April 28, 2016), this idea was justified, says the source of the "OO" in the cosmodrome: "We would still not have made any launches from the East, but would have built."
Vice-Premier Dmitry Rogozine, who is the manager of the launch site, jokedly called Andrei Opskov his "space susan" but he's the one who almost always asked for information about the progress of the project.
Mr. Opskov remembers and is direct: for example, in an interview with the "OO" he suggested that the Federal Special Construction Agency (Specstre) be removed from the status of the sole performer in the East and that we work directly with the sub-contractors, "Why do we have to put all the eggs in the same basket in the Special Structure?"
This idea was supported by the government.
Since 2017, the Centre has assumed the responsibility of a general contractor to complete the construction and construction works at the start-up and technical complex by the scheduled launches in the fourth quarter.
According to OS, the reason for Mr. Opackov's move to a new place of work was the disagreement with the management of the Centre on how to complete the construction of the complexes and the complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as how to work with the sub-contracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be the best for all," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
The government official, in turn, calls the decision a strange one: “He was one of the best professionals, it will be hard to find an equivalent replacement for him.”
According to OS, this will not be necessary: the post of the technical director of the space station will be abolished and its functions will be distributed to the units of the Centre.
There will be a two-professional programme in music schools
In the future, children ' s music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture of Saintoslav Bluenko, it is possible to re-read the repetitive disciplines for students, and the question of the payment of the rest of the studies in the second profession can be resolved by means of special grants to RIA News.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow for the training of two disciplines, but will not be inconsistent with the existing legislation in the field of education,” said Blueenko.
Last Friday, during the “Non-Childly Talk” by Vladimir Poetin with the students of the Sirius Children's Centre, a student, Maria Andreyeva, reported that she had to pay for a second specialty in the CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was in violin and piano class and that she had the award of competitions on both fronts.
The Head of State recognized the issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian was detained on the wall.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian named Kirill N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, reports the Al Universal Portal.
The incident took place in Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, climbed a 3-metre fence into the compound of the Nestle office buildings and himself climbed one of his towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or rope.
Got a young man on the roof.
Officials of the Ministry of Public Security landed him on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute for Migration.
They find out if the young man is lawfully present in the country.
In the meantime, videos of a young man climbing to the high ground have become popular on the Internet.
Users called the young man a Spider-Man.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help to make the WBC easier.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies suggest the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help to alleviate the symptoms of inflammable intestinal diseases.
It is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leading to a colicing and swelling of the abdomen, chronic or bloody diarrhea, loss of weight, and extreme fatigue.
Normally, in order to mitigate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid triptophan is contributing to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the intestine are making sure that no harm can be done to the intestines.
Cells capable of triggering an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too disrupted in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory intestinal diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacterium in their intestines have a growing cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs a triptophan, one of the building elements of the protein, to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between one type of bacteria, Lactobacilus reuteri, which is part of the normal intestinal microbiomy, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more the triptophan was in the mice's diet, the more these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work for humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a rich triptophan diet can lead to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation in the intestines.
Postdock Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, studying a variety of tolerant immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same line but was not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by microbial intestines - bacterial, viral, and fungi communities that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestine cells was sequented, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice with immune cells but not in mice without them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiomy and did not develop this kind of immune cell have L. reuteri, and they have immunized cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid environment, and then moved small portions of the liquid, free of bacteria, to the unsustainable immune cells separated from mice.
Immune cells have become more tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of triptophane processing, known as idol-3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophans in mice's food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of triptophane was halved, the number of cells also halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerant cell as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of the L. reuteri are contributing to the development of human cells, as are mice, but people with inflammable intestinal diseases have been found to be defective in the genes associated with the triptophan.
She says, "Perhaps we need to boost the development of these cells, because these cells affect inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines.
High levels of triptophan, if L. reuteri is present, can potentially lead to an expansion of their population. "
According to José Mourinho, Manchester United hired a “genia” in the face of Nemania Matich
Manchester United hired a "genia" in the face of Nemania Matich, who claims José Mourinho after a semi-defense debuted in a match against "Samporia" on the evening of Wednesday.
The player, purchased for £40 million from Chelsey, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season game of the UEFA Super Bowl against Real Madrid on Thursday, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira rushed forward when they wanted to.
However, since Matich did not take part in the pre-season tour of "Chelsey" in Asia, he was seriously short of preparation for the game, and he did not last 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires further development before the opening season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football,” said Mourinius.
"We'll help him get ready sooner than later."
Like Matich, his new partners, Victor Lindeloff and Romelu Luka, began the game at the Victoria Stadium, when Mourinho began to form his core by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
"I'm grateful to the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I'll be even more thrilled if they get me four out of four, but they've already done a lot for me."
The former leaders of the social Democrats of Lithuania persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition
The former presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, the ex-premier of Algirdas Butkjavicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Sejma Speaker of the Social Democrats of Cheslovas Jurchens, have appealed to the same party to stay in the ruling coalition.
According to the Parliamentary Gazette, a discussion has been initiated in the Social Democratic Party on whether to stay in the ruling coalition due to tensions with partners - the Union of Farmers and Greens.
The three senior experienced comrades wrote to the same party with an open letter, which states, inter alia: “The disappointment of the party's partners in the results of the elections is understandable, but the coalition with the “crusades” has created conditions for us to continue to pursue the social justice goals that we have set out in the Government's programme and to maintain the political dominance of the left centre over the right parties.”
In the view of the former party leaders, the debate has so far “began with emotional expression without specific argument”.
The authors of the letter fear that their party's reckless actions may lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
The disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
Mosgorsud reduced the penalty for disabled carrier Anton Mamaev from four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
The convicted person had previously been released from the SIZO by a decision of the Tymirezev Court.
At the same time, Mosgorsoud confirmed that the accused was a criminal, as he had arranged for the robbery and abduction of a motoraller from a former Special Forces combatant.
Mosgorsud reduced his sentence to 200,000 roubles.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and, accordingly, such a person must be held criminally liable,” explained the “Ozgorsud Ullian Solopov's “Press Secretary”.
In the present case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamaev, the factual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which a penalty may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Mamaev Vasily Serostanov, the court had not established the circumstances that would have led to a change in the category of gravity of the sentence and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he was dissatisfied with Mosgorsud's decision.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be to justify, to continue to fight for justice.
His counsel, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out the appeal to the Mosgaard Court of Cassation and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all leverage up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "RIA News."
To recall, the 28-year-old Moscow-year-old Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a criminal figure in the fall of last year.
The disabled man claims to have bought a scooter from a friend for 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, the proprietors of the motoraller, including a former SWAT fighter, claimed that the disabled and his assistant, Vasily Serostanov, had taken property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Tymiraziev District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasili Serostanov to three years ' imprisonment, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general-regime colony (art. 162, para. 2, of the Criminal Code).
The Public Chamber, the Office of the Attorney-General, the Human Rights Commissioner of President Tatiana Moscalkov, joined the case after the disabled person had been placed in the SIZO.
As a result, Anton Mamaev was released from the SIZO in mid-July by a decision of the same Tymirazev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsuda.
UNF will prepare a report to the President on the environment
The final Action Forum of the All-Russia People's Front (FP) in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, report to the “News” source in the UNF, and confirm the head of the Alexei Anisim movement.
According to him, as a result of the “Frontics” Forum, the President's report on domestic environmental problems was planned and a strategy was proposed to address them.
The interviewees in the UNF note that the report to the Head of State will contain a “deep analyst” on the situation in all the federal districts of the country.
According to The News, the final Forum of the UNF will be held in the fall.
The exact date has not yet been set - it is usually adapted to the President ' s schedule, who is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key FNL events.
The Front held several cross-regional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts in Rostovna Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulaan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will form systemic proposals to address environmental problems, and we have told the “News” of the interviewer in the FNL.
The Co-Chair of the Central Staff of the Olga Timofeyev Movement, the head of the State Committee on the Environment and the Environment, said that the “frontics” would report to the Head of State on the work carried out in the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the UNF Action Forum are likely to be combined.
In the course of the year, we grew up with a strong team of experts in the field of environmental issues, saw gaps in the law, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of the report we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the “frontics” also report on the work on the priority projects of the FNL, she told the News of Olga Timofeyev.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would be invited to the Forum.
He had previously participated in the UNF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will be history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to start up environmental mechanisms to work for years.
To keep these questions on the agenda, Olga Timothy added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), Andrey Kolyadin, noted that in raising the environmental issue, the FNL is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they offered as experts in various fora, and these initiatives received the support of the president, he said to the news by Andrey Kolyadin.
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be ruled out, which could give the regions additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the FNL, the regions will be able not only to address their environmental problems, but also to develop ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President had been asked about the Balaši dump site (already closed) and about the coal dust in the port of Nevodka (a bill had already been drafted to prohibit the open trans-shipment of coal in localities, one of the authors being Olga Timofeyev).
Ecology experts believe that the legal basis for dealing with environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been set up, the question is further law enforcement, as well as the position of civil society.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is needed, in the opinion of Leonid Bochin, head of the Charity Foundation “Ecology for All”.
A member of the HRC, the head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergey Tshiplenkov, in a conversation with the "Ivests" stressed that a successful solution to environmental problems required a responsible approach to society and business, with few legislative efforts.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution to environmental problems is a much more lucrative step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change, Sergei Chickenkov said.
The expert stressed that there was a need to reverse the trend that the violation of environmental law was a cost-effective solution for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and the car at the swing of his hand.
The British inventor was the first person in the country to have a microchip set up to open the door of his home, to enter the office, and even to start the car with a simple swing of his hand.
The 33-year-old Stephen Northham put a tiny chip between his thumbs and his index finger, and now, through his firm BioTek, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to make their lives easier by technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from the Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the infusion procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
Technology looks like a microchip that is used to cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds.
Nortem's company also replaces the locks in houses and cars with a chip-compatible value of 300 quid per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House Requisition cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to the records of the armed forces given to the magazine Time, the White House's decision last month to bring a Marine Helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost the taxpayers $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One", when the president is on board, became a central element of the event held in the White House on 17 July, at which American construction programmes were shown.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pens, and the White House's top officials have examined the technology products from all 50 states.
A helicopter made in Connecticut was placed next to a boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a cargo truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the unit responsible for managing the helicopter, the White House Military Department ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of a “unusual” event.
“I just wanted you to know that you know, because this is an unusually well-publicized event,” wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his supervisor, the first Deputy Air Force Chief, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive in the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and stay there until the lawn was released between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return in accordance with the time limits.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, while the guard of the unit remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records received by the magazine “TIME” whether the second crew was required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 specified whether the activity was in conflict with that order.
“We asked, among other things, if it was a violation of Hatch's law, and they said no,” the commander wrote.
“You seem to have nowhere to go,” the Deputy Chief replied.
The "Done in America" event was declared an official event by the White House and was not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even formal events have political notes.
During the event, the President made an effort to advance the reform of health, which was at the time in the drafting of the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft, known as "Marine One" and "air Force One" for political purposes, is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's not unusual to ask for them alone in the interest of photofidelity.
Trump was already the subject of discussion in February, when the president's plane drove in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was full of complaints about the use of the president's plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled with the show "Make America," which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American material," said Lyndsey Walters, the White House's Deputy Spokesperson.
HMX-1 crews often fly around the Washington Agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the president of the United States to transport to the White House to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight carried out for the "Done in America" event was counted to the crew for the necessary training flights in a month.
The unit's helicopters also overflyed 11 additional hours on that day as part of the “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not spend on any of the other items represented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in the South Lawn Helicopter Demonstration.
HMX-1 does not account for the budget for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the time rate of the Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the rate of reimbursement for the Department of Defense for the VH-3D is US$24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes each way from its airstrip at the Quantico Marine Airbase in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“The calculation of the cost to the taxpayers, based on an estimated rate of reimbursement, is very wrong,” says Walters.
“These indicative rates include personnel, services and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual allocation.”
According to a study carried out in 2015 by the RAND Corporation, the rates of reimbursement do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and the costs specified in the contract.
At the time, the former White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, spoke out to defend the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to show this week the things done in America,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose job depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have been working tirelessly on.
Therefore, of course, it is entirely appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter by inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he was exactly in the driver's seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump approached the company's representatives, making a joke with the press about his own fleet of the company's products.
"I know very well "Sikorsky," the president said. "I have three."
Moscow will provide grants for the emergency services of urban hospitals
Every year, “Save Life” grants will be allocated to the ICUs and ICUs of the Metropolitan Medical Clinic.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobyan, visited the Yudin City Clinic.
During his examination of the clinic, he gave a thank you letter to an orthopedic doctor, Victor Protsko, under whom the most complex operation was carried out to reconstruct the adolescent's foot.
Sergei Sobian also described the decision to grant grants each year to the ICUs and ICUs of urban clinics.
Funds will be allocated to the promotion of doctors and nurses.
According to the Metropolitan City Chief, the Yudin Hospital is currently one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, new modern equipment has been made available to the clinic to enable its doctors to perform unique operations.
The hospital was opened in 1961 at the Columen Rural Hospital.
At present, the health-care units are designed to receive over a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and hospitalization, there are day-to-day rooms.
The staff of the hospital is 2,800.
The total area of the health centre is 23.7 hectares.
In February this year, the medical institution became a member of a pilot project for the organization of short-term hospitalization (SPC).
They are designed to carry out relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical intervention, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly shorten the period of patient rehabilitation.
After the hospital operation, they spend only a few hours.
In the first six months of this year alone, 36,000 patients received hospital care at the Yudin Hospital.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations with varying degrees of difficulty.
NBU reported no buyers of the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
In the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) no bids were made for the purchase of the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
This is reported by TASS on Friday, 4 August, with a reference to a representative of the NBU Press Service.
The NBU confirms that, on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokopeni, was withdrawn to coordinate the indirect acquisition (through the Parity Bank) of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares.
“No documentation was received from other potential investors to buy Sberbank shares in the NBU,” states the report.
On 3 August, a Belarusian businessman, Victor Prokopenya, withdrew a bid to buy a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On 28 July, it was reported that the National Bank of Ukraine had refused Russian businessmen Said Guceriev and Gregory Guselnikov to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
The regulator based his decision on the fact that businessmen had not provided the necessary documents for verification of their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank announced the sale of his Ukrainian "girl" to Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, the son of a Russian businessman, Mikhail Guceriev.
The sanctions against the “girls” of the five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
In the course of the year, they are not allowed to withdraw capital from the country in favour of parent organizations.
Trailer of the third season of "Drug": In the popular "Netflix" series after the death of Pablo Escobar, the Cartel of Cali is central
Despite the discovery of the identity of Pablo Escobar's killer in the second season, the "Netflix" series is far from being finished.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons are scheduled, and the third has already been introduced by the first trailer to show the villains of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the Agency's attention was drawn by the richest drug-dealing organization, the Cali Cartel.
The organization, led by powerful godfathers, works as a corporation on the "Fortune 500" list, with only a large number of government bribes and acts of violence.
The leader of the Cartels is Gilberto Rodriguez Orehuela (Damian Alcasar), Miguel Rodriguez Orehuela (Frankrik Denis), her brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Amman) is in charge of relations with Mexico, and Chepe Santacrus-Londondoño (Pepe Rapazote) is working in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a figure that attracts American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war on drugs.
Other new actors included Mathias Varela, Michael Stahl David, Matt Willan, Igel Angel Sylvester, Kerry Bishé, and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Drug" will be released on September 1.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, said the United Nations.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, are present on Wednesday, when the head of the United Nations mission to Afghanistan stated.
According to Nicholas Heisom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for vice-presidentship, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only when women are fully involved and included in all stages of the electoral process.
The provincial council elections and the presidential elections will take place in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threaten to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year's elections, power is for the first time moving peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Heisom said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The Attorney General confirmed the indictment in the case of Nikita the White
The Russian Attorney General confirmed the criminal indictment against the former Governor of Kirov oblast, Nikita White, accused of receiving a major bribe.
On Thursday, 3 August, the agency reported it to the RIA News.
The material was submitted to the Presensky District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, the fines for tourists for improper conduct have been tightened
The Venetian authorities have tightened the canals' fines from Euro50 to Euro500.
Walking around the city in a bathing suit or with a bare body will now be fined 200 Euros.
For 100 euros, those who make a public picnic or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas will be required to pass the TASS with a reference to the Russian Association of Tour Operators.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine for monuments of 400 euro and for garbage of 25 euro.
To inform tourists of the need to observe the rules of conduct in Venice, a special company called Enjoy, Respect Venice (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) will be used to inform them about social media, as well as through ads and posters on the website of the City Council, on billboards, and at the most crowded tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the Tourism Adviser of Venice, Paula Mar, the fines will be transmitted to home country embassies to alert their compatriots to such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she said.
In April, the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow.
In Venice, the number of visitors to the city centre is already well under way.
Instead of the 100,000 people who want to observe the Festival del Rentore festival, only 60,000 guests have been admitted to the site.
In addition, there is a moratorium on the establishment of new hotels and restaurants in the historic part of Venice.
In the first half of 2017, the State Border Service detained 272 illegals at the border with EU countries, with 1,059 illegal migrants.
This was reported to the State Security Service.
Of those, 314 had been detained for illegal border crossing, while the rest had been detained for violating the rules of residence of foreigners in Ukraine and other offences.
The largest number, 717 illegal migrants, had been detained at the border with Moldova.
On the border with EU countries, 272 illegals were detained, most of them on the border with Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Romania.
Statistics show that most of the illegal migrants detained are citizens of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, India, Armenia, Viet Nam.
In addition, almost 2,000 potential illegal migrants had not been allowed to enter Ukraine.
Recall, the EU has found an unusual way to get rid of the migrants.

FS vacated Lake from head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday endorsed the statement of the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Victor Lakeov, and vacated him.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk province.
An application for his release from the lakes last week.
He explained his decision on the need for rotation and his desire to change the pace of life.
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.
Since 1996 Victor Lakeov has represented the Parliament of the Khabarovsk Region in the Russian Federation.
The Senate has been in charge of the Defence and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both the inhabitants and the producers of the storm
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (East Siberia) over the past decade to establish fair tariffs for electric energy users are beginning to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, the cost of low-tension electricity for industrial recipients has decreased by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation, in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation “On the amendment of the Regulation on the Optical Market for Electric Power and to the Combined Forecastal Balance of the Production and Supply of Electric Power (Energy) in the Russian Unified Energy System for the Russian Federation” (No. 842), established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers in the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electric power for drilling producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades, the leaders of the Republic have overstretched the thresholds of the Moscow cabinets in futile attempts to equalize the region in tariffs to the neighbouring Irkut region with the cascade of hydroelectric power stations in Angara, which stems from the Baikal region, for which Buryatia is the main catchment area.
And it was only this year that the changes began.
In March, the electricity rate for the population of the Republic was reduced from 4.24 roubles/kWh to 3.93 roubles/kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of the Bourging by the Federal Government in the List of Spatial Market Zones for which the characteristics of the operation of the wholesale and retail markets are being determined, a number of industrial consumers have emerged.
According to the analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/hour 1.01 roubles.
But no one dares to give at least an approximate date for new tariff shifts towards a lowering point for Buritia.

The National Union of unskilled, municipal and boiler workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in the McVite's factory in Glasgow
The union requires guarantees from the managers of the biscuit producer McVitie's in connection with his long-term obligation to produce at the Glasgow factory.
The Scotland branch of GMB reports that the company has left the issue of future investment at the Chicago site unchecked.
A factory that produces, among others, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVite's, reports that over 5 million pounds have been invested in the site over the past few years.
The company adds that, in the event of any change in the operation of the site, the employees and representatives of the trade union “are the first to know about them”.
In a letter to the head of the company's plant, the Scottish branch of the GMB demanded that McVite's react to the concern that funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
The senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “The members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the general manager of the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tolcross.
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in local society and in the territory of the Greater Glasgow; this is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, in terms of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the growth of the subsistence minimum and the chronic decline in production, the East End Glasgow is desperately in need of a flourishing production in the McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “the head of the Chicago site just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of the GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with the staff and union representatives.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolkrossa with GMB staff and representatives, at which a number of issues were openly discussed.
We talked to the staff about how, like all companies working in the most competitive and unstable economic environment, we are constantly rethinking our actions – and this is the case for all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Chicago facility, especially in production lines and improved functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production site, and, in the event of any change in the work at this site, the members and representatives of the union will be the first to know.
Putin said that the authorities would not give orders to Rosneft and Gazprom
Wladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas transfers to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHC) should involve the Kremlin and the Cabinet, but that no one would give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosnefti.
So Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, responded to Igor Sechin’s request to help resolve the controversy.
The Head of State pointed out that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be based solely on market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of a gas agreement with Gazprom for VNHC jeopardized the project's duration.
Sekin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on the issue was ongoing.
Gazprom offers to find gas resources from Rosnefti's perimeter, but we don't have that kind of resources," he added.
Recall that Rosneft requested permission to use gas from the Gazprom River in Kirin, located on the Sahalin shelf, for a “East petrochemical company”.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on the issue were ongoing, and that “there are no sharp edges”.
Did the SCW warn Barcelona about the Naimar transition three years ago?
A member of the League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris St. Germaine will not stop stalking Neumar after the club offered 189 million quid for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record three years ago?
The sensational proposal revived the summer transfer window, when League 1 was ready to break the world record at the cost of the transition, more than double the previous entry point for the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Naimar will become the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's highest-paying professional athlete, as SGW offers him a salary of more than £500,000 a week clean.
It is known that Barcelona is furious about how the offer was put forward, and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the fact that, according to a source close to the management of the Catalan Club, the club has always done its best for the player since he moved out of Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the president of the SVU?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the recruitment of Blaise Mathuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best players in the SVU.
“I'm not worried, because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're going to stand up to them, we're going to make offers to their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they'll have consequences."
It appears that Barcelona crossed that line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed an interest in Marco Verratti's SVU parafector.
SVU has made it clear that it will not release the Italian player under any conditions, and it is now likely that Barcelona is experiencing the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neimar.
Poetin's been assigned to take care of the payments made to the forest fire victims.
The Russian President, Vladimir Poetin, has instructed us to look into the material assistance that is being given to the forest fire victims and to the construction of new housing.
Today I'd like to hear how the work is going.
In particular, please report on the status of payments made to affected citizens.
I've got some confusion.
“In this regard, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about the amount of money allocated,” said Putin at a meeting with the leaders of the regions in the Baikal region.
On 4 August, Vladimir Poetin visited the Baikal State Natural Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by a full-fledged representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District, Sergey Majilo, and the head of the BIC branch of the FGBU, Glavibwod, Leonid Mihailik.
They described the work on cleaning the lake.
Then the boys were shown in an open container next to the container, which they had prepared for breeding.
First, Putin let a few boys out of the sack.
Then he pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and let the others out.
Also during the visit, the leader commissioned the management of the environment on the Baykale and the construction of a road on Olhon Island.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, one volume is needed, and another volume is required.
"I want to figure out what's actually going on with the finances," stressed the Russian leader.
Recall that during the forest fires of 2017, the towns of Buritia, Irkutsk oblast, had been hit with fire, and houses and buildings had been destroyed.
In Ukraine, a Russian was offered to go to prison for illegal border crossing
A draft law has been registered in the Supreme Council of Ukraine, according to which Russians may be subject to criminal penalties for the illegal crossing of the Ukrainian border.
According to RT, a document registered in the Ukrainian Parliament's electronic database presupposes a three-year prison sentence for Russian citizens who try to enter the country illegally.
It is noted that for a repeat offence or an act committed by a group of persons, the sentence may be extended to five years.
If the perpetrator had been detained at the border with the gun, the time of his detention would be eight years.
It was previously reported that Ukrainian border guards had detained Ukrainians who had tried to enter Russia outside the designated border crossing points.
"Magnet" went out in the open
The second food retailer, Magnet, announced the opening of three test shops in a new format, Magnet Opt, designed to buy small-scale products.
The company's press release continues to offer the option of buying the goods in the retail.
The shops in the new format were made in Krasnodar, Saratov and Uljanovsk.
Their range is about 1,500 items of food and non-food items.
“The new service will allow companies and businesses to make purchases for financial gain, while the residents will buy supplies for a week or a month,” they are confident of Magnet.
In the small-scale segment, Metro Cash & Carry and Selgros Cash & Carry are already in operation.
In 2017, Lenta launched a special program, Lenta Pro, which invited legal entities and private entrepreneurs to buy special hypermarkets, collect invoices to account for the costs and return VAT.
The project focuses on the HoReC segment, the small retail and the offices.
There will be two new territories in Russia that are ahead of economic and social development, Abosa and Novotrowitzk.
The relevant decisions of the Government of the Russian Federation will enter into force today, 4 August.
The borders and economic activities of the Torra have been defined in the territory of the city of Abaz in the Republic of Haqasiyah.
A city of 15,000 people will have a special legal regime for entrepreneurship, as well as a minimum capital investment of residents, and a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
This is expected to attract about 2.5 billion roubles of investment into the city, and to create more than 600 new jobs.
A list of economic activities in which ABAZ will have a special legal regime for business, e.g. crop production, livestock, food production, non-alcoholic beverages and clothing.
Already, the Government of the Republic has signed framework agreements for the implementation of eight investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the Territory's dependence on the Abakan Mining Company.
In January 2017, the authorities of the region reported that Hakasia had met all the conditions of the Mino-Economy for the establishment of the TOR.
The authorities of Orenburg region have also done so.
There, the city of Novotrojc will also create an area of pre-eminent socio-economic development.
This will allow the mono-urban economy to be diversified, to reduce its dependence on the U.S. steel-growing industry, and to create more than 2,300 jobs and attract more than 8 billion roubles of investment.
The list of economic activities in which the new TOR will have a special legal regime for entrepreneurs includes, inter alia, freshwater fish management, the production of feeds, medicinal drugs and medical materials.
Novotrowitzk was the first monocities in the Orenburg oblast to become TOR.
Recall that the pre-development area is an economic zone with tax-soft conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges that is created to attract investment in improving the lives of the population.
Among the benefits to the residents, the TORs include a profit tax of not more than 5 per cent for the first five years and not less than 10 per cent for the next five years, a social contribution of 7.6 per cent for 10 years, the use of the free-of-customs regime, the preferential treatment of the various infrastructure facilities, as well as favourable rents.
The vine called Manson "screw" and threatened to "screw the face."
Yuri Loza expressed his resentment at the American rock musician Marilyn Manson, who offended Moscow.
In an interview with "Comsomol Truth," the Russian singer called Manson "unsatisfied" and "let's beat it."
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow themselves to make such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
Besides, Loza thinks that Manson needs to be punched in the face for what he said.
To recall, the American artist, known for his estranged actions, made a rude statement about the Russian capital at a concert in Kyiv.
Earlier on Thursday, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that Manson's statement was commented on by the national producer Joseph Prigozhin.
