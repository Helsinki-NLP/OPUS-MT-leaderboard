28-year-old cook found dead at the San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old cook who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell of a local shopping center this week.
But the victim's brother says that he can't imagine anyone who wants to hurt him, saying, "He's finally getting along."
- The body found in Westfield Moll on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, as reported by the San Francisco Forensic Bureau.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told KGO's ABC radio station in San Francisco that Frank, the last chef of the distribution line in Boston, had won his dream job as a cook at the San Francisco's Sons & Daghters restaurant six months ago.
The Spokesman of the Sons & Doughers said that they were "shocked and depressed" by his death.
"We're a small team that works like a close family and will be very missed," said the representative.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had been staying at the hostels at first, but recently, "He's finally getting along well."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Luis Galicia said to KGO.
Louis Galicia said he can't imagine anyone who'd want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with the family has always been to make us some dish, to make us dinner,' said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any fight.
He was a brother who was sailing the stream.
"In all the bad things that are happening to this world, he was the unbridled diamond that shined brightly every day," he said.
Anyone in possession of information is asked to call the SFPD Hot Line at number 415-575-4444.

Italy's public debt rose to record
Italy's public debt in June 2016 was more than 2,248 trillion euro.
At the central bank, the country stated that this amount was the historical maximum, and it was transmitting to the RIA News.
The previous negative record was set in May this year.
At that time, the public debt amounted to 2,228 trillion euro.
It is noted that Italy's debt burden has increased by Euro77.2 billion in the first half of the year.
At the end of 2015, it had been reported that Italy ' s public debt was 132.7 per cent of the country ' s GDP.

The airport paid 141 victims of a terrorist attack at Domodedovo.
141 people received charity payments from the Airlines Foundation, which was set up by the management of Domodedovo Airport to help victims of the terrorist attack in 2011, reports Interfax.
According to the Spokesman for the airport of Alexander Vlasov, two more applications are currently under consideration.
“The fund is continuing to make charitable payments to the victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and to provide full assistance to address the current issues,” Vlasov added, recalling that a site of the fund was set up specifically to facilitate interaction with the victims, providing full information on the way in which the charitable assistance is provided.
In 2011, a bomb exploded in the flight hall of a foreign Airlines Domodedo.
As a result of the attack, 37 people had been killed, and 172 others had been injured.
Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
An international group of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrates are the Greenland Polar Shark, who can live for about 500 years, transfers RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five meters long, can be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in the longevity of sharks, leading to slow development.
Females of Greenland sharks reach puberty by the age of 150.
In the past, it was thought that the longest vertebrates live in a "neighbourly" shark, a Greenland whale.
The oldest man, known as a scientist, was just over the age of 210.
Poetin has reconfigured the Russian Federation.
Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, by decree made changes in the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, and informed the Kremlin's press service.
It had earlier become clear that Putin had removed President Sergei Ivanov's head of administration, and that Anton Wyno had been appointed as his successor.
Ivanov will now work as a special representative of the President in the field of environment, environment and transport.
From among the permanent members of the SC, the Russian Federation has been expelled as a member of the Council, Rashid Nurgaliev.
The council includes Sergey Ivanov, Anton Wyno, the half-president of the FOO, Sergey Mousileau, and half-century of the FZFO, Nikolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov was released from office as head of the President's Administration.
By decree of President Sergei Ivanov, he was relieved of his position as head of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov has been appointed Special Representative of the Russian Federation for Environment, Environment and Transport.
Anton Vineo was appointed the new head of the administration, who had previously held the post of Deputy Sergei Ivanov.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to move to another job.
Should we go to the sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the Chief Doctor of the Olga Bogosh Sanatorium.
And if a person is well, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
We need sanatorium resort rest not only for treatment, but also for disease prevention.
Under sanatorium conditions, a person can check his or her body and get advice from a doctor on how to live so that his or her health will not erode.
No one would need such advice.
"I'm just tired of work" is an important signal to the body, and it's not to get rid of.
Constant stress, mental and physical stress can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.
And the stress is around 90% of the people who come.
It is particularly prone to people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's best not to complicate the situation and let yourself rest on time.
Studies show that 98 percent of people have lowered their biological age while in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfort for the whole family.
So if you want to spend a vacation with the kids, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, there are health-care programmes that include both diagnostic services, paediatric consultations, tests and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, and medicinal exercise.
The course of the procedure is determined by the doctor, taking into account the individual statement and the characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, sanatoriums tend to have a children's club with animators, where children can go to play classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with infants, provide the baby with the necessary facilities, and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
The soft winter, the long summer, the overcrowded sunny days of the year (over 300) create a good environment for a round-the-year holiday in the Caucasian Mineral Water resorts.
And then the body doesn't just need to rest in the summer.
So you don't have to be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most of the procedures are indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for adults.
The main feature of the region of the Caucasus Mineral Water is, of course, curative mineral sources: Slavsky, Smyrnovsky, Escentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect different systems of the body.
Water varies by temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks up water depending on the patient's health.
Thus, Narzan has an anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulative effect, restores gastrointestinal tract functions and the exchange of substances.
Resentuki-4 is affecting the gastrointestinal tract, lowering the sugar level.
"Essentuki is new" has an anti-inflammatory, gallant, and moisturized effect.
The water of Slavonsky has the same effects.
The doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system when assigning water.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salty water, because the salts hold the liquid, resulting in an increase in pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires moderation: water should be consumed at a given time, at the right quantity and at a specific temperature.
The sanatoriums are now open to various cosmetic procedures for the face and body.
What types of recovery, based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus, can be obtained in the resorts of the region?
Near the Pigorsk, for example, there is the salty lake of Tambukan, which is used for joints, spine, and internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immunomodulative effect.
It's a healthy walk along individual routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
It is popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the mineral source Narzan.
There you can also take baths of wine, pearls, yovalent, selenium, salty-lacry, depending on what you get a doctor to do.
Let's extend the fruitage.
What can we do to make the crop go to the end of the season?
As told by Julia Belopukhov, an agronomist and a maiden.
It's time for the tall tomatoes to make a haircut: remove the new stepchildren, cut off the maizes, remove all the leaves to the penultimate brush with fruit, and blossoms with small patches - they won't be ripe.
All tomatoes, irrespective of the “constitution”, as well as peppers and aubergines, are fed with ultra-superphosphate tracts, biomedicines (Viewer - to accelerate the flow and growth of fruit, Phytosporin-M, Phytoslavin, Gamair, Baktofit - to prevent diseases, Immunocytophitis - to increase immunity, Bitoxibacillin, Lepidocide, Phytoverm - if there are pests).
At the end of the summer, chemicals are used only in copper, colloide sulfur, and green soap.
Let's make the last flood of plants.
The long-naked cucumbers in the casing are released from the wallpaper so that the lower, tanned part of the stem (25-40 cm) is laid on the ground, watered with warm water and the solution of the Circon, and the stem is sprinkled 5 to 7 cm of compost.
It is also easy to extend the fruitage of the courgette: cut off the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution to the complex fertiliser, and plant the fertile ground under the bush.
To protect you from the cold of the night, set up a chain of arc with concealed material over the ridge.
Keep the plant open during the day, and close it after sundown.
Marks of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
The economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in the last 20 years.
According to Bloomberg analysts, the GDP of the Russian Federation shows a positive trend - in the second quarter, GDP fell by 0.8 per cent in annual terms.
This figure has been minimal since early 2015.
According to recent data from Rosstat, the Russian economy slowed down to 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
Central Bank and the Mino-Economy have also recently reported on the stabilization of the situation.
The front is slow growth.
According to the CBD experts, the recession in the Russian economy is in the past.
“The index estimate of Russian GDP shows that the recession is behind us, and the slow growth of the economy ahead,” says the Bank of Russia’s Bulletin, “What Trends Say.
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter has increased to 0.4 per cent, and the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, in the second quarter the Russian Federation's GDP stagnated in the second quarter, at 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally purified GDP fell by 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, it stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was between 0-0.15,” quotes the representative of the IER RIA, "News".
The slowing down of the Russian economy over the last five quarters shows that “the bottom has passed”.
Among the other markers that indicate signs of national economic recovery, Bloomberg refers to the growing demand for electricity and rail transport, and to the reactivation of business.
If you make an adjustment to the fact that the year is high, it is clear that the trend of plus 1% of the electricity consumption can be due half to the extra working day.
Add to this the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it's hard to get accurate data, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by the seasonality,” explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR BORKER.
There are, however, other, more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering the price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared to 15.6 per cent last month.
In fact, Rossstat has recorded deflation for the last two weeks.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the evolution of the rouble, which, while showing strong swings at the beginning of the year, the result of August has been 12% stronger since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery that indicators from the real sector of the economy should follow,” Yakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, there has been an increase in industrial production in the Russian Federation since April.
In June, the figure rose by 1.7 per cent.
The rate of decline in foreign trade is slowing from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The situation in the labour market, where the unemployment rate fell to 5.4 per cent, also shows a positive development.
The following was only in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the question of the real disposable incomes of the population is not a good one.
In annual terms, the figure decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This may hinder the recovery of the economy, as household expenditures make a significant contribution to GDP.
Generally, their share in the structure of the economy is over 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia’s strict policy is also a risk factor for economic growth.
The controller holds the rate at 10.5 per cent, which is not the best effect on the real sector.
A negative factor is the low level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial capacity.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5 per cent, as opposed to -3.7 per cent in 2015,” Irina Rogova, an Analyst of the GC Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football, and well developed in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not yet been so active in summer sports.
While the Rio Olympics are for Russia, most of them are from former Soviet republics.
In Rio, however, we can see the reverse, with a significant number of Russians flying the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of change of nationality is different.
Some of the parents had been taken to another country when they were young, leaving no choice.
Someone couldn't stand the competition for a seat in the Russian team.
And some thought that a better environment for development in sport would be created abroad.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
That's where she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to pursue a mild athletic.
Like the sister, Lisa chose to jump from the sixth.
If she were to stay in Russia, I don't think she'd be able to move Elena Isinbaev off the throne.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be the only one of our countrymen, even if she was an ex, in the 6th jumping sector.
Her best success in this sport is the bronze of the 2010 European Cup and the silver of the mainland in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Helena Isinbaeva.
She was born in Novokuznski in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelists.
Much because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three.
In addition to Helena, there were eight children in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started getting into a fight when she was in high school.
With good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where the U.S. Training Centre continued to study under the leadership of another former Russian, Vladislav Isobnikov.
At the 2012 London Olympics, Elena lost her first fight.
But at the World Cup in the same year, it's a win.
Before that, by the way, she had won the silver at the 2010 world premiere.
This was followed by a 2013 bronze and a 2014 silver.
Mary, 26, was born in Yaroslavla, where she first met the synchronized voyage.
But it would be wrong to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and move to Colorado.
There Mary continued her studies.
She was a member of the U.S. team and had a great record at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that, at a serious international level, it cannot compete with Russian synchronists, but for America, it is the ceiling.
A new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Christina Shaldibina at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue training the girl in art gymnastics beyond the ocean.
Until then, the girl had been engaged in her favorite sport in her home country, Jaroslavla.
After migrating to the United States, she quickly joined the country's youth team, and later entered the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen conquered gold and silver.
She did not, of course, have to fight for the first positions on the world stage, but for the US, she set up a real breakthrough by putting a star-size team out at the Rio Olympics.
Another of our ex-artists is Ian Berezko-Margrander, who is in favor of the German team.
She was born in Toliati.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects for joining the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 London Olympics.
There, though, Ian was only able to take the 17th place that was not enough to get into the final competitions in her personal first place.
But two years earlier, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympics, a young man.
Another gymnast, but this time the sporting room is Irina Sazonova.
If the way of migrating the above-mentioned athletes can be described as standard, the choice of the Irina family is very unusual in Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she immediately became the country's champion.
True, Ira is still training in Russia - coming to his home country on purpose to keep his skill.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she wanted.
The best place is 40 in a personal multi-war.
There is very little record of the swimmer Maria Coalkova in the Russian information area.
For a very long time, Mary has been living and training in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it had been under the Russian flag, showing good results - even the country's record for 200 meters of butterfly.
In 2015, she acquired Swiss citizenship and began to fly a red-and-white flag.
In Rio, her best speech is the 14th place in the 4×100 complex relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project that was able to raise some 6,000 francs, which enabled her to pay for the preparation for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batirov, spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, Hasaurt's native became the three-time champion of European championships, Russia's champion, and Russia's international class sport master.
When he stopped joining our national team, it was time to think about a change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from the sporting posts.
A triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Cup - Batarov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and won a trip to the Rio Olympics.
There is still less known about another Russian, Michael Kudinov, in his home country than even the Swiss swimmer Mary Ugholkov.
The fact is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started his gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, the best result was the 40th place in parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her training in synchronized swimming, showing good results at the national level.
In 2014 at the European Cup in Berlin, the girl was ranked 6th in the synchronized voyage.
In a duo with Eugenia, Tethelbaum Anastasia was ranked eight.
In the solo program, it was the fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Croiter is in favor of Israel's team.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dimitri was the country's champion.
He won the World Cup in the same year.
A year later, Croyter won the gold of the Singapore Young Olympics.
In addition to high jumping, Dmitri jumps in length and triple jumps.
31-year-old Albert is another resident of Hasaurth, who, after a long campaign for Russia, decided to change his sporting citizenship.
But, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In the Russian Federation, he was a champion of the School of Higher Sports of Krasnoyarsk, even becoming a champion of the country in 2011.
Oleg Antonov, 28-year-old, was born in Moscow as a member of the USSR volleyball team, Jaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before his son was born, Jaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
There, the family remained permanent.
In 2015, he became a bronze champion of the European Championships in his new home country.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was born with his family in the middle of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
Soon he won the world's first of all among the juniors, and later qualified to participate in the Olympics.
In Rio, he will be the sole representative of France in the competition.
Again the free fight, and again the former Russian.
This time, we're talking about a native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, the Timeuraz Frieva.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is currently in favour of the team of the country.
Prior to that, it is true that a 30-year-old sporter had been able to record high scores in Russia.
He became the bronze champion of the 2007 and 2008 championships.
The statute of absence from the team, Timuraz, decided to change the state of sport.
The last one on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahachal, Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur started boxing on the advice of his older brother.
Arthur has since been a champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he was a champion of the world among young people.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new home country since 1975.

Valid State Counsellor of the Russian Federation, class 1 (Classified by a decree of the President of the Russian Federation of 22 January 2008)
Honours of the President of the Russian Federation (16 February 2012) for the service of the Government of the Russian Federation and for many years of good-faith work.
Thanks to the President of the Russian Federation (24 November 2005) for the preparations for and observance of the 60th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War.
Married, had a son.
Why do kids have cossack classes in school?
According to Governor V. Condratiyev, "the message is to be raised systemically, not by actions and parades."
They must grow up and understand from at least 7 years of age that they are cossacks and education must be cossacks.
But as far as I'm concerned, this job is being formalized and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes take in all the positives that have been built up earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I'd be glad to.
If everything's up and down and unfamiliar, the new idea will turn out to be a cheap populism.
The GCO continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country ' s economy.
There is an infringement of the community by means of funds allocated to the public sector from different levels of budgets.
According to the Attorney-General's Office, overpriced tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of LKK.
As a result, the region's consumers overpaid over 170 million roubles.
Recently, the Krasnodar State Attorney's Office also found that there was undue cost to the tariffs.
And the cost of the GMO “IV-consulting” (cold water) was 4 million roubles for the rental of cars at a price higher than the market.
And there's a lot of such examples in the country.
According to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: waste, legalization of the proceeds of crime, abuse of power, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund who was working on the renovation of the city, Makarov entered into contracts with the businessmen, the work on them was not actually carried out but paid for.
The businessmen just gave him most of the money.
And as the owner of the PC, Makarov collected money from the public, but the service providers did not pay and spent it on their own.
As a result, there are millions of roubles in the budget and the inhabitants.
Macarov's scheme is, unfortunately, typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions of the heads of the Criminal Code, who had embezzled the money of the citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan is under way, by the way, also by a former councillor, who is charged with 91.7 million roubles of fraud.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, he established six management companies in the Elizovo district of Kamchatsk and set up three limited liability societies.
One of them was engaged in contract work for the CC, and the other two served as clearing-houses, i.e. receiving money from the public.
But A. Cohan's energy didn't pay the money, but spent it on himself, the one he loved.
It's hard to sue the GKH.
It's not getting started, it's getting slow.
And "helps" in this highly complicated housing law, Svetlana Provertev, the executive director of the NPA, "GMC Control."
We don't have time to make one law, as we come up with a new one that should make the last one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, in the area of VCS.
Lawyers themselves recognize that very little attention is given to housing law in higher education.
The Attorney-General's Office also talks about the refusal to initiate criminal proceedings, and the use of fissures in the course of investigations.
Of the 3,500 crimes under trial in 2015, less than half had been brought to trial.
The rest of the investigation took a long time, and one in five was suspended due to the lack of identification of the accused.
Inadequacies in law enforcement are often attributed to gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the Investigative Departments are slow to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 allegations of forgery - only 60 criminal cases had been brought.
In the 5 months of this year, the number has only slightly increased - 99.
What is the falsification of the tenants' protocol?
This means that the change of management of the home, financial and other matters tend to sway the views of the owners.
It also means that the housing and public services market cannot be accessed by normal companies that want to work honestly, not to “cool” the population.
So the tenants are minus, the small and medium-sized business, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption per se throughout the State, Anton Jarkov, a member of the State Property Committee.
This work is now under way.
This is not just a single action, but a focus on the fight against corruption.
Of course, not all regions are so sad.
In particular, there's no scandal in the capital.
Why is there no such scandal in Moscow in the area of GKH as in many other regions?
Because the capital government has shown iron will and put order, Anatoly the Chosen One, a member of the State Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, told AIF.
I mean both human resources, legislative amendments, and legal education.
Superintendents are subject to close supervision, and all have been licensed.
Citizens' complaints are quickly resolved in public space (and calls from tenants, and responses are posted on the Government of Moscow's Portal).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but keep an eye on what it says about the house.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is testing the validity of the housing and public service tariffs, as a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
This is probably all about the calm situation in Moscow.
So it's all about the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the willless should change the place of work.
Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up his friendship with the EU and the US?
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, put forward an ultimatum to make a choice between Turkey and Fathullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d'état.
He said that in front of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to give up their support for the "Terrorist Fethullahist Organization."
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the US calls for a change of position.
Experts believe that the divisions between Turkey and the West are growing and can lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"America will make a choice between Turkey and the FETO ("Terrorist Fethullist Organization").
Either the organizer of the FETO coups, or the democratic Turkey.
She has to make that choice,” quotes the Anatoly Agency's Erdoğan address, which was made on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but he was stricter in demanding that the US comply with his demand, which he made the first time in the wake of the uprising.
Let us recall that, on the night of 16 July, the Turkish Army made an attempt to overthrow the legitimate power of the country in Turkey, as well as an attempt on the life of the Head of State.
However, after Recep Erdoğan addressed the population, the mutiny was overwhelmed and the organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, some 8,000 people were suspected of being teachers and academics, in addition to the military.
According to Regep Erdogan, they were mentored by Fethullah Guellen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdoğan’s supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the coup d’état.
The United States denied all claims, refusing to hand over Guillen and recommending a change of tone.
The last statement made by the State Department was made at the time of Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
But this does not stop the President of Turkey - he insists on it and also demands on his other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to meet its obligations under a migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not set a date for the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens,” said the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Chelik, on 9 August.
He said that the change of the anti-terrorist law by Ankara, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe’s own security.
Note that on 1 August, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the EU with promises to open borders to migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His remarks responded to the relevant statement made by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mevluth Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu made last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not rule out that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance if it did not receive the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence field is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that are cooperating with foreign States in the field of defence - they import missiles,” said Chavushoglu in an interview with Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system on the basis of its technology, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
“Turkish has so far tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others,” the Minister said.
The experts believe that all of this speaks of Turkey’s serious disagreement with the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdoğan is currently playing his game and cannot face a brutal confrontation with the West.
He has a lot to do with the West in both business and military terms (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdoğan will try to balance with the West.
Though, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a fully obedient man in this post,” the expert explained to AIF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the Turkish leader’s statements (on the non-payment of EU compensation, the demand for visa-free space with Europe, and the release of Guillena from the US) he will be under pressure.
“Regep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of government, and so on,” Minchenko claims.
The head of the Centre for Political Information, Alexei Muhin, accepts that the President of Turkey will change his point of view with Russia as soon as he enjoys it.
Eight months ago Erdoğan took a very hard stand against Russia and sought favor in all ways in the West.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that, after a while, the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdoğan has entered shuttle diplomacy.
Having been between the two poles, the West and Russia, he will try to make the most of it for himself,” Muhin believes.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to hold political power in the country, and to that end, he needs Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop the US from supporting Guelene.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, consensus will be reached with Turkey,” the expert considers.
The head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glassov, has taken a different view.
Today, Turkey’s relations with the EU and the US are rather strained, and this is particularly linked to the domestic policy that Erdoğan personally pursues.
I think that this crisis will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset the policy in both the Middle East and Russia.
It is not by chance that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, claim that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, have settled relations with Israel, are engaged in active political engagement with Iran,” explained AIF.ru Glassov, which allows Erdoğan to take the next step to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdoğan is currently pursuing is a return to the foreign policy approach that Turkey followed before the Arab revolution.
“It was at that point that Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in a very active way in terms of “zero problems with neighbours”.
There have now been very successful visits by the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and promote Turkey's position on both the regional and international fronts,” the expert considers.
The eye believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relationship with the EU, and the question now is whether the EU will begin to respond harshly to Turkey, which can open up borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Paramedics strike: Call for new collective protests
Representatives of the paramedics requested the trade union to approve new collective protests in their dispute over a new contract of employment.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Medical Assistants' Committee (JDC) is about to ask its full board to support more collective protests from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers failed to answer the questions about the contract of employment.
In July, the junior doctors and medical students voted to cancel the contract with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members voting by secret ballot.
In a letter to the members on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC president Helen McCord said that the government continued to "strongly shut up" about the problems that she said had led to the rejection of the contract.
She said, "Bearing in mind the current situation, the head of the JDC voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new contract of employment in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your matters."
In response to the government's silence, JDC's head today made a formal request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuous programme of expansion of collective protest since early September.
The dispute led to the participation of young doctors in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the Public Health Service.
BMA's associate doctor, Dr. Joan Malawana, resigned after a vote to annul the agreed terms of the contract of employment, which BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to be accepted during the meetings in advance of the voting of 54,000 paramedics and medical students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that this contract of employment would be used for health-care workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "The Alliance of Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden Hall of the Palais in St. Petersburg, I had the strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile seemed strained, and he hardly emitted warmth even by his own self-conscious standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in contrast, has repeatedly spoken of his "sweet friend" to Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost track.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis levels, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the extinct cooling coming from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first one he mentioned in the opening remarks: Turkey hit a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was violent.
Mr. Poetin broke out with an angry tirade, accusing Ankara of punching Moscow in the back.
The insult was even more intense on the basis of an alleged friend.
The restoration of real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
Over the months, the state-controlled media had carried out a staggering, total attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed that the Turks should be held guilty of everything.
The most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Mr. Erdoğan's own family had profited from the illegal trade in oil from Syria's zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied it.
But in St. Petersburg, the official signal was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin received the apology he was demanding from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdoğan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost demolished last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey had clearly shaken him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring a few million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, the tour operators and charter companies here will, of course, feel relieved when the flight finally resumes.
They're putting at the top of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, public TV predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish import of agricultural produce was allowed again.
"The tomatoes are there, the tomatoes are back here," as the report said in the report.
But the visit also had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is mad at the West for what it considers a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to that her long-standing dissatisfaction with the pace of conversations about joining the EU and the move of Mr. Putin to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus scores with Ankara for calling for support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Bear in mind, this is a gift for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this shining palace on the coast of the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to picture what one analyst described to me as the “allanx of the bad”: the two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West join forces.
Despite the public display of reconciliation, however, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
Perhaps speaks for themselves that after almost three hours of initial talks, while the two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and given the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a member of NATO was hit by a Russian jet fighter — it is best that the two leaders are at least talking again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear to clients outside Scotland.
Brand RBS should be reduced to the role of back office, according to the bank's executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear to clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC of Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank had withdrawn from them since it had almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used "RBS" to protect other brands of consumer credit.
He was supported by millions of pounds of international sport support, from the six-nation Rugby Cup to the Whimbledon Andy Murray Champion.
But it's now decided that it's right to let more national brands get to the top.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scotland clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already being used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking that will have a greater impact - Cutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview on a tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brand RBS will eventually be our investment brand and the one that our staff will be in, because we are now becoming a more brand bank."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something very different in its own population, and our staff will work with clients under those brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation Cup, and it is building a profile of different brands in sport.
"This is the right time for us to move the brand bank, because the basis (we asked ourselves) is how we focus on improving the customer bank?" said the executive director.
It'd be very cynical three years ago if we said that we were gonna be a great bank for clients and shut down all those brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on the needs of our clients, not on our own, I think you see a lot of change.
We can get those brands back, so I think it's time.
Franky Dettory gets up to 3000 wins in New Market on the Priestia.
Dettori sprays the champagne after the take in Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettory won his 3000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track - on the Prestition, trained by John State.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who has reached this remarkable mark in a smooth race.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Iddie, and Willie Carson.
Three-time jockey champ Dettory, who had previously won the Gayar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarket, because that's where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big social event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night with 20.000 people.
I'm free of business and very unattractive.
Dettoria accepts applause when it leads to predestination after victory
The two jockeys reached this point in the race with obstacles: jockey champ Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 wins in a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby Winner, 4493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era, and it is not surprising that he has reached that mark, which so few have reached.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical smartness that distinguishes him from the others in the weighting room.
He's a great race rep, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he'd bring 6,000 winners if he weren't just a jockey for weekends and big jumps!
And, seriously, Frankie's been bringing the winners to Britain for most of 30 years, which is good to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for the British race, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettory celebrated this remarkable mark with a brand-new fast jump off the horse.
From the fast finishes to the fast jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of the British smooth leaps for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
Many of the winners of the big race, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the crash and was disqualified by the doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed a great deal of will to challenge skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while, and Dettory said earlier that he would like to continue to compete at least until he was 50.
Putin fires the Chief of Administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a part of Putin's trusting next door for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed as a representative for the environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “determined to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the president,” but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy, Anton Wyno, has been appointed his successor since 2012.
Mr. Wyno, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the Office of the President's Protocol and the Office of the Government, reporting the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
At the time of his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your work as head of State in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being followed up.
Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be excused and recommended that Wyno replace him.
Are Smileys Convincing?
This is a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been a close supporter of Vladimir Putin and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, the KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on State TV, both men stated that the head of the administration had resigned on his own accord.
But despite the smiles on the camera, there's not a lot of people here, especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unintended consequences of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that the man who was once agitated as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russian environmental policy — was met with huge scepticism.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very complex position, even a problem post, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was head of the president's office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSS), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five most trusted.
It was once thought that Ivanov might have been the president of Russia after Putin’s second term, as Putin’s third term would have run counter to the Constitution.
However, this post was occupied by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until his return to the presidency after just three and a half years.
The star of "Think Like a Criminal" by Thomas Gibson is fired after a fight with the producer.
Gibson was a part-time shooter at a show in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and the CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, have announced his dismissal in a joint application.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday, before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences in the shoots and differences of opinion.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be struck out of a show that monitors the FBI's team are expected to follow later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
A 54-year-old actor who had previously played a leading role in the Dharma and Greg Sitcoms was on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love thinking like a criminal" and I've put my heart and soul in it for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement he published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of it, but now it's not gonna be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, most of all, the best fans the show ever dreamed of.
The show is scheduled to return with its 12th season on September 28.
Mystery: The fish landed in the garden of Banfa
A man from Banfa sought help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish might have been sandstones left behind by a water tornado.
Bane, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a picture of the spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone might shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
The Bridge is now linked to Fife.
The $1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the North and Queensferry Crossing Viadic, which means that the bridge is now linked to Fife.
This is the first of the four links between the "vegets of the canvas" that are now coming to completion near all three pilons of the bridge.
The Fife Bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vants of bridge.
The $1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Kit Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering art on a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the link between the Viaduk and the bridge canvas is a virtual operation using extremely accurate assembly tolerances.
A total of about 79% of the entire bridge canvas is now in place, and for the last section of the linen, concrete is poured out in Rositt today, which means that the whole canvas is ready to go up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, the director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first link on each bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this interface is the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the road and linking it to the expanding roadwork of the North Pioneer, we had to close the remaining gap on the north side, or the side to the shore.
This was done by dragging the viaduk of the northern approach up to 700 millimetres south.
It was a large-scale and, at the same time, very elegant operation.
Large, because the video is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons, and was to be raised to a tilt angle of about 3%.
It's elegant, because the tolerances the team was working on were tiny -- just a few millimeters in each direction.
Luckily, it all went very well.
Salvation in the Bay of Moelfre: Three men's luck to stay alive
Three men had "happy to stay alive" after they had been thrown off a fishing boat in England.
The Moelfre RNLI alerted at 1:20 a.m. British summer time on Friday, after the crew saw an incident unfolding in the Gulf of Moelfr.
Three men tried hard to make it to a safe place, while their ship continued to sail.
"We've seen their ship circling next to them and assuming the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happily, by the time we went down to the water, the strong wind had taken him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and gripped by a buoy without a lifejacket.
All of them were boarded by the shore lifeboat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely intact.
The engine had an emergency fuses, but somehow it got off the man running the boat when it rolled over.
Someone was guarding these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time watching screens, has been a complaint to many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go disengages people from the couch and engages them in some physical activity.
The time in the screen was initially limited to TV, video games, and recent smartphones.
It's so good to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the total fascination that Pokémon Go is, an app based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which produced a series of cartoons, play cards, and other shares).
Like many other pop-cultural events, all of this became irrelevant a little earlier than this new game was made available in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed at that time due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, the smartphone players are looking for the Pokemons, which are tracked by the GPS and, if found, can be "photo-photo" (through a screenshot on your phone) or "captured".
The generation that was playing the game as a younger man joined the prowl, breaking off the search sofas.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by a “normal” person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people tracked by them, who performed 30-minute daily exercises, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the basic data on levels.
Many health-care campaigns that convince people to "find 30 minutes," "get off the couch" and "be active every day" did not find a response, because most health messages are boring and are spoken out by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high arterial pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it drags people out to do what they love.
Thus, there are three health bases: movement, fresh air, and sunlight, and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring nerds who are looking for something to complain about.
And, yes, someone might run into the door.
So what?
There's been a break.
Because even though smartphone apps, like Fitbit, might have been able to track our physical activity before, they didn't give us a reason to learn, as this game does.
The news is on the table, and the use will fade over time.
However, the success of Pokemon will create more games that combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to hunt for more active, in good shape, and healthy.

Simone Bayles wins the absolute gold in female gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the fuss.
Simone Bayles is invincible for all of this.
Dynamic on the back jump.
Unforced on the log.
stunning on the floor.
Fascinating everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic Champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast went up to the title of absolute championship on Thursday, putting the gulf between one another and the rest of the world on a persuasive demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her total score was 62.198 from the silver medalist and teammate Eli Reisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alija Mustafina.
Bayles, from the United States, performs at the Gymnastic Tree during the finals of the female individual absolute first in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bayles became the fourth in a row an American woman to win the title of absolute championship and the fifth in general, establishing her reputation as the best of her generation and, perhaps, ever.
She cried when her final score was shown, and her long journey was over by now.
This achievement puts her in the same league as the extremely rare athletics, such as Michael Phelps, who raised their sport to new heights:
Byles spent the last three years dominant in her sport, winning 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold medals - with such staggering programs in their mix of hard work and precision that the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton called it "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test was in Brazil, a competition not so much between Bayles and the rest in the field, but between it and the cargo of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be viewed as an unfulfilled expectation.
Simone Bayles, from the United States, on the left, and Eli Reisman are hugging after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the finals of the female individual absolute first in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Bayles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the retiring national team coordinator Martha Karoli's farewell party.
While Bayles insisted that she never looked in the future on her long trip to the top, it's not quite the case.
A part of her free exercise program, which includes her special passage, is set up on Latin music, which would go right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandpa, as a child, and opened up by the mother of coach Aimee Burman during her visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn't lost a single absolute race since the summer of 2013, a track of luck that should last as long as Bayles wants.
Although Mustafina had a small advantage by means of two rotations, it was a mirage.
The hymn log and the free exercise, where Bayles defends the title of the world's champion, are ambushed.
She again went forward with 15.433 on the log and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
Reisman hugged her gently while they were waiting for the final score, a pure formality, and the tears appeared around a shiny red and blue eyeliner for the eyes of Bayles, when the design that she had once recorded in the clipping album came true.
Reisman's speech was a small revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost Mustafina's bronze on the tai.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "Grandmother," was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise covered by the return, which sometimes seemed to be in question.
As for Bayles, a 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week now has a very new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who had died in the most deadly attack in the first episode of Phoenix's murder in the last decade had been in the car, talking and listening to music when they had been shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot dead on 12 June when their car was parked on the carriageway, and the authorities announced.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots from a gun standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he escaped on another vehicle, and reported.
The police claim that the triple murder does not seem to be the result of the robbery, as the intruder did not take the wallet or the $2,900 that was at the disposal of an adult victim.
The Phoenix Police Representative, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting had prompted the investigators to check whether he had been involved in the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"This is happening in a residential area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, the CBS branch, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked to one another and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a report by the police on the shelling, the aim of which was an empty pick-up half an hour before the triple murder, and which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The investigators found the casings and extracted the bullet from the seat and the fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with a microcephalus: "It's getting better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto likes to sing, toys, and, of course, his mom.
But unlike most of her peers, Edmund had microcephalus as a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixivto, did not know when she was pregnant.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do it.
I didn't sign up for it.
Which, in fact, is not true -- of course, you're signing up for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized hospital.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing this," Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He walks with extraneous help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and to sing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund made for "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just a regular sign language, she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalus can result from a number of different factors: genetics, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zeke.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary significantly.
It is too early to say how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zeke virus.
Piksivto remembers the emotional loss of an uncertain future.
Did I keep telling you what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime prognosis, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has an encouraging advice for the mothers of children with congenital defects due to Zeke.
It's getting better.
You know everything's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Severe rain, flooding causes rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state by Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and south Mississippi have come out of the shores and threaten large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, reported the National Meteorological Service.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bell Edwards, said that government officials were in constant contact with the local authorities and that the aid had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that requests were being made for transport for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that it was only the parish of Tanjipahoa that asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The risk of flooding remains valid until Saturday in most of the south of Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an extra 3 to 5 inches might slide to the area.
In southern Alabama, the waiting hours for the flood continued until Friday, as it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The Comite River next to Baton Rouge and the Amit River next to Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are projected to have set a record of flooding last weekend.
Sinoptic Alec Crowtmann said that both rivers might have flooded many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flood that flows downstream in the Assensen parish is a threat, as these swelling rivers will flow slowly into Lake Morpa.
The Ticfo River, just south of Mississippi's border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.
Squads still pulled people out of the flooding in Amit and Wilkinson County in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stiefson were among the rescued early on Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, aged 62, says the Beaver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, quickly rose overnight.
He said that the other stepson, who lived in the area, had warned him.
"We woke up, and the water continued to rise," Hansford said.
She's reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest tributary she had seen in 48 years that she had lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family had a disability, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers had saved all three of them with an army truck and taken them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Crowtmann says that the flood is spreading fast, as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Crowtmann said that an observer near Livingstone had reported 13.775 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Crowtmann said that the soil was overfilled with rain from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets have led to the work of rescuing residents from their homes in the parish of Tanjipahoa and the abolition of classes in five school districts, the authorities claim.
WWL, a branch office of CBS, reports that adviser to Tanjipahoa spoke of 200 flooded houses.
Residents have been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooding.
The president of the parish, Robbie Miller, said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amit and in the city of Hammond to accept those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water begins to retreat," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the parish of Tanjipahoa was closed to about two dozen streets because of the high water level, and sandbags were available for distribution to the inhabitants in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said the city manager Lacey Landrum.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Services, Rupert Lacey, reported that the rain had continued on the Gulf coast.
According to him, several houses had been registered as flooded on Thursday, but none had been registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, manager of the Shopper Value Foods store in Amit, lives in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," said Towson, "and it's still pouring on the ground."
Mahage Brown, 6, "cut off by bullets," is still alive after the shooting in Philadelphia.
The police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering a second shot at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
His grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandma and grandpa say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He's been hit hard, his little body was shattered with bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez at the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has experienced several surgeries.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to the first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Jermantown quarter.
Three men, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds, were also shot.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-olds is in critical condition; the other two were registered in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The baby was found shot in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting to the station.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men might have been the shooter.
Investigators report to the CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been an exchange of fire between several armed men.
Semi-automatic casings, attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons, have taken place.
Seems like it was definitely a long fight.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the side of the sidewalk.
So it looks like there were a number of armed men and they were actively involved in the shooting,” reported the station's captain of the Philly Police Force, Anthony Ginaldi.
Many of the houses and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and the police are reportedly looking at the CCTV.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit in the hand by a shanky bullet on Tuesday, when he was playing in front of his home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby, and Lori
That's what I call the women's gymnastics team this year for a number of reasons.
First, I've been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, three gymnasts, Simona Bayles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, have played a key role in this team, and have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is a Jew, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, female gymnast number one has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At the last Gabby Douglas Olympics was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
The world could now have witnessed the incredible three-time World Cup of Simone Bayles, Douglas, and Lori Hernandez performing unexpected but still virtual gymnastics.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win the gold in the individual absolute first place of the woman.
And Ali Reisman's teammate earned the silver.
We're witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like that in gymnastics all over the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Lori all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the final five, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli's coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics are expensive sports, and gymnastics are first trained in private gymnasium clubs supported by parents, paying the cost of training, equipment, travel, uniforms, fees for competitions, hotels (for coaches and their gymnasiums and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and this is a dear and long-term responsibility for gymnast families.
Aimee Burman, the coach of Simone Bayles, and Maggie Hani, the coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes from the moment they started gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and affordable training for the community of gymnastics for countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lori.
I started my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youths (mainly blacks and Latin Americans) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Hymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to weariness, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a life-long positive impact on good health, school success, and work.
It's the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that's perfect.
Sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a great time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Lori, Gabby, and Madison for this serious show of the "Women's Force" winning the team's Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong, and successful young women.
The younger doctors took up the announcement of further strikes after the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's offer.
The Ministers had hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing to a modified contract with the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who had voted had rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the contract, saying that NHS was on no land, and any subsequent delay would cause harm to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in night work and weekends to improve out-of-school services.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Young Doctors' Committee, BMA, said last night in a statement, "The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it feeds on the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly."
It is only eight weeks before the first group of doctors are reassigned to a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The VMA's attempt to resolve the dispute in the talks was met by a reluctance to take action, and at times with complete silence on the part of the Government.
And that despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, to inspire the introduction, and to respond to the concerns of the junior doctors.
If he does not do so, then the younger doctors are clear that they are ready to organize a follow-up strike.
The last strike in late April delayed some 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nurses, while the nurses and counselors were engaged to secure the replacement of doctors in the picket line.
The ministers had hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing to a modified contract with the British Medical Association.
IMA wants to pay a better day off for 54,000 junior doctors who will fall under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the CEO of NHS Employers, urged the junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said, "The strike reaches little or nothing, but puts pressure on the already operating teams and services, and causes anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
The workers had hoped that the continued positive assistance on other important topics — such as the distribution of staff, the flexibility of training, the extra training for those who return after a career break, the cost of training, the mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and the gender pay gap in medicine — had been a sign of how serious the employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health had intended to meet the conditions that had been achieved by the IMA in November, February and May.
A 2-per-day drug can reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use a 2-per-day drug after the authorities have recommended that it be given to more people for a longer time.
The anti-rotation drug ticgrelor reduces the risk of relapses for people with cardiac diseases.
The drug is already scheduled for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE Service of the National Health Service of the United Kingdom recommended that it be given to people for four years in order to prevent the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, the NICE Service of the National Health Service of the United Kingdom has advised people to give it for four years in order to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs every year to about 140,000 people in England, and a quarter of them have another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque is torn apart, it can cause a clot that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot shifts, it can move through the flow of blood and block the flow to the brain by causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Tikagrlor, a British-owned AstraZeneca company, is sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making the clots less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg ticgrelor for 12 months, then 60 milligrams of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, Director of the Health Technology Assessment Centre of NICE, said, "Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention methods with about a quarter of the people who have already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life.
There is evidence that ticgryl, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
While we pre-advise the ticgril, we are happy to be able to expand the treatment available to the many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
As information on the efficiency and safety of the ticgrlor, particularly the risk of bleeding, is limited at the end of three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than that.
The culture of PC ownership allows for the falsification of votes in Muslim districts to flourish
The ex-mayor of the Tower-Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was suspended last year because of corruption, serving as a trigger for the Government's report.
A culture of political correctness has led to blindfolding, which has resulted in the widespread falsification of votes in Muslim communities, according to the information from the destructive government report that was released today.
Sir Eric Peakles, a former Cabinet Minister, is critiqued by the police, election monitors and city administrations for ignoring evidence of electoral irregularities due to “excessive sensitivity to race and religion”.
The former secretary of local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the intimidation of religiously motivated voters was so strong that the police should be allowed to place borders outside polling stations in order to protect fearful voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
For the time being, voters should simply indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests that the ink should be applied to the fingers of the people when they deliver their ballots, so that someone can vote twice.
Better protection is needed for informants, Sir Eric said.
It calls for greater press access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet electoral scandal in East London.
Last year, the special election court ruled that the current Mayor of Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office in connection with a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rachman “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, “went his campaign on the basis that it was the responsibility of Muslims to vote for it”.
Up to 300 votes were the result of doubt or the result of a person voting, pretending to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He raised particular concerns about mail fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community had reportedly put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made a number of recommendations to clear the voting system, including the requirement to bring his identity card to prove who you are.
His report states: “Provided evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at the will of the elders, particularly in the communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There was a fear that ... public institutions had closed their eyes to such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of `political correctness' to ethnicity and religion."
Sire Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the suspension of political activists from working with the postal ballots to stop the “growing of votes”.
The report under consideration by Theresa May also calls for stricter registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for fraud with immigration and privileges.
The option of requiring voters to produce an identity card before voting is under consideration.
Use ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their ballot paper to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks of the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Disengage political campaigners and activists from working with closed ballots and postal envelopes.
To give the police the power to set boundaries around polling stations.
Modify the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation, as presented in the 1983 People's Act.
Take illegal photography at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff force the voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric brutally assaults the city's police, claiming that it's “surprising” that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts,” he reported.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt, the criminal standard of proof, on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the inconclusive “check-outs” of the electoral offices of the city administrations.
Sir Eric said, "The previous court order in the Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacies as the mother of the parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some organs threaten this good reputation.
Crazy by the bicycle analogy of Kate and other celebrities of the Rio Olympics
The fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy about the French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who turned out to be very similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old member of the Olympics is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who can boast of her own famous doppelganger — at least, according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities that appear on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympics with more than a surface resemblance to the Hollywood Stars.
Hunter and wolf: member of the U.S. male archer team Brady Allison, on the left, was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid.
In addition to Kate's bicycle double, a lot of people online rushed to point out how a certain archer might be a twin of Leonardo DiCaprio's superstar.
A member of the U.S. male archer's team, Brady Allison, caused the storm on Twitter after the images of it, which looked frighteningly like a Wall Street wolf star.
And in fact, the archer found out about the madness of social media and admitted that he'd heard he'd been like Leo since he was a kid.
"I don't personally see a huge resemblance, maybe with the exception of the vegetation on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, is said to be an exact copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burga, Matthew Morrison had been compared to the star of Glee Club for many years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is the "sport version" of the actor "Start"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Raphael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
A silver medieval swimmer from Russia, Julius Efimov, can show off not only tanned skin and blonde hair like the actress Anna Lynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, according to fans, looks like "the sporting version of Joseph Gorgon Levitte."
Worse women: A football star, Hope Solo, on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter, from Dexter, on the right, have the same faces and eyes
Not the only one: one Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason that is the basis of the similar looks of this couple.
A Twitter user recently called the website to make public that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
In fact, the United States football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face-and-eye forms.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Lynnie, as well as the gold medal of Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful, wide smile, which is like the smile of the star "Make a Success" Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying "dead like a pig" about a Chinese swimmer.
Byron McDonald's analysis of the fourth place on the finish of the 14-year-old Ay Yanhan at the 4x200 m free-style women's estaphate relayed the CBC viewers in a live broadcast of the Olympics.
Canada's CBC broadcaster was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started like a stench" and "dead like a pig" during the voyage.
Commenting by Byron McDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's relay of 4x200 m in free style.
You could hear McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC commentator team to "feel it in color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a stench, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ay Yanhan, 14 years old, sailed the second stage of the 1 to 57.79 relay by 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rake, allowing Canadians to clear the gap from China.
Around Canada, the audience quickly reacted online after being shaken by the tone and the language used.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC speaker just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig?"?
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanhan from China in the finale of the 4x200 m women's relays in free style, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Twitter critic immediately struck Byron McDonald, and many urged him to fire.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Great #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who was running the CBC, apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, "We're sorry that the comment on the talk on the voyage was on the air."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
The SAF concluded by apologizing to over 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement
A friend of the commentator, Scott Russell, had to apologize on behalf of McDonald.
CBC then copied and sent their apology to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The network also rushed to apologise and publish the application.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to air.
Last night we acted quickly to apologise to our viewers live and to our followers on social media.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments related to the speech of the swimmer, not to her as a person.
Still, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think that his words would be interpreted as an attack on a person.
'I'd like to take this moment to apologise for the comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said at the CBC Olympics.
'I was talking about a swimmer's speech, not a personal one.'
'It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I'm sorry.'
The buyer, Primark, insulted a woman who shyly ate her underwear in the middle of the store.
The buyers didn't know where to look when some woman was naked to try on her panties, on the floor with the shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she tried on how she looked in them, pulled them off, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bowery Place shopping center in Falkland.
The Prymark shopping center of the Bowery Place in Falkland, where a woman had to try on the trictress panties before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of the two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that after the underwear was put on, the mystery woman again "dressed and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a pair of panties out of the window, took off her own panties and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a private place to do it -- she was just standing there, shameless."
"Everyone was staring when she took off her panties again, and she clearly didn't like them, because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing to the other three couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she liked to dress up again and went out.
"It doesn't look like she cared who was watching her, "or what she thought about the person who would eventually buy the panties that she was trying on."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson, from Kent, said, "I hate to think someone's gonna take home the panties that someone else was wearing, and they weren't washed."
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff was apparently trying to remove these items from the market after she left, and the better."
"I don't want to come home with a new pair of women's underpants and find out what another woman is wearing and taking them off, and they weren't washed."
A representative of Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that happened at our store in Faulxton on Tuesday, 9 August."

How to protect yourself from assaults with a gun, using a Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video from the Daily Mail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Misrachi, the master of the Federation of Krav Maga in New York, to find out how to deal with the armed robbers at close range.
Whether you come from the front or the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own gun.
If they're coming from behind, according to Misrachi, the first thing to do is to turn around so you can see the attacker and "free the line of fire."
Then you tighten the gun between your forearm and shoulder before you hit them in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee in the groin, and as the assailant bends off the pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with a gun, and back off, holding the gun pointed at him.
For an armed front, the way it works is to get your body out of the line of fire, get the gun fast and twist it so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and punch the assailant in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before you go back and aim at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video to see how Misrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery -- if you're not the master of the Krav Maga -- is to give your cash.
For a traveler, a traveler, Jan Wright, spends his language in the most filthy places in Europe
The British traveller put his immune system and vomit reflex to a serious test, licking some of the most filthy and abhorrent places in Europe.
The lead and author of travel books, Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spent his language on the euro banknote, the Circus Piccadili railroads, the toilet flush button on the train, and the Russian public phone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is supposed to be a movie called "The Traveler-Lizoon's Guide to the Inner Power," has had some amazing results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of others may be extremely repugnant, but there are actually more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health-care professionals about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, none of the licked did bring him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for his intestine tests, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railing at the stations to the toilet flush button, this task has no doubt experienced his immune system.
In the film he made, he said, "I've been completely careless for my health since I was a kid, and I've been dragging a lot of stuff out of the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty Russian public toilet.
His test swab showed a luminometer of more than 4,000 units.
By comparison, the hands just washed must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after the value of his luminometer was over 4,000, while the newly washed hands show less than 60
Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio made a film on a traveler titled "Trainer-Lizoon's Guide to the Inner Power", which shows the number of bacteria in different places, for example, in the toilet.
In the movie, he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I've ever sniffed in the toilet. "
There's nothing more filthy than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The "Inner Power Traveler-Lizoon Guide" was taken off with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestines and to develop the immune system.
Senior Vice-President Valio for snacks, juices and new categories, Nico Wuorenmaa, said, 'We really wanted to offer the consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see, and at the same time might explain the value of the probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended up with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about food, we wanted to put it in a more context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health, and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we have been able to give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the film's director, added, "Let's say I'd lose my respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that the movie shows. "
Of course, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were pretty hard.
I'm glad we've been able to film some of these licks.
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of respondents linked acid bacteria exclusively to good stomach and intestinal conditions, while 58 per cent said that they used at least occasionally products containing added acid bacteria.
A family of bullies destroyed Saltash, the city home of Cornwall, on the evicted day.
A family of bullies left their municipal home with a loss of $50,000 after being evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilcock, were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forcibly evicted from the real estate, shocking housing cooperative officials found the real estate site in a state that needed to be repaired.
The walls had been left with shining holes, the floors had been opened, the trash had been scattered over the floor, and the walls had been tainted with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is supposed to live in a private apartment
Donna McAvoy, a landlord at Cornwall Houseing, said she was afraid that he would not be saved.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are a lot of things that need to be weighed, because this property is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys bad fame, and their name enjoys bad fame.
A couple of three sons, who had been living in a real estate site from time to time, and the police reported that the kingdom of the horror caused by the family had included bat-and-battling on the street, intimidating the people in the surrounding areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screams, disputes and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got a warrant for anti-social behavior in June.
In a number of rooms at the house, which might be cut off, they found the old trash.
The floorboards in the house where the drugs were sold in the past have been pulled out.
Neighbors say they saw the fights on the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Houseing forcibly evicted her and her partner this week, after having been granted an extended period of 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
The eviction was welcomed with relief by the neighbors, who said that their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care."
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'This morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet - we're not used to it!
Now that they've finally left, it's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of Cornwall Houseing, said that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and they called the police regularly
The trash and the old toys have been scattered down the green side of the city's house.
He added: 'It's a shame that the tenant was unable to accept any responsibility for the conduct of her and her family, because evicting is always the last method to be considered by Cornwall Houseing.
It was a very complex case, because the behavior was limitable, and their actions must have been horrifying to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police, and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will give a little comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that associative behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three of his sons lived in the house at different times, but he said that they were all a little over 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that surrounds the home.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, as well as weights, supplies and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he pleaded guilty to possessing Class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She claimed that the money went to pay for the tomb for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After making them homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the rooms in the house had been tainted with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they're gonna try to evict tenants who don't follow the lease rules.
Angela Crowe, of the Devon and Cornwall Police, said that the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to break the rules.
'This is a message to those who feel that they can act without charge to the prosecutor, as well as to those who are harmed by such conduct,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
The tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane almost touched the beach.
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to be shining in the sun were horrified for their lives
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk
This is a moment when fearful tourists start to panic, while a low-flying jet has spiked over a crowded beach.
Dramatic images show a military jet flying almost at a distance from the hunters on the sand strip to Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The resters jumped on their feet as they became, for obvious reasons, concerned with the noise of the aircraft's engines, but unable to see that they were moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the city of Aveira in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of a couple of vacationers who posted a video of a shocking passage on social media, said, "He flew very low twice, and there was a moment, at some point it seemed to break."
Nono Arroga added, "I was surfing, and I swear, it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
The tourists at Aveira Beach were horribly frightened when the plane showed up out of the mist and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion had been on a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast, and had to lower so low, as it was the only way to test them.
The pilot stated that the flight was a bit lower than normal due to the lack of visibility caused by the smoke from nearby burning forests, but the Air Force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and claimed the lives of four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today made a statement that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances of the dense mist and the smog from the forest fires, which made the appearance worse.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and the pilot was assigned to detect fishing boats as part of the mission
The HASSP system has been compulsory for over a year, but most restaurants and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Tests are increasing, and the business faces fines of up to 1 million roubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for food producers and transporters, as well as for general stores in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
In February 2015, Rostpresnaudzor began to test the business for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg.
But so far, the officials have only issued fines for certain violations of the rules (see “List of documents ...”).
A total of 600,000 roubles for the first offence and 1 million roubles for the second would be for failure to implement the regulations.
The HASSP, as a system that takes into account and prevents food risks, came up in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of food for the astronauts.
The system is now being used in all food plants, not just in the US, but in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating in the territory of the TS.
For the design and implementation of the system, the business was 4 years old (the HASSP requirement was introduced in the TC system in 2011).
Both businessmen and officials, however, recognize that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm concerns food production, not restaurants, as explained by the head of the Public Council, Elena Cereteli.
Now everyone's trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August and the beginning of September.
But they won't call for a big demand, because their target audience - families with children - is already getting ready for school, and experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the Government asking for permission of the charters now.
“For many Russian tourists, the question of the selection of quality and accessible seafaring is insurmountable, as most of the sites have already been booked by the end of September in the resorts of the Krasnodar region and the Republic of Crimea,” the authors of the letter note and stress that the opening of charter services in August will not have a significant impact on the already existing demand for Russian seafaring products.
As reported at the Northwest Regional Office of the Russian Union of the Touring Industry (RTU), in the event that the Russian and Turkish aviation agencies agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding, when the charters are resumed, is not yet in place, but depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, the planes can fly in September, even August, if the tour operators are quick to set up programmes and arrange with the airlines for the aircraft to fly,” says Pavel Rumentsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the Northwest Regional Office of the RST.
According to him, the possible renewal of the charters is good news, but it won't have a great impact on market power, because the main customers of the charter tour - families with children - have already returned from rest and are preparing for school or are taking vacations in other countries.
In the velvet season, tourings are mostly for single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously,” says Pavel Rumeensev.
"Turkish has a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it's about to offer a very budget offer - 50,000 to 60,000 roubles per tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, Director General of Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it's definitely not worth counting on. The bulk of the trips are already planned.
Pavel Rumentsev also believes that, since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, the charters will also be required, but there is no reason to wait.
"For Turkey, the launch of the charters now is the next season's rehearsal," says Pavel Rumeensev.
"Opening the charters to Turkey is good news for the next season," says Valeria Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the NDFL of statutory compensation payments, within the limits of the approved rules for compensation for injury or other health damage.
The award of milk to workers working in harmful working conditions is provided for in article 222 of the Criminal Code.
On the other hand, the rules and conditions for extradition are set out by order of the Ministry of Health and Development of the Russian Federation of 16 February 2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other equivalent foods is made to workers on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors in the workplace.
On the basis of the above-mentioned rules, the Russian FNL concluded in the letter under consideration that, on the basis of article 217, paragraph 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, incomes in the form of the cost of milk paid to employees on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions, in accordance with the rules and conditions approved by the Order of the Ministry of Health and Development of the Russian Federation of 16 February 2009 No. 45n.
The Moscow Gastrobank has not been licensed by the BC.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked a license to conduct banking operations with a credit organization.
According to the regulator, GASISBANC AOO had a high-risk credit policy to place money in low-quality assets.
An adequate risk assessment at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable presentation of the value of the bank's assets led to the credit organization's reasons for taking measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in questionable transit operations.
The bank has a provisional administration that is valid until the date of appointment to the tender manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive branch of the credit organization under federal law have been suspended.
AKB GASSTROYBANK is a member of the deposit insurance scheme.
It should be recalled that the payment of insurance compensation to bank depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Act No. 177-FZ, “On the insurance of natural persons' deposits in banks of the Russian Federation”, is provided for in the amount of 100 per cent of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total per investor.
Payments, according to the Treasurer, will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the records, the AKB AKB GUSSTROIBANK's assets as of 1 August 2016 ranked 335th in the Russian Federation's banking system.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIL died in Syria
Cadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, is said to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji stated that her family had learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died as a result of a Russian air strike in Raqqa, a compound of a group in the country, as ITV News reported on Thursday.
She was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she was planning to leave a war-torn country and return to England.
"We can only hope that the only advantage of all of this - like a tombstone and a will to others - is that these are the risks that are at stake in the war zone - to dissuade people from ever making the same choice," said Akunji.
In February 2015, the Sultan and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The family of the Sultans said that she had married an ISIL militant in Syria and had become a widow for a few months.
Reed claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the position of Chief Justice if elected
The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reed, says that he is convinced that the democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton will be nominating Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republicans of the Senate blocked Garland's claim, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The head of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next president will choose the man who will be able to replace the last Judge of the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reed announced at the conference call on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with some confidence."
Representative Reid later said that he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she was going to put up Garland, and was just putting up an idea.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to rock the boat with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reed claimed that the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are the "coachs" and "associates" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not the right man for the job.
Treats states that erotic calendars for 'female as well as for men'
The magazine "Treats" is working with photographer David Bellmer to produce a calendar for 2017, inspired by the Pierelli of the 1970s.
But instead of nude celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top-models for their calendar for 2017 with naked music.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy, because "Playboy is for men."
I'm making it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to go back to displaying a permanent and classic nude figure, where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," said Shaw in a press release declaring the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project, because it's a beautiful artwork.
Models can serve photos online or in the open casting in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will be given memos about unscrupulous Internet stores.
In Moscow, they're going to issue a memo that will tell us how not to become a victim of an Internet store.
It was reported in Rostpresnadzor, writing M24.
It is reported that government professionals are preparing a memo that will help citizens to select the Internet store and identify possible fraud patterns.
The concept of the brochure contains several sections.
This will be the general information and the legal framework, the rules on the delivery of goods, and the means to protect their legal rights.
The annex will make recommendations on how to correct the claim, and so on,” Rosseslavnadzor reported.
The note is currently being finalized.
It will then be made available on the Rostpresnadzor website in Moscow, and it is planned to produce a printed version and distribute it to Moscow.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia issued a statement in which it gave the name of the second suspect in the organization of the sabotage in Crimea.
Persons from Ukraine and Russia who had assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts had been detained.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Alexandrowicz and Zachtei Andrej Romanovic.
"All of them make a confession," states the communication.
A resident of the Zaporoz region, Yevgeny Panov, who had been detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, had previously pleaded guilty in an interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million roubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has ordered an administrative fine of 438 million roubles for the Google Corporation, which is on the website of the agency.
"The fine for Google for violating the antimonopoly law was 438 million roubles.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay the fine soon,” said the FAS Deputy Chief Alexei Dozenko.
In the course of the investigation, the FAS found that Google was supplying smartphone manufacturers that were sold in Russia to the Google Play application store only on the condition that other applications from the company were installed on the device.
These applications include a search engine to be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation is violating article 10, paragraph 1, of the FZ “Protection of Competition” (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the Russian mobile software market, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The Law “On the Protection of Competition” must be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, among them,” noted the Head of the Department of Communications and Information Technology of the Russian Federation, Helena Zaeva.
The agency suspects 16 Russian shops to conspire.
The New Books Network was fined for selling the book "50 Days Before My Suicide."
The New Books Network is fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 Days Before My Suicide," reports the City News Agency "Moscow".
The text of the book may be regarded as “provoking or provoking the suicidal behaviour of children and adolescents,” as reported in Rospiznadznadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine.
The Continent Regional Court confirmed a violation of the requirements for the distribution of information to children and ordered a fine for the confiscation of 49 copies of the printed material that had been arrested by the Rosmestnadzor Department.
The source in the New Books confirms that this is the work of Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookstores had been screened for the book 50 Days Before My Suicide.
There'll be a souvenir in Moscow for Ernst the Unknown.
There will be an evening in Moscow for the memory of the sculptor Ernst the Unknown, according to TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central House of Letters.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say good-bye to the Unknown in the United States in person.
Therefore, it was decided to arrange this evening for those who want to remember it in their home country,” the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress declared.
It noted that this is important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends all over the world.
Close friends of the Unknown were invited to the evening, including the poet Yevgeny Eutouchenko, the artist Boris Messerer, the president of the GMII, Pushkin Irina Antonov, the director of Mark Rosovsky, as well as the Russian Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinski, the head of the Moscow Department of Culture, Alexander Kibovski, and the Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Leonid Printnikov.
It has been previously reported that the relatives of Ernst the Unknown are planning to perform a sculptor service in New York, allegedly before 14 August.
The final consumer blamed: Who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men like vinyl.
And as long as you're not trying to cloak the comment section with rude insults under the alias of the Not All-Eleven Men of the Middle Ages, this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouTube, so much of the renaissance of the records is not due to the boom among the 2000s who want to penetrate a new material, but to the nostalgia of the middle-aged.
Those who recently bought the vinyl album are most likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to data.
Moreover, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely to be.
And it's not just an act of amateur gathering -- it's an emotional thing: the older buyers are more likely to keep their feelings (56% as opposed to 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% as opposed to 66%).
But are the YouTube results correct?
If this blog was a TV news report, the camera would have followed me while I was walking down the center of the lively Soho Street, in a humble gray suit, and violently gestured before the stop, putting my hands together and saying something impressive like, "Let's see."
All right, let's see.
While Soho's heart is slowly losing its charms and dirt — hotels, cafés, Paperchase shops are now full of buildings once occupied by independent vendors — a number of music stores with fantastic professionals are still in place.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these shops, and try to gauge their age and emotionality by observing.
A 55-year-old son of Glasgow Stewart, followed by me from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20 years old), London for half a day to meet, and go shopping for a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask.
"I suppose so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, as shown above (he e-mailed me a picture, I didn't follow him home), line up the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring so many albums and singles is partly from his disposable income: he can now buy records that he couldn't afford when they just got out, and buy out the items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of what I'm getting is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12, the things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
That's my drawback.
Wez, 25 years old, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouTube profile.
He did, however, observe a new wave of people under the influence of media outlets, people who had heard about their return and felt obliged to buy out their old records.
Judging from the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records,” he says.
This may explain the boom among renaissance figures for a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of records?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store, like Phonica, to realize that record stores offer comforting societies to people with similar views.
According to Ouez, some of the older clients, in particular, are offended by the cash-free pay system.
Some vinyl lovers may experience a shock from the digital world and prefer to go to the constants of familiar records envelopes, objects that awaken the memory of a quiet youth.
"I think that sometimes it might be filling a void or possessing material things as a sort of tranquillity," says Wes.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people do, too.
It's a simple way to keep your head occupied.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record shelves.
An ICM poll in April showed that almost 50 percent of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The poll also found that 41% had a player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl did not have a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I'd probably look seriously puzzled by gliving the shelves of Bosanowa's collections.
The "trofeal" aspect of the renaissance is what Johnny, 42 years old, observed at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
"I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf," he says.
It's not a high percentage, but it definitely happens.
More part of the product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger, not older, they're a little under 20, just getting to know it.
The Fopp, who is now taking almost the whole floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys, and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops — the last synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation — it is good to see the diversity of its clients.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to find a traumatic trauma 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleonor, 27 years old, had been on Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available on the market.
She's looking at the goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make a lot of money, she says, so it's not a good idea to collect records.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device - simple, but beauty vinyl is ... - it's immersed in dreams with a breath full of love.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl amateurs: City fashioners.
While I'm creating an illusion that I'm looking at the jeans of tight shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls coming around the Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter start talking about buying the Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase with the walls of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of modern styles and classics, binding records for any medium collection.
No one looks, perhaps because they're just ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "guilty vinyl."
But, given that any attraction to these items can mean more money to the industry and send a few clients to the Soho for a while, there's hardly anything to complain about.
Not surprisingly, a segment of the population that is more likely to have more time and money than most people have is the one that spends most of the money on luxuries, such as vinyl.
But as long as my findings show that YouTube's results are accurate, at least in Soho records stores, they don't rule out the huge number of female vinyl collectors and amateurs that exist in reality, in record stores, and online forums.
These people are probably working all the time in school or in the office.
But they clearly don't spend the morning of Thursday shopping records on Berwick Street, gliving the records, and avoiding the looks of an unpleasant 30-year-old false host who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland Polar Shark, the longest-lived vertebrae, is a video report
Scientists claim that a green polar shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, states that the record is 272 to 512 years old and 5 meters long.
The French court rejects the offer to demolish shops in the jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer of the Calais to demolished dozens of home-made shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At this week's court hearings, the Calais authorities have said that the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 home-made shops, where people in the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40 p) or the simplest dishes for a few euro in home-made restaurants.
The Prefecture of Calais has said that these sites must be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and health risks.
Humanitarian groups had told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, arguing that the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing number in the camp.
They said that home-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court held that there was no legal reason to expel the people running 72 home-made shops, but stated that the problems of the Calais prefecture “were fully understood”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that shops, cafés and restaurants played a much more important role than just feeding people who "live in a very delicate environment."
He said that the spaces provided a quiet meeting point for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites at risk of demolition was the Children ' s Café Jungle Book at the camp, which does not work for profit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes, and shelter counselling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's café.
A letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closure “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not older than eight years of age”.
Two charities, Helping the Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday, estimated that the number of people in the jungle camp had increased to more than 9,000, the highest in history, after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Neighbourhood libraries invite young freemen to educational programs.
This week, the Philial Libraries will hold meetings dedicated to City Day, the Year of the Russian Film, and even the Day of the Physician.
The programs are geared to the children's audience, so they're going to be in play format for the most part.
Today, August 10th, philial library No. 2, in the linen neighborhood, invites to the cruise presentation "My Town is Small."
August 11th, in the Library of Philial No. 1 is going to be the time of the country: "I live in this city, I know this city."
There will be a multimedia class on the same day at the Library of Philial No. 2 "Lands of Homeland Past Destiny".
And in the Philial Library No. 4 in Surazovka, it's a game program called "The Film, the Film, the Film."
On Sunday, August 14th, for the boys in the northern neighborhood, the Philial Library 3 will host a game program called "Physcult-Hello!"
Britain stops at the silver in rugby 7 after Fiji's master class lets them take the gold.
The impressive British series in Rigby 7 was overwhelmingly halted at the final block of Fiji's team in the finals on Thursday night, when they were completely defeated by 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in ball ownership, dispersal, evasion, support for the game, line running, and brute power to win the gold, their first Olympic medal of any color.
The fall came with not too poor comfort in the form of silver, the third in Britain in a day, and they could be proud of their efforts at the first Rigby 7 Olympic tournament, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated along the way.
The ill beat-up of Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier that day, might have come back to have a negative effect on them in the finals.
But, no matter what, Fiji, in this form, won the best team of 15 men.
This may be some consolation for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British man will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s Chief Coach, Ben Ryan, the former Chief of England from Wimbledon.
It was a bit of a trip for the United Kingdom.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
Here they only lost one.
These blows will cause pain, but the progress is remarkable.
Fiji had begun a great start for fun by kicking off the British try to catch the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and World Series Champions went up 5-0 when Ocea Collinisau dived in a corner.
With four minutes on the watch, Gerryr Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank, which was realized.
12-0 and Great Britain barely touched the ball.
The grand attempt to intercede Mitchell held the man-mounter Leon Nakarawa from putting down the third, but it just held Fiji back.
At the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and the British lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption and on the watch was still more than a minute ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovovo then broke through a few more sluggish attempts to intercept the British and stormed the line to get a point.
The implementation led to 29-0 in the break.
It looks like Fiji was born to play rugby 7, while the UK is still mastering the arts.
Which is, to a large extent, the case.
The United Kingdom was making mass replacements for half the game, and they blocked the Fiji Dam... for all four minutes, which was good for the first half, until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton took an attempt for the United Kingdom, making a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game had long been on the way to the South Sea Islanders, whose fans had been singing, waving flags and dancing on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of Fiji's approach.
Mata William decorated the Fijian cake, which did not need to be decorated, with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-finals, and the United Kingdom had slightly overtaken South Africa in an intense semi-final attempt by all, the difference between the British implementation.
Kyle Brown brings the Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great work of his feet, broke the line and beat it under the beams in the second half.
The glamorous last attempt to intercept Marcus Watson, a 15-year-old brother to the British team, Anthony, won, and eventually won a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the coach's rooster against cancer.
There will be no more thrilling gold at these games, and that's something to say.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy climbs to history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an added value of their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two that pulled the oars, there were three voices in the boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always as long as they hunted for the second in a row of Olympic Gold in the women's couples, the first women in the British annals who had reached that height.
Their supremacy was absolute, in the end it was their 39th unfailing speech, again unprecedented.
What we see is that the two shiny athletes, slipping over the surface with the elegantness of the swans, do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind each gold roared the ready-handed battalion, contributing to the gradually growing victories that are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of the coach, who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see the day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, it goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a bit of a change of looks for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio's lucky to have started treatment in early 2014 in the inter-season, keeping the gap minimal, if that might be the right expression in circumstances like this.
I needed to get paid, so I needed to get better fast.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the station -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, even though they said that there were enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The eye itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bit more.
The moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent the nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own feelings.
Stanning, the captain of an artillery regiment with a service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a bit too much, but it means so much."
It just proves how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you so much to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
This couple is setting a stressful beat that their competitors could never match.
Even at the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark's teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much to spare.
We've been in a lot of phase.
Helen called out, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Right now, it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We weren't waiting for fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to get out and win this race, which we did.
It's gonna take a year for a couple to figure out their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, at her own with a TV adventurer, Steve Beckshall.
Right now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I had become the Olympic Champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better,' she said.
The Government extended the destruction of the sanctions products
The Government has extended until the end of 2017 the deadline for the destruction of food prohibited for entry to Russia.
The decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against the countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was imposed in August 2014.
The ban has since been extended on a number of occasions, and is now in force until December 31, 2017.
Russia is not allowed to import some agricultural, raw and food products from the US, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and dairy products have been banned.
Recycling of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been under way in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of illicit products had been removed from the market.
Hunting for "prohibited"
Rains and storms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
There will be an atmospheric front across the metropolitan region that will bring precipitation and lower the temperature of the air.
The air will warm up to 25 degrees in the daytime.
For example, on the night of Saturday in Moscow, there will be short-term rains, storms and storms of up to 15 m/s.
It is expected to rain during the day with storms and winds up to 12 to 17 m/s.
Rains with storms are also predicted in Orlov, Kur and Voronesh oblasts, reporting "Days.ru".
Next week, the rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO Arbitrator Panel found that Russian import duties on paper, fridges and palm oil ran counter to the rules of the organization.
Import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia upon accession to the WTO.
“This is the first time the WTO has taken a decision against the Russian Federation,” says the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their opinion that the EU had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures “were systematic” or “comprehensible”.
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt import duties to paper and fridges in the near future.
This is stated in the report of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kyiv intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia's actions, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that US conduct in resolving controversial issues in the WTO undermines the organization's principles of discussion.
Brazil, Japan, the European Union, and other members of the WTO made a similar statement because Americans refused to approve South Korean Judge Chan Song Hwa for a second term.
Therefore, Russia will not go to the WTO on the question of Western sanctions against the Russian Federation.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now made up of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The president's office has been replaced by a head
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, appointed former Deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Wyno as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin has reorganized the presidency and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Wyno stated during the meeting that he considered the anti-corruption work that he had begun to carry out as head of the administration of President Ivanov and that he had pledged to cooperate with the Government.
In the past, Ivvestia had written that experts considered the resignation of Sergei Ivanov as the head of the administration to be transparent and understandable, and that reshuffling would not fundamentally change the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head of the president's office, who had been in the office for a long time, has effectively built up the work of the AP.
He was replaced by the Deputy Chief of Administration, Anton Vine, a man who is well aware of the specifics of this work.
In Poland, it is assumed that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The State-owned oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it due to the redirection of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Bogoslav Majec.
His words go to the TASS.
"Maybe it's happening that we're not going to buy any gas at Gazprom, we're now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be the East, the raw materials from LNG-terminals and Norway,” said Majetz.
Gazprom is currently dominant in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had delivered almost 5.3 billion m2 of gas in the first half of 2016, 30 per cent above the 2015 level.
The share of the Russian gas giant in the procurement of PGNIG rose to 49.8 per cent, compared to 40 per cent a year earlier.
On 22 July, the Polish Antimonopoly Authority did not agree on the establishment of a joint venture, Gazprom, and its European partners in the construction of the North Flow-2 Gas Pipeline.
This month, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion m2 of gas to North Flow-2.
Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Holding Board, said.
The North Flow-2 power auction will take place in 2017, and the auction is scheduled to take place in the fall of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action in connection with the intention of the Polish party to withdraw long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, and Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Board of the Company, said.
He recalled that, in the first quarter of the year, Poles had only increased by 42 per cent the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation.
The deputy of Gazprom added that the mere fact that a Polish PGNIG application had been filed with the Stockholm Court of Arbitration did not mean that the negotiations had been terminated.
The Polish company had previously gone to the court to bring down the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall that the Polish Government's Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter of Naimsky, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
The contract between Poland and Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter of Naimsky, stated that his country, in six years, could refuse to supply blue fuel from the east.
He said that Warsaw was planning to construct a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas, Baltic Pipe, which would connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
North Flow-2 provides for the construction of two strands of a sea gas pipeline with a combined capacity of 55 billion m2 of gas per year from Russia to the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the Ukraine ' s border with Crimea.
Alexander Hug, the first head of the SMS in Ukraine, reported this.
"I can confirm that the SMS has increased the number of observers in this field," he said, in answer to a question from the journalists, he is transmitting the RIA News.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm, and there are no security incidents.
Observers monitored what was happening at three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a passenger jet, Yak-42, landed at Ufa Airport on the Internet, rolled out of the airstrip by 400 metres and crashed on the left wing.
The video was released by "360".
The emergency occurred at 4:30 in Moscow time.
The flight of the Airlines Krasavia arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to a parking lot.
Ufa Airport is operating in normal mode.
The Civil Investigation Department of the RPCR has been investigating the reason for the heavy landing of the aircraft.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stephan de Mistura, believes that the fact is incontrovertible.
Such statements had been made on the eve of the third round of the inter-Syrian talks, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have begun to investigate reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
First information on the toxic gas attack, suspected to be chlorine, was available on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition stated that in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, the aircraft had dropped the poisonous bomb, but in Moscow the charges had been called a bomb.
The Russian Ministry of Defence later accused the opposition group Harakyat Noor al-Din al-Zinki of the incident.
Soon it was reported that the toxic-gas bombs were two.
This was confirmed by BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I smelled gas, started to burn my eyes, it was hard to breathe," quotes the word of an eyewitness.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people died, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be considered a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said to the reporters, "The evidence that this really happened is a lot."
The non-use of chlorine for military purposes is prescribed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
While all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo complicates the daily shelling of its districts, while terrorists prevent the population from moving out of the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations is waiting for Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in military action.
The organization's current three-hour daily tranquillity regime is considered “not enough to help the nearly 2 million civilians trapped”.
Staffan de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to deliver relief and evacuate the sick and wounded to the city every week.
“We have to send bulk cargo from a convoy of trucks to a place where roads are virtually destroyed and those left are mined,” said Mr. Egeland. “But the Russian delegation has confirmed its willingness to sit with us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue in Geneva.
How Russia opened the "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second-largest Syrian city, Russia announced on 11 August the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities regime, which will be in effect daily from Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is designed to provide the conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was taken against the background of the growing international pressure on Moscow to halt the military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
Four people were killed in a series of bombings in the resorts of Thailand.
Immediately, a number of explosions took place in south Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people died in the attack, 19 were injured.
The explosion epicenter hit the city of Hua-Hin.
Among the victims were 10 foreigners, four nationals, and no Russians.
No terrorist groups had yet taken responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs had rushed to state that Islamists had not been involved in the incident.
A number of people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the bombings.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and nature of the bombings indicated that they had been directed against the country ' s leaders.
Attacks took place in popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the area of Phuket and in the cities of Hua Hin, Thrang and Surat Tani.
Since the arrival of the military junta in the country in 2014, economic growth has fallen from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism has remained one of the few sectors that have shown development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, an increase of 1.5 million over the 2015 figure.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been apprehended, as reported by police colonel Krisana Patancharoen.
It was too early to speak of the objectives, he added, but in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the country “is sure that they are not linked to international extremist groups”.
It is too early to draw conclusions,' said Mr. Patancharoen.
But we know that these incidents are not directly linked to any kind of terrorism, in fact, they are local subversions, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The bombings occurred on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely to target it.
According to the General of the Sithichi Srisopacharoenrat Police, the bombs were exploded remotely, with a half an hour apart.
They were hidden inside the trees in lively streets filled with restaurant-dressing tourists.
It is well known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who was selling street food.
The identity of the remaining victims is not yet known, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, four of them are German, three Dutch, two Italian, and an Austrian.
There are no Russians among the victims of the bombings, and Rostourism's press service reported.
The local experts also linked the bombings to the referendum held on 7 August, in which 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution-making commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role to play in the election of the country ' s Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the parliamentary elections of 2017.
On 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the Commander of the Army of the country, Praut Chang-Ouch.
To that end, he said, the army had fuelled the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military set up the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, dispersed protesters and the upper House of Parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Thai Government, led by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
As in Bangkok, there were two explosions.
In January 2014, in the centre of Bangkok, at the Monument of Victory, where a major protest took place, there were two blasts that affected 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The blasts caused unknown motorbikes.
The authorities reinforced security measures in the capital and engaged the military to protect the protesters.
The development of conditions has begun in Dry Loga.
According to OS, the Government was asked to agree on the draft terms of the gold-mining auction for the Dry Logh, while maintaining two key limits.
It is proposed that the auction should not allow a company with 25 per cent or more of the foreigner's property and those applicants whose capital will not have a minimum of 25 per cent of the State's participation.
The industry does not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are not at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August, and it can be held in October.
The Ministry of Nature has submitted a draft order and conditions for the auction to the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, Dry Log (Irkutsk Region, Reserves and Resources - 130 million ounces), and has told two sources of OS, familiar with the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, and one of them is clarified.
In the Ministry of Nature, it was confirmed that the project had been submitted to the government.
Alexander Cloponin's vice-president's representative said, "OK," that the project had not yet entered the office.
“An auction may be announced in August, as soon as the Government order is issued, and given the time limit for the solicitation of bids by potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender may take place in October,” said the Ministry of Nature.
According to OS, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as set out in the version, which was sent to the ministries and FOIVs in July (there is an OS).
The first is the presence of at least 25 per cent of public participation in capital.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on an understanding of FM-57 on foreign investment in strategic societies.
According to the two articles mentioned in the draft, the FS, as already written “OJ” on 2 August, may not be allowed to auction by companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent or more) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, as Dry Log is a federal subsoil (over 50 tons of gold).
In the Ministry of Nature, the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies” but refused to comment on the details prior to the Government's order.
The demand for public participation in the auction was put forward by Irkutsk oblast, said "OK" in December 2015 in the Ministry of Nature, and later confirmed by the Governor of the Region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, who had “investment agreements with Rostech”.
Those who have lobbyed for the ban on the admission of foreigners do not specify the "OZ" interlocutors.
"But it's in the spirit of time: not to hand over control in Russia's largest gold field against the background of Western sanctions," he reasoned with the "OZ," who is familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The Head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergey Donskaya, stated on 1 August that foreigners “can go to the consortium” if the applicants involve them “as financial entities, as technological partners”.
The interviewees think it's unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
A consortium of the largest gold miner, the Pole, under the control of the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rostech, is considered the main contender in the industry.
In July, the partners created the SP "SL Gold", where the Pole had 51% shares, and the RT-GR structure had 49%.
In Rostech, they refused to comment, in the Pole, they said "OW" that "unquestionably, they are interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competences and resources to develop it.
“But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the declaration of the terms,” was added to the Pole.
AFROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision of the Russian government was said by the sources to "OH".
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which are developing assets in Chukotka, claimed to be able to participate in the development of the Dry Loga, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to OS, are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Union of Gold Industries of the Russian Federation, Sergey Kashuba, estimated the “OK” investment in the Dry Logs at $2.5 to $4 billion.
Most of the potential bidders discourage not only the volume of the investment but also the complexity of the project: the need for serious exploration of the reserves and technologies for complex ores is explained by the industry's "OO" interlocutors.
On the pension market, the largest M&A deal, the "KIT Finance Pension Administrator", started the process of merging the four controlled NPFs.
As a result, a NPF of about 373 billion roubles will be established on the basis of the Pension Fund.
The introduction of the process of merging the four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promagrophon, Legacy and Gazfund Pension Savings - was announced by the owner of 100 per cent of the KIT Funds by the Pension Administrator.
“The reorganization shall be carried out in agreement with the CB, subject to the requirement that the terms of the contracts in force shall not be eroded,” the company's report states.
The association is based on the Pension Fund.
According to the CEO of the NPF, Oleg Bialošiski, the pooling of funds addresses a number of challenges: expanding the geography of presence, focusing resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds, and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the target date for the completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF, the Pension Fund will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As at 31 March, the pooled fund ' s pension savings exceeded 373 billion roubles.
According to the records on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of the Fund's owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (65 per cent under the control of the DOS) and the Gazfund NPF (35 per cent).
However, the group itself started much later the competitors.
For example, the "The Future" group under the control of the O1 NPF had swallowed the "Stalford" earlier this year.
The joint NPF is currently joining the Uralcib Foundation and the Russian Standard.
“Unification in a single structure, in addition to cost reduction, is necessary to meet the structural challenges,” notes the Director of the NPF, “The Future”, Nikolai Sidorov.
The Safmar-NPF “European”, “Education and Science” and “Region Fund” have been actively working on the consolidation of funds since April and should be integrated into the Safmar NPF by the end of the current year.
In 2017, the NPF "Trust" will join them.
“The pooling of funds will have the effect of increasing control over risk, operations and costs,” noted in the Safmar pension group.
The pause in the pooling of funds that KIT The Pension Administrator's Finance has endured may be due to a number of reasons, the experts indicate.
Until recently, NPFs had not been able to buy more than 40 per cent of the volume of infrastructural bonds in which the group was actively placed.
Since the amendment of the CB regulation in March this year, there are no more such restrictions for a number of issuers meeting the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, the whole issue can buy out one major player,” states the Director of the AKRA Financial Institutes Rating Group, Yuri Nogin.
A number of NPF managers from top 15 on assets refer to a further possible reason for the pause as the division of areas of influence and, as a result, to be agreed upon by the group's owners in a single fund.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment.
Nor did the "OO" request to the NPF "Gasfund" answer.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and inexpensive exercise, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
As Sergey Ocolesnov, the CEO of the consulting company Pension Partner, notes, the Gaz Fund for Pension Savings has less outflows, the accession will stabilize the base of the group's other funds.
In doing so, the better experience of the NPF, KIT Finance, and the Promagrophony, will be needed in the construction of the retail sales of the OPS, as well as in the use of more modern software.
The CB's demands on the NPF's processes and human resources are on the rise, so it is not appropriate to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, and Paul Mitrofanov, the corporate rating manager, considers the "Expert RA" expert.
“The effect of a reduction in duplicative functions will clearly overshadow the possible costs of merging,” observes Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of the pooling of four funds, Sergey Ocolesnov, is estimated to be 30 to 50 million roubles.
“The cost of four funds of this size is about 400 million roubles a year, with the medium-term consolidation of the budget actually halved,” Mr. Ocolesnov is sure.
The best Disney movie, "Pete and his dragon", was released in Russia.
New Zealand's beautiful species, a gratifying dragon, a persuasive history, and country-style songs are enough to rethink old-fashioned magic, according to YELEN CRAWSON.
The frightened little boy was picked up by a dragon, who became a human baby, a tender nanny, and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his buddy Eliot, after a puppy in a fairy tale book, plays catch-up with him, and sleeps in a hug.
Six years later, when he was thrown in the hedge bandage, he was no longer distinguished from the other intelligent forest heap, Mowgli.
That's how Pete finds Grace's red-haired female herder (Brace Dallas Howard), while Gavin's team (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively wringing the forest.
Now, not only is she going to have to believe in the existence of the dragon, but she's going to have to help save it.
Pete is in a fast-track course of being human in an idyllic American environment that wears shirts, a moral code in the heart, and smiles more glamorous than any ad.
No character looks or works too bad for a viewer to really hate or fear it.
Even Gavin, who discovered the hunt for an atypical forest owner, is far from a permanent villain.
The huge, furry dragon also turned out to be quite not scary, with the good face of the bulldog, the airship's wingspan, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is funny, squealing, even whimpering, and, luckily, he doesn't say, but he's always wanting to iron it, and it's very different from all the famous movie dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his way of holding is such a high degree of emotional engagement that, at the most stressful moments, weeping in three streams, not just small viewers, but also adults.
Amazingly good and young Oaks Figley in the role of Pete, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtually gives out a canonical grandpa who would love to have literally every child.
How did the director David Lowry manage to make a fantasticly sweet remake of the lost Disney film "Dracon Pete" of 1977, mediocrely from the nose to the tip of his tail, memorized by a mix of animations and a game movie, and make it the most mental movie this summer?
It's just a miracle that helped.
In his picture, Lowry, in fact, took only two things from the original: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There's music numbers and most of the funny jokes.
This fairy tale reads the traits borrowed from "Bambi", "Alternate" and many other sweet-hearted children's paintings.
Disney continues to successfully expand the Gallery of High-quality Remakes of the 21st Century.
Of course, "Pete and the Dragon" is not as stunningly beautiful as "The Book of the Jungle," and it doesn't have the skillful villain that Kate Blanchett turned out to be a stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive movie is no less successful in believing in wonders and good in the best Disney tradition.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magic castle, Director Lowry, will be given again for the art adaptation of the "Peter Pane" story.
In "Pete and His Dragon" in tandem, David Lowry and writer Toby Halbrooks entered a new ambitious project on a non-adulting boy in a single-named James Barry fairy tale.
RBK journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged with a new charge
The lawyers of RBK journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of an extremist structure, stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had found shortcomings in the case of their client.
We learned from the investigators that the Public Prosecutor's Office made this presentation just yesterday.
We had scheduled to attend a court hearing on the limitation of access to the criminal case file, but the proceedings did not take place, and the investigators informed us of the presentation made by the Public Prosecutor's Office,” RBK quoted counsel Olga Dinze.
She said that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated to the investigators that there was a lack of competence in the case and the material collected.
Now the investigators will have to fill the gap in the evidence and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CPC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarifies.
Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015 as reported by OS.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation had excluded the RBK journalist from the charge the language of “destroying the political situation towards instability” and “disruption of power by illegal means”.
Aleksandre ZILBERT, a correspondent of Commersant Boscosport, lived in the Olympic village, inspected the home of the Russian team, lunched in the local dining room, and even passed the WADA test.
I don't think life's dying for a second.
Even at night.
The final launches sometimes end at midnight, after which the athletes need an hour and a half to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, there is an unchecked settlement and eviction from the village, as some athletes complete their performances and leave Brazil, while some are just coming here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations are stretched out in one of the time shadows.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some of the operational household issues, as the head of the Russian Olympic team's sports delegation, Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which ours are stationed is a model one of the first to be put into service and to be shown to all the inspecters, even in it there are some shortcomings.
It's a hot water problem, so I'm sorry, toilets.
We've been fighting for a long time to be clean.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinders started to come, but they just put some stuff on the floor, that's all.
The floors are, you see, kind of innovative.
Like, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these floors - common laminate!
So, we got a shift in the Clining Company, and now it's OK.
The Olympic village is such a South Butnov, a dormitory area, fenced on one side of the mountains, and on the other, a huge effluent, with water spilled.
And for the sake of reliability, there is still a two-metre iron fence, along which the machines walk.
A total of up to 17,000 people can be accommodated in the village in 3,604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-story buildings is a huge Russian flag, which is a home that is completely allocated to the needs of our team.
When you look at the small lobby at the entrance, you can immediately determine which problems seem to be the most pressing for the national team.
There are two ads at the check-in: the print "Please don't drop the paper in the toilet!" and the hand-held "I'll get the badges.
The bar itself drowns in the tracts.
Their fun color contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "A Remembrance on Infectious Diseases for Going to Rio de Janeiro", "First Help in drowning, Abortion of the Body in the Breathing Pathways, Loss of the mind - Phases of Cardiovascular Reanimation", "First Help in Burns, Heat Shots, Breaks, and Brights".
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: "Infectation is accompanied by fever and subsequent recovery.
However, not all will have a good outcome.
Of course, the Russian team has a health centre that is available at any time to assist the people of the home in a skilled way, including a relaxing and sporting massage.
On the contrary, the health centre is the very headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspirational poster, "No matter what, we're gonna win!"
And, of course, verse:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Even less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not give up, it will not break!
And for even more uplifting, there is an ad: "Dear brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia Kirille, the protojee Andrey Vladimirovich Alexeyev is responsible for the spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team.
You can order a prayer and other requests by phone...
In general, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Ceremonies for all faiths in the countryside.
And the Russians, in a privileged position, they have their own chapel.
Because of the lift load from the ninth to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the staircase recommended for use in the fire.
And in the dark tripped over the bodies on it.
Apparently, it was the sleeper staff of the new Clining Company.
I suppose at any time they're ready to start washing innovative genders, they've decided to set themselves up a quiet time right at the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was expected to meet a long-time friend, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, a coach of our tramps, who led them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and the European champ, Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
We live in two, and the beds, of course, are almost tacit, but it's not critical.
It's one on four, but it's spacious.
The cupboard, of course, is funny, from the fabric, is not trustworthy, but something can be put down.
"No, you're pretending they're out of tea!" the tennis player Svetlan Kuznetsov, whom I met in the main dining room.
Its main name is at least because it is a space of 2,700 square metres and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There's 60,000 servings a day at the top of the table, free of charge.
The menu options are "Brasil's best", "World's Kitchen", "Asia's dishes" and "Pizza, pasta."
The last option, as I was looking at, is very popular with our volleyballers.
And let's say I didn't find any soups in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
What kind of soup is that?
It's a good thing I've taken Chinese with me.
And a kettle.
But in fact, just so you know, we've got worse food on our court.
There's something you can choose, despite unbearable homogeneity.
I personally picked the cod for the couple and the meatballs in the tomato sauce.
A tablet with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, as well as the food value of the product and the availability of allergists, is placed next to each dish.
Well, well, I'm telling you, it was edible.
I don't even know why this line is always at the local McDonald's.
We have our best friends, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), who are well-equipped, relaxed, can be said to be warm athletes on the way out of the restaurant.
They're lured by a smart quiz, the winner of which is getting a T-shirt.
Provocation, you can say!
To get a gift, you have to answer at least eight out of ten correct questions.
I've got questions in Russian! - I've been attacked by a WADA girl.
But the wrong man was attacked.
So I'm in a patriotic rush, naturally.
The situation has become more acute on the second question: "If I have been notified of doping control, do I have to go to the doping control point immediately?"
I'm on option B, "No, I've got one hour."
Lost, so to speak, my guard.
I've forgotten that the WADA can't wait to relax.
Anyway, we need to show up right away.
And in the seventh stage of the quiz, my position was very critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I find it hard to keep a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and by the way, it's hard for me to!), I could use bio-additions to get "additional nutrients to increase my productivity."
No, they won't!
In fact, the answer is worded in a way that categorically does not prohibit, but is strongly discouraged in a number of sentences.
It's not fair to play this WADA!
How's it going, Russia? - The lead quiz asks a mockery.
There's no backing back, behind Ephesus, Isinbayev, and our entire bloodless team.
So I focused, and I won a poor shirt out of the blue.
Know what they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I went to the fitness center next door.
I'm into the math of the simulators.
It's 250.
He was surprised to note that no Russian athletes had been found in this set of trails.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let the one who can't play train!
And here's a guy in a nearby health centre.
In line for the eye doctor.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the health centre, as in the whole village, there is a condom machine.
On it is an enlightening call, "Continue with the condom."
The next thing to do is to twist a iron that looks like a door lock, and a condom made of natural latex in the Amazon is ready to drop out of the machine.
I've got one to remember.
Athletes don't get away with it. 450,000 of them have been brought in.
There is a whole entertainment center for the festival and festival in the Olympic village.
There's an inquisitorial plaque next to it, recalling that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day in various ways on athletes.
The center is flooded with video games, pool and tennis tables, board football and hockey, and some kind of strange device that looks like video apps.
What is this? - I'm interested in a fellow in the form of a Ukrainian team that is actively using a wild toy.
You could, of course, just say you don't want to talk to a man in the form of a Russian team, that's all.
Here, by the way, there's some kind of strange confluence in the eyes of the guys in yellow-blue.
The most playful team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the village by looking at every corner of the village.
But if you're walking, instead of driving electric carts, you're going to open up the home of the Canadian team with the salmon at the entrance and the tent with the resting bath, the ticket office, the laundry, the dry cleaning, the barbershop, the flower shop, the day-to-day shop, and the post office with the unique stamps (only you can't wait out of the queue from the Chinese philatelicists), the bank, the Bureau of Recoveries, and the Photoshop.
And late in the evening, you will sit by the olive tree, shackled with colored ribbons, in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who have left this world.
And you're going to be under a machine that dispersally sprays the insect-killing fluid, thinking about the eternal.
I mean, the Olympics.
Which doesn't stop for a moment in this village.
While the rest of the Russian world was holding its breath as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Not a lot of people know, the news that Inna Deriveau won the gold at the XXXI Olympics was first.
Maybe I'm the only one in Moscow who's ever seen it happen -- apart from the ones who, of course, watched the competition at Carioca that night.
Only a real fan can understand that.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors at the bottom - as always by 1:00 a.m. - wake up and start to scream at each other in a ruthless, but very loud way.
And it's threatening to move the furniture.
There's a crane running in the kitchen. There's no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
It's not clear in the TV calendar, so I was just keeping the "Mitch", "First" and "Russia" in check, even though it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is the home of repetitives, all the sport is in the record for some reason.
There's a live show.
The hope is, of course, on the "Mitch" - the whole evening a young man in the news was yelling at first about the great semi-final of Deri-Shanaev, then about the coming fight for the gold.
It'd make sense to show you.
But instead, basketball is the US-Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half won.
Put the Americans in the spot of their own greatness.
The result was lost, but, as is now said, the Olympic basketball tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but the fight with Dee Francesca is coming, and there's no change on the screen.
In a simple panic, I'm starting to send out channels.
It's like it's the second time in a row.
All right, let's go down to the cables.
None of Match's thematic fencing.
Oh, I feel like the fight's about to begin.
I don't like texting and tweeting some sporting sites.
Sudden surfing produces an unexpected but shiny result.
On the website "First", it turns out that all the competitions that take place at this point in time are aired directly.
I'm calling for the fencing, I'm getting a fight for the gold.
Deri-eye is a perfect counterattack, goes up the sunglasses - and is obviously starting to take time.
The Italian woman is playing almost the whole part.
Ours is one point ahead, a little more than two seconds to the end.
Dee Francesca jumps on Deri-eye, it backs off, the time is running out, the Italian is injecting.
Victory!
In a couple of seconds, the Olympic Messenger on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
So I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, faithful, involved.
The Muslim Religious Authority (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM Plenum ordered its imams to perform Friday's sermons only in Tatar to make the young Tartar learn their native language.
The Office states that this “does not in any way interfere” with the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani complains that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60 per cent of the parishioners, including foreign students, migrants, and the Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons will not reach the entire audience in the Tatar.
Yesterday, the plenary of the DUM Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic in the Tatar language only.
As Tatarstan's mufti Kamil Samigullin has said, this should be an incentive for young Tartars to learn their native language.
"For those who say "heavy," in every big mosque, we intend to organize classes in the Tatar language at no cost," promised Mr. Samigullin.
He added that “the decision has already come into effect” and today, in all the mosques of the sermon, “must be in the Tatar language”.
He recalled that the DUM Tartarstan publishes a magazine called Sura, with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
The imam, who is not good enough to speak Tatar, "can be well prepared for it."
DUM Tartarstan has more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to the Mufti, in the districts of Friday, the sermons are held exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques had previously been used mainly in Russian.
In particular, as the Mufti pointed out, this was practiced at the Burneyev Mosque, Zacabanna and Enilaire.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed that the purpose of the management is to ensure that all students possess the two national languages of the Republic, irrespective of nationality.
“No harm can be said to Netar Muslims,” Mr. Muhammetshin pointed out, explaining that the sermon itself is “not compulsory, the main part of the prayer”.
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to read in Arabic, and the mosques will continue to have lectures and lessons in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "OJ" that there was no serious threat of the banishment of the Tatar language from the mosques.
Other than Russian and Tatar, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in the Republic ' s s sermons.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatar (WCT).
The head of the WCT Executive Department, Rinat Zakrov, said, "OK," "Meceti are an important part of our national life."
It would be unfortunate if the Tatar language had left the field.
He pointed out that the preaching in Tatar is “the will of the imams themselves,” but in the exposition of the VCT, “they consider it to be the right thing to do”.
The imams interviewed, who preached in Russian, are ready to implement the decision of the DUM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulty understanding the clergy.
Both the Tartars and the Russians go to the mosque.
A lot of people don't understand the language.
They're gonna be a little tight, of course.
"We have to reconfigure," says the Imam of the Burneyev Mosque, Farhat Mavlettin.
According to him, the Russian sermons are even closer to many Tatars, since “the Russians are in schools, in kindergartens, in radio stations, everywhere in the first place”.
However, he believed that the mosque would be able to continue its classes and lectures in Russian, which were held on other days.
We trust in God.
Allah will show you a way out of this," he concluded.
But about 60% of us don't know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
There's a lot of foreign students coming to us: Africans, Arabs.
"So we've been in Russian for four years," says the imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language the sermon will “go to a narrower circle and not reach the entire audience”.
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
Just the result of the sermons will be different.
But time will.
"For example, it's only easier for me, because the Tatar language is my native language," concluded Gabdulla Galiullin.
Former Director of FSIN was brought to trial
The Moscow Public Prosecutor ' s Office upheld the indictment in the criminal case of theft of the budget allocated to the Russian Federation FSIN, which had been investigated by the SCR.
Alexander Reimer, an ex-chief of the prison department, and his deputy, will appear before the court, causing more than 2.7 billion roubles to the FSIN.
The Metropolitan Public Prosecutor's Office sent a criminal case to the Zamovoret Rice Court against Alexander Reimer, the former Director of the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service, his former Deputy Nicolai Crivolopov, and Victor Odenov, the Director of the Federal Penal Enforcement Service's Information and Communication Centre.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged by the SCRG in Moscow under article 285, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code (abuse of authority with grave consequences), article 159, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (fraud committed by using their official position, in an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Kryvolopov is charged under article 222, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, the individuals in question fraudulently stole from the State Treasury the budget allocated by the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for the persons under control, so-called electronic bracelets.
For theft of budget money, the team developed a scheme under which the PITOC FGCO, under its control, which had entered into the relevant public contracts, produced technical controls and supervision, including “electronic bracelets”, and implemented it at prices overstated several times.
Despite the fact that the CITOC ' s FGCO did not have any production equipment, buildings, or facilities to accommodate the production of the final cycle of the production of “electronic bracelets”, five State contracts valued at more than 3.3 billion roubles have been concluded between it and the Russian Federation ' s FSIN.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles were found in the accounts of the Samar branch of the FGL, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million roubles of cash in cash were received in person by Mr. Raimer in his office from an accomplice for whom a criminal case had been assigned to a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Crivolopov, who had been involved in the fraud, had been found to have an unknown origin of the bullets to the decorated pistol, thus making it possible to charge him with an additional charge.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN has filed a claim for damages in the amount of 2.7 billion roubles against the accused.
Hakan Shukur's football player is suspected of being involved in the putsch.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then a member of Parliament, Hakan Shukur, and searched two of his family's homes.
The star of Turkish football in the 1990s, the early 2000s attacker Hakan Shukur, is wanted by the national authorities in connection with the coup d'état that took place last month.
Forward, who completed his sports career in 2008, is charged with being a member of a “armed terrorist group”.
This is the “Hizmet” movement, a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious figure and opponent, Fathullah Gülen.
It is his President, Erdoğan, who sees him as the organizer of the military coup attempt that took place on 15 July.
Fathullah Guelen is a resident of the United States, and the Turkish authorities request his extradition.
According to the local media, a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukur was issued today, and the police have already searched two houses belonging to the former footballer's family.
According to the investigation, his father also joined the Fathullah Gülen organization, in addition to Hakan Shukur.
However, neither the former footballer nor his loved ones were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a footballer, Hakan Shukur defended the colors of a number of Turkish clubs and promoted the country's team.
He spent most of his career in Galatasar.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".
True, he didn't spend more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukur is still the most effective attacker of the Turkish team: 112 games for the national team and 51 hits.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his position as a member of the Parliament, due to an ongoing corruption investigation around the Erdoğan party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurryet, at least 42 journalists had been arrested in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of contributing to the coup d'état and of having links with the opposition Islamic preacher Fathullah Guelen, who lives in the United States.
In view of the seriousness of the charges, media officers can wait for long prison sentences, ranging from 10 years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovski wants to create a network of cinemas for domestic films only.
"I'd have set up a network of cinemas exclusively for the Russian movie, for which tickets cost 2-3 times less than for foreign films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovski notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for a viewer with major Hollywood tapes.
We have over 100 paintings in the country a year, with an average of 20 to 25 tapes coming to the screens.
"And even they find it very hard to compete with Transformers and Iron Man, "in which huge budgets are pumped," said the filmmaker.
Recall, on 1 July, the All-Russia Youth Education Forum “Tavrida” began work in Crimea.
Participants include artists and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and a number of countries of the near and far-off.
The British conquered the Olympic gold in the academic row in twos.
The British Helen Glover and Heather Stanning won the Olympic gold in the academic row in twos.
Silver was taken by the New Zealand women Rebecca Scoon and Genevieve Beren, and the third place was taken by Anna Anderson and Hedwig Rasmussen from Denmark.
OO-News - The new contractor promises to deliver Zenith Arena by December 26th.
The new designer of the St. Petersburg stadium, which is to host the Cup of Confederations 2017 and the 2018 World Cup, is the one that Metrostre is to deliver the arena by December 26, reports to RIA Newsty, with reference to the head of the Federation's interim commission to prepare for the World Cup 2018, Vadim Tulpanov.
"Today, we went to the construction site with the Minister of Sport of Russia, Vitaly Mutko, and with us was the CEO of Metrostria, Vadim Alexanderov.
He said he'd rent out the stadium by December 26th.
It's a serious peterburg company, it never breaks the deadline.
Vitaly Mutko and I have been content with what we have seen and heard," quotes the interviewee's agency.
Vitaly Mutko had earlier arrived in St. Petersburg to inspect the site of the upcoming major competition.
Mr. Tulpov also noted that the Sovfed Commission, which he chaired, would continue to monitor the progress of the construction of the stadium and would visit the construction site on a regular basis.
It is recalled that yesterday it was reported that Metrostrost will complete the construction of Zenit Arena, the contract will cost about 5.4 billion roubles. The same company won the tender to upgrade the area around the stadium, the contract value is 2.4 billion roubles. The contracts with the Transstre Corporation, Transstre Corporation Engineering Corporation and Transstre AO have been terminated.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.
For more information on the selection of the new contractor, see the material "OH" "Metrostre" on the field.
In Miassa (Chelebrin oblast), the lawyer of former vice-governor Nikolai Sandakova, Constantin Aculic, was detained.
According to OS-South Ural, another counsel for the accused, Sergei Kolosovsky, Constantine Aculica, was summoned to the SKR Investigation Department of Miyassa today to charge a case of beatings a year ago.
Constantine Aculic then went to the scene as a lawyer to help one of his participants.
"It was originally aroused against unsolved persons, and as he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out to be the Aculic," Sergey Kolosovski.
Constantin Aculic became the ex-president's lawyer in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the summons of counsel to the Miyassa SKR, the defence party was informed that the deadline for reading the fraud case in which Nikolai Sandakov was charged was due on Monday.
We recall that there are two criminal cases against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first (fraud case), he is charged with the promise of 1.5 million roubles to promote the appointment of the head of the administration of Lake Yevgeny Tarasov as the mayor of Magnitogorsk.
The second criminal case concerned the bribe that Nikolai Sandakov had allegedly received from the Director of the POP “Piton” Igor Kalugin in the form of the illegal donation of at least 1.3 million roubles of property services.
For more information on the case of Mr. Sandakov, read "OJ" in "The former vice-governor demands merging his business."
The Russian Copper Company (RMI) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMI has undertaken to upgrade one of the country's oldest and most ecologically polluted companies, the Karabash Copper.
The Carabasian Med smelting plant was founded by the British Stock Company, led by Leslie Urquartt in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided a whole city with life.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was halted, causing serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998 a decision was taken to resume the operation of the Karabash Medal Combination.
One of the main problems of the Karabash plant was also to be addressed: the environment.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh had already been infamously known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation in Karabasmedi began to change in 2004, after the company was under the control of the Russian Copper Company.
The company had begun to upgrade production, which had gradually reduced the environmental burden.
This was also noted recently by the Governor of Chelyabin oblast, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in the early days of July.
The head of the South Ural called the huge changes that had taken place with the business since the Karabasmedy moved to the RMI group.
The main effort to upgrade Karabasmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new serno-acid factory that captures up to 99.9 per cent of the metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Copper Company, the total investment in the project was about 7 billion roubles.
The next stage of the upgrade of the Karabashmedia is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of three converters, sprayers, gas tracts is scheduled for late 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, it is planned to launch a new 1 billion- roubles industrial waste-cleaning facility at the end of 2016.
In turn, the sums of taxes to be paid to the budget of the city of Karabakh will also increase.
Over the course of the Tomin project, from the start of the construction to the start of the second phase, the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
And once the GCO is put into operation, the tax to all levels can be 80.9 billion roubles.
Over the year of production in the Varnen region, 346.3 million roubles have been allocated to the various levels of the budget.
And that's in the first year.
"The longer the business works, the more the contribution can be, "Valary Ulanowski added.
In the RMI, it was specified that in 2015 the tax outlays from the Miheev PCO had approached 1 billion roubles.
However, the participation of RMI enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax contributions.
The RMI enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, the construction of cultural and entertainment facilities, and the development of areas.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabagh was to renovate and, in fact, to restructure the N9 kindergarten by 95 students.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency state.
In addition, a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and extraterrestrial parking spaces for 600 machines, cafés and sports shops will be located on the RMI Arena.
RMI Arena will allow for international sporting events to be held in a spectacle.
But the main objective of this project is to make fitness and sport in a comfortable environment accessible to the people of Chelyabinsk, especially the children.

The pensioner turned the ladder into a budget beach tower.
Network users laughed at the images of an older man installing a ladder on the beach and transforming it into a jump-in-water spring.
The picture was published on a number of entertainment portals, as well as on a group called "My Taganrog" on the social network Vkontakte, which led many to believe that the picture was taken on the shore of the Sea of Azov.
In the comments, "innovation" was referred to as the "budget tower" and the "mobile tramlin".
Many lauded a man for ingenuity and "smart," and some noted that a man was at a serious risk of getting hurt by jumping off his tower because he had set it at a low depth.
However, one of the commentators on the Pikabu portal noted that it was not possible to judge the depth of the sea by the image.
"First, we don't know what depth it is, the beach can be sprinkled with a sharp drop by a meter right behind the ladder, and secondly, even if it's a metre of depth, with the proper ability to jump from a couple of meters," wrote the user under the name C0JIBAMDJZ

Migulu was found guilty of the offences set out in articles 286 (Excess of power), 285.1 (non-earmarked expenditure of budget) and 285 (abuse of authority) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation found that in December 2008, the official had provided a plot of land to a friend in the village of Muhinka, in violation of the procedure established by the land law.
In 2006, it illegally ordered the acquisition of a road bridge over the Chigiri River, at an overpriced price, without competitive procedures and a municipal contract, and Interfax specifies.
In addition, from 2007 to 2010, Migula, in the interest of a commercial organization under its control, changed the time frame for the payment of the contract for the sale of the lease of the land that had been provided for the construction of the dwelling, as well as exempting the company from rent.

The holders of messaging and postal services must identify the users and remove the prohibited information - this is the brief content of the bill developed by the Media and Communication Union (MUS), which brings together the major Russian telecommunications operators (with the “Messages”).
The staff of the three member companies confirmed that the project was under discussion.
In early autumn, it is to be presented to a working group led by the First Vice-Prime Minister, Igor Sholov, who is speaking to the "Memorials" in the ISS.

WSJ: The US is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation because of the hacking of Democrat servers.
US officials are considering the imposition of new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, writing The Wall Street Journal with links to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, US President Barack Obama’s administration is said to have to formally charge Russia’s servers or Russian-backed hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other United States intelligence services are almost certain of Russia's involvement in cyberattacks.
WSJ notes that the US usually prefers not to name the hackers.
The exception is the 2014 hacking of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was officially responsible.
But last year Obama issued a decree to simplify the imposition of sanctions on those who implement or promote cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but it can be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions can be long, writing.
Even if officials had concluded that the hackers had acted with Russia’s support, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before making a decision on the disclosure.
It is up to them to determine whether the incident is so serious as to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that the Obama administration was allowing sanctions to be imposed on a State whose hackers had hacked into the Democratic Party National Committee's servers.
WikiLeaks published an e-mail to the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities might be involved in the hacking.
In the Kremlin, such reports were described as absurd.
FAS fined Google for almost half a billion roubles
The reason was the disruption of the market for mobile applications.
The antimonopoly proceedings were initiated by the Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google gave smartphone manufacturers access to Android components under conditions that prohibited pre-installing applications from other developers, particularly the Yandex.
The FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company had abused the dominant position of the market and had forced the manufacturers of mobile devices to install other applications along with Google Play.
As a result of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, reporting to the FAS head Alexei Dozenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the competition law should be enforced by all companies, including transnational corporations.
Google, in turn, intends to study the solution first, and only then will it be determined to follow up on it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service found the company to be in breach of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered the contract to be amended by 18 December.
However, Google did not accept it.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting judicial proceedings.
The FAS noted that despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of a settlement agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This was the opinion of the lead analyst of Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would have no effect on the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.
The Volgan leased the apartment and then stole it for 84,000 roubles.

The total amount of the damage was 84,000 roubles.
Shortly afterward, the guards of the order came to the mark of the thief.
They turned out to be a 30-year-old unemployed wizard.

He will now have to be held accountable for the theft in the strictness of the law - criminal proceedings have been brought against the detainee.

Allowances for the payment of property taxes, particularly for pensioners, will be granted to the privileged categories of citizens.
Also, under the land tax, there is a system of deductions based on the tax payer's preferential category, but according to the head of the FSN, it is too early to say so before 2017.

The Anime effect of Snapchat is criticized as a cartoon for Asians.
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators say it is racially tactless.
Using the "Linza" tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and to play with individuality in ways that are bound by absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to frame a picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
The lenses are ruthless, twisting features of tools that produce more than 30 million adjusted selfies a day.
Any error is quickly known to the public.
The Snapchat lenses had been criticized in the past when they had been accused of advertising the dark skin of the face or promoting white faces as the ideal of beauty.
So, when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them curvature eyes, crooked teeth, and bleak cheeks, some critics thought it was a racist cartoon for Asians, the yellow-faced.
And they wondered if these repeated contradictions point to the company's more serious problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, news and further resentment went out on The Verge and Motorboard, the day after Snapchat claimed to have removed this function.
The company commented that the lens was designed as a respect for the characters of the anime, not as a cartoon for the Asians.
But for experts who know about racism in the first place, the lens reminiscent of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others have completely rejected the analogy of anime.
In an e-mail to Grace Sparpani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of the photos was actively shared, said that the lens was "intimidating and at least embarrassing."
She added that "it's hard to argue with a comparison of a very rude cartoon on the Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced, but highly degraded yellow-faced.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, from the corporate halls to Hollywood and the devies that we all carry.
And a huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean that they're more likely to expect to understand.
When one of the Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Cathy Joo, "it's much harder to stay unnoticed than it used to be."
On Thursday, Joo, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to remove her account from Snapchat and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believed that racial discord was the reason for the lack of diversity in the recruitment of staff in Snipchat.
==History==Zhu was critical of the white management of the company, composed of only men, and finished her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnaphat.
As Zhu, who is herself an American Chinese-born, wrote, "They didn't have enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people, but they don't hold positions that can be spoken in a safe and open manner."
Other observers share her view, dissatisfactioning that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but according to the trustee, the company had recently hired a recruit to focus on under-represented segments of the population and on active attempts to attract domestic resources.
For her part, Zhu said that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say it's not going to work."
The military has distorted ISIL intelligence, reports to the Congressional Commission
The U.S. Central Command of the Armed Forces changed their intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it might justify on the ground, reported to the Congressional Commission in a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the task force established by the Republican Presidents of the House of Representatives Committee on FAA, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations found “broadly common discontent” among the analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service, who claimed that the leaders had misdirected them to assess American actions to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military agency in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents approved by the Centcom High Command generally gave a more optimistic picture of U.S. anti-terrorist action, as confirmed by the actual data from the scene, and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence services,” said the news report.
“What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the top management is misunderstood, our military suffers,” said a member of the House of Representatives, Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The management problems in Centcom are at the top of the organization.
The ten-page report deals in detail with the inadequacies that have developed in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi Armed Forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain final evidence that Obama’s management ordered the falsification of the reports, it argues that the analysts felt that the Centcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than real events,” the report reported.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul might begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second-largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is certain," said House of Representatives member Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top management of the U.S. Central Command Intelligence Service forged command intelligence documents to lower the threat from ISIL in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a task force when they learned that the analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional, unfinished investigation of CENTCOM's intelligence is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party on the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
“During the 2014 and 2015 period, the Centre set up an overly closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments concerning ISIL and the Iraqi security forces,” claims House of Representatives member Adam B. Shiff, the main representative of the Democratic Party on the committee.
This procedure, according to Šiff, “delayed the issuance of intelligence documents”, damaged the morale of analysts and “not sufficiently reflected diverging views”.
But Shiff and the Democrats claim that they found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom Analysts to fit their findings into a “triggered or political interpretation”.
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were presented on Tuesday at The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of the Pentagon, which was opened following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress as long as the Chief Inspector's investigation continued.
But he said that “the experts sometimes disagree in the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues of national security”.
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American bombardment in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence is now asserting) has reached its target.
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide accurate assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism over the Islamic State echoes the controversy that took place more than a decade ago, when an intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article alleging that the administration of President George Walker Bush, because of the protest of many analysts, had expressed support for a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought of what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, Hooker's team concluded that, despite public claims to the contrary, the attacks on oil refineries belonging to the Islamic State had not led to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group, because it had built temporary oil refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not spread outside the Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered to be overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was reassigned to the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The US wins four times in a row in a women's field hockey, bringing it closer to a decisive fight with Britain.
Once a three-gat match that ended up winning Japan with a 6-1 score, Cathy Bam opened the account on Thursday with the first two hits for the U.S. women's hockey team on the grass, when the Americans won the 3-0 team of India.
Five heads in two games are supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says she's not sure if she'd ever do something like that.
"I don't know," she said.
I'm not really the kind of person who's been tracking his goals.
This is what she knows: the 4-0 Americans' score at the Olympics, and they compete for the first place in their band with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan's 2-0 loss on Thursday.
The British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams claim a quarter finale, and the result of the game will determine who will be the first in their group of six teams, and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid meeting a strong team of Dutch rivals, the leaders of another group, in a bit of time when the quarterfinals play.
But the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made a noise in their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time, taking a field hockey club when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played this sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16 and became her youngest player in history.
She skipped the 2008 Olympics when she didn't make the final selection tour.
Then it came to 2012, when things didn't work out between her and her teammates.
The following year, Koyg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical change," Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we have right now.
We've completely changed our mindset.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India went to the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team showed up surprisingly hard and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative in his hands.
She made a long passage with the ball down the left side of the field, then slid in the middle, and rushed the ball to the gate, giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" win was the first in the United States goalkeeper's tournament, Jackie Briggs, to miss one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's in shock.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," Parnham said, "but how good it depends on the result of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the turbulence of the Olympic Games, the "Day" jumps on the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio seem to be constant and inevitable, and this is a rabid combination of competition and ambition.
It's like the Olympic fire itself is that burning torch that's going from the archer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or eavesdropping the conversation of your neighbors in turn at the café, and not hear about Simon Bayles, Cathy Ledeki, or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time, a handsome man with holes on his cheeks, might well be among the celebrities in prime-time promoted by sponsors and life-confirming adverts if he was a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a fencer.
But the 28-year-old Dooley, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic jumps on the trampoline.
The Olympic fire does not cover all events in the same way.
Farther from the center, in part in the shadows, are sports that are not generally accepted: the shooting of a pneumatic pistol, the shooting of onions, the badminton, the Taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long as he reigns.
But if I'm allowed to speak shyly in defence of my personal passion, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on the trampoline.
While jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I have interviewed have not been aware that they are all about the Olympics.
It can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in jumping on the trampoline, and their athletes did not go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians tend to share male awards, while Chinese and Canadians share female awards.
Dun Dun from China and Rosey McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But jumping on a trampoline has an outside charm, particularly because for an uninformed ear, it is more associated with a circus college than with the Olympics.
Here, I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a grounded enthusiast.
They do have a comical potential -- a cartoon glimpse of endless jumps -- but also the elegance of gymnastics and water jumps, the two kinds of sport that they mostly combine.
The word "batut" is derived from the Spanish word "el trompolín", which means "the spring for jumping in the water."
The bidders jump on a giant trampoline, flying about 30 feet in the air, and have to perform a series of acrobattic stunts (turns, bends, and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated by execution, difficulty, and flight time, according to the official programme of the Olympics.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is to go ahead.
The bidders for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, up and down the field.
They want not only the finish line or the start wall, but also, in view of the TV cameras, to the other frightening line: the world record or the Olympic record.
It is a longing for noble, admirable, even fanatical, and it is enough to make even the viewer cry.
But it's, in my opinion, a bit tiring to watch the games.
He's giving you a break from jumping on the trampoline.
The direction of the trampoline is upwards.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps up, looks weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then without the effort to get up again.
And, of course, they are not without competition or difficulty, but throughout the program, there is no crazy zeal for the finish, no long jumps, just a strange, elegant loss of time and gravity.
This is the closest to the Olympic day.
Women's qualifying competitions, and the finals will be held on Friday afternoon, an hour of the day in Eastern European time, and a man's on Saturday, as well as an hour.
The NBC will broadcast the finals as part of the day programme from 2 p.m. to 2 p.m. in both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a quiet, beautiful moment is expected that can easily be seen in a common dump.
And if a rise in consciousness can only be achieved by exposing male athletes to hung-ups and lenses — as the Wall Street Journal said recently suggested to the male hymnist in the United States — Dooley is waiting for his new admired crowd of fans.
"The Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a long-standing US ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia faced a violent opposition from the Government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were fatally injured in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of splitting up?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, extending to an ever-growing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people went to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the Government's reaction was brutal.
Witnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos from the protest sites, allegedly taken at the end of the past or earlier this year, show how security officers beat young men with sticks when they put their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It's always been hard to keep this country from falling apart, and it's gonna be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the head of the African Horn project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa is receiving such support from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably, even with a new suburban train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia had hardly been a model of democracy — human rights organizations had consistently referred to government repression — the opposition in the territory of the State had been suppressed by the fact that the dissidents had in fact been silenced.
Many of them had been exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and left with no options but to protest, the uprising will rise," said Seyoum Teshoma, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints ranged from land use to the takeover of power by a government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies had completely displaced the opposition and now controlled 100 per cent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tension along the border with Eritrea is on the rise; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Front for the Liberation of Oromo or the Front for the National Liberation of Ogaden, may try to resort to unrest and re-arm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, which have been boiling deep for a few years, are now on the rise.
The first seems to be completely harmless: smartphones.
In the last couple of years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace, and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through a proxy server that hides where they are.
A number of young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized themselves for protest.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amhara, from predominantly Christian highlands in Ethiopia, has flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in low-lying areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will work together under a single command," said Mulat Hemem, leader Oromo.
The major protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo districts.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population, and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who might have foreseen the danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly skillful in detecting the first signs of discontent and using spies to extract data and neutralize opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” said Abdi, an analyst in conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Dessalin, appeared out of nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a Souther.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that this will result in more bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia experienced such upheavals in 2005, after thousands of people protested what the analysts said was probably an election that the government shut down and then forged the results.
In the ensuing repression, many Protestants had been killed, albeit in a smaller number than in the last months, and that period of upheaval had gone relatively fast.
Development experts expressed appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for the visionary development of infrastructure, such as the new long-distance train and significant success in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this did not stop the growing internal dissatisfaction of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondara, a city in Amhar, attacked the companies belonging to Tigray, and anti-Tigray hatred on social media is becoming all-encompassing.
Analysts claim that the protesters put the United States and other Western allies in an uncomfortable position.
The American Government had used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already volatile region.
"And it will be hard to get through this stretched wire," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIL was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the last conflict that hit his election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State's terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican party's presidential candidate to speak to the American people in a sensible way.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during a period of upheaval, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
By making this assumption at the convention on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton had founded ISIL.
But in a Twitter post early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just ejecting.
This post was in direct contrast to the statement made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his charge.
When Radio Conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his speech, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIL, the presidential candidate from the Republican Party did not take the opportunity.
The last scandal erupted when Trump tried to redirect his campaign to the economy against the background of lower ratings.
Trump and Clinton gave competing talks on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to get back to the subject.
Again using Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would increase taxes, and he said that he found her speech boring.
Trump used sarcasm as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he had come up with a general criticism, in fact expressing the idea that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, saying, "Of course I'm kidding."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is acceptable in political speech and to take his word back if necessary.
"I think it's his way to test some of the messages that are responding to his fans, to see how they work, and then to "explare" them in one way or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, the communicator who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his remarks, and he knows that they're vague enough to be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of softening comments for the general electorate, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days, while his ratings continue to drop.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump was in a high-end position in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and was at the same level in Florida.
Although Trump tends not to apologise for the provocative things he talks about, he often accuses his critics of misinterpretation of his words and misunderstanding of his sense of humor.
But as Trump has been the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support it, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is one of the most famous deputies of Trump, made a serious effort to protect the candidate in the interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is an acceptable political comment," said Juliani, when he was asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIL was an almost unknown small organization, he called it a non-threatening, totally unjust, and that is why it happened, because it had withdrawn troops from Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans claim that the Obama administration, in which Clinton held the post of Secretary of State, allowed ISIL to develop because it failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for depressing and biasing every word he said.
He mocked the "poor poor" TV experts who were trying to figure it out, and he said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuses as an overstatement that he was not fit for president.
The once-chanched coffee shop is back in Greenpoint.
The Verb's coffee shop was shattered, taking only cash in Williamsburg, which did not have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sheri, which took the place of Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of muffins.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in the new city.
The painter Molly Krabaple tweeted: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is ruined, and Verb is now a soap store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The Verb's renovated coffee shop opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original site.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Plus, the coffee's still good.
At the head of the new Verba is Sisko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there to the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said he'd love to do it.
Rodriguez, aged 36, left a lot of the same.
Verb works with the same bagels distributer and bought the same model of the coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he'd also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu contains bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches, and there are capers or fried onions.
There's a dish of brown rice.
They don't serve any more beer at the coffee shop, but they're making fresh-pressed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said that he had noticed the constant flow of old regulars.
"Many ex-clients have also been squeezed out of Williamsburg," he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, who was 34 years old, used to live in Williamsberg and had frequent visits to Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me in Verbe," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although that day, instead of the regular ice-coffee, she ordered a cup of tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, has been a loyal visitor to Verb since 2003.
He stopped by before work and ordered the same thing all the time.
"At 15 o'clock, every day, like an hour, I came, and my bagel was cooked with butter and all the fillings," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and put new dishes on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still making a routine order, but one day he'll change something with bacon, eggs, or cheese on the bagel with all the stuff.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended by the fact that the soap store had once taken over the old place.
Moreover, the Soup Sherry owners proposed that special soap be made for Verb, using coffee from a cold-made coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer," said Rodriguez.
The permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint, of Polish origin, also loved the coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the window to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
The local point for the sale of juices plans to spill bottles and sell cold-made coffee.
There's a chance that the coffee shop will join the next building.
For many clients, it's enough that the new Verb will put their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client, and he said that he had suffered grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he went in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
"How long I've wanted to smell it," he confessed.
Depressive depressive food in the "Floy Breakfast"
In March 1933, shortly after taking up the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fancy Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras and Merylland Turtle Soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: the fried eggs in tomato sauce, the mashed potatoes, and the dessert pudding of prunes.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to feed."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are food history experts.
Coa's last book, "Rage in Chinese," was devoted to China's kitchen in America, and Siegelman gave a history of life in a flat in the lower East Side via food in her book "The House of 97 on the Fruit Garden Street."
Their new joint work, "The Planet", to be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
In some measure of their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Esenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, simple diner in Flatairtown, which has been operating since 1929, the year of the market failure.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich of olives, and Coy, 57, took the turkey, the mashed potatoes, and the vegetable mix.
When a reporter ordered a meat loaf, the couple considered it to be a good starting point for the discussion of food in the period of depression.
"The roulettes were in high demand," said Siegelman.
There was peanut roll, liver roll, bean roll.
It was made of a basic ingredient and a cheap product that allowed the ingredient to be stretched out.
Imagine you ate as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coy's wrinkled.
"It must have been in the stomach with a rock," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in the countryside, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and the fresh baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult subject for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as complicated was the new budget diet: the mysterious dishes, such as rolls and bakers, became the main foods; the bakery is a "precious way to dispose of the remains," said Siegelman, because the cooks might have hidden the unsuppletic ingredients under a dense layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which has been the basis of American food for many years, has become an economical luxury.
People have tried strange mixes because energy and nutritious values have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
In her studies for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of the same age: baked onions with peanut butter.
"This addition to the lunch table was not a success," Coe said.
Siegelman added, "It was very strange."
Peanut butter does not fit the liver onion at all.
This was common in many home-based recipes.
More than ever since, homemakers — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Economics Bureau, from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “contributors of the budget,” to accept the challenge, and to convert a burde like protetic spaghetti with carrots to tasty dishes.
"Floy tablet" is a banquet of curious historical facts.
The government's reaction to hungry citizens, for example, is particularly puzzling, as President Herbert Hoover's "let's eat pies."
Publicly exalted by a simple farmer's cooking in the state of Iowa during his childhood, he was eating like a sophisticated millionaire who became a millionaire.
"He liked the continental kitchen, like the fish with the cucumber sauce," he said.
He ate almost in a golden dining room, wearing a tux.
It was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book tells us, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was completely uninterested in taste, and this led the White House to "use not only the most depressing food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked food."
Many of the depressive culinary techniques were forgotten as soon as the country was back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Siegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The couple say that at the time of writing the book, they had a better understanding of their mother’s eating habits — that she had not been able to throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being negligent about food," he said.
Siegelman remembers, "She's seriously poisoned people."
There was a bad case with the profilers.
When the dishes at Eissenberg's were empty, he and Coe got the dessert that they made at home: the pruning dessert that President Roosevelt had ate for lunch.
"It's called a mousse of pruning," said Siegelman, adding that it was a common use - to give low-level prescriptions brocade names.
There was no whipped cream, just pruning, a bit of flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to put the spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was good.
Co's asked for more twice.
In the voice of a confident budget maker, he said to his wife, "A little ruble walnuts would be a good thing."
The arrest of members of the Khovan Cemetery Mass Fight case was extended until 14 November
The Presnian court left the case of a mass fight at the Cemetery of Khovan on 14 November under arrest, granting the request of the investigation.
In the case, there are 14 accused.
On 14 May, several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus fought in the Cemetery of Khovan with weapons, killing three people.
The former head of the Cemetery, Yuri Chabouev, and a lawyer, co-founder of the public organization Health Nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, have been charged with organizing the murder.
The second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved in the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Olga Hungerec, during a visit to the region of Britannia.
We have specific parameters as to how much an increase in the pension is needed to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
The economists are now taking the results of the six months, and we will complete this work in the next two to three weeks,” quotes the Interfax Faminer.
Commenting on the six-month scheme proposed by the head of the Centre for Strategic Development, Alexey Kudrin, to raise the retirement age for six months each year, the Vice-Prime Minister reported that the subject was not being addressed in the Kabmin.
At the end of July, it was reported that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension benefits in 2017.
Kamensky and Gregorian entered the finals of the small-calibre gun shoot-out.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamenski and Kirill Grigoryan entered the finals of the small-calibre rifle shoot-outs at the Olympics in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergey Kamenski scored 629 points and ranked first, the new Olympic record.
Kirill Gregorian was second, 628.9 was.
A total of eight of the best athletes went to the finals.
Kamenski is the world record in this discipline (633).
The Turkish opponent Fathullah Guillen demands an international investigation into the incident of the attempted coup d'état in Turkey.
“I demand an independent international commission to investigate an attempted coup d'état,” cites the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opponent also said that "if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Guillen denied any involvement in the country, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Court of Istanbul had previously arrested in absentia the opposition Islamic preacher Fathullah Guelen.
Recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilead will reimburse the cost of legal services in a dispute for a patent against Hepatitis C with Merck
Gilead Science Inc. has the right to receive the legal fees it has incurred in connection with a patent claim for a drug against Hepatitis C with a drug producer, Merck & Co Inc., ordered by a federal district judge.
In June, Gilead was released from paying $200 million in damages for the violation of two of Merck's patents related to Gilead's drugs, sales leaders, Sovaldi, and Harvoni, after an American judge discovered a number of violations by Merck, including affidavits and other unethical acts.
On his application to the court on Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to pay the costs incurred in the contest of the claim.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which is dominant in the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can treat over 90 percent of the patients with liver disease.
The case occurred in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the lab work that was the basis of the sophosbuyer, the active ingredient of Gilead's drugs.
US-backed armed forces claim to have intercepted complete control of Manridge from the Islamic State
The United States-backed armed forces took full control of the northern city of Manbridge near the Turkish border, after the last remaining militants of the Islamic State left the city on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now purging the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who have been hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were held by militants and told Reuters by Sharfan Darwish of the Allied U.S.S.C. Military Council of Manbridge.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we're doing clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the Democratic Party presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in philanthropic contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in performance fees, and the former Secretary of State announced an income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the Department of State.
Potential Vice-President Clinton, US Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, issued tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency," said the campaign manager Clinton Jennifer Palmieri.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and is violating his past promises to make his tax returns public.
It's common for US presidents to publish their tax returns, though the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers named the State Tax Service's audit as a reason for his refusal to disclose his tax returns.
"Your move," tweeted Clinton Jan Sams's campaign manager, referring to the Democratic Party candidate's declaration.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the end of the tests.
Critics Trump, including a presidential candidate from the Republican Party in 2012, Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said that his refusal raised questions about his state, his charitable contributions, his business operations, and other links, including with Russia.
Clinton took hold of the question and released an online video on Friday, which focused on prominent Republicans who had convinced Trump to make the tax records public.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in a talk about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done for decades, without exception, to make public their tax returns," she said to the assembly.
Politico reported that Trump had paid no or no tax for two years in the 1990s, and a business columnist in the New York Times quoted many tax attorneys and accountants on Friday who thought that things might still be the case.
The federal tax rate was the subject of a debate in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire, an investor named Warren Buffett, that would guarantee that people who receive more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, he invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he's also under IRS control, and that Trump is "afraid" not of tax agencies, but of voters.
Clinton's pre-electoral headquarters issued tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was a source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index buyout fund, and the Clintons announced a dividend and a capital return of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Tanzanian environmentalists use a non-conventional way to prevent elephants from slipping into localities by throwing chili-filled condoms in them.
The method proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had come up with this idea a few years ago, along with the United States Nature Conservation Committee, took over its promotion by training volunteers in the villages of North Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without harming the animals.
Previously, a lot of people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Since we've invented a set of tools ... we've seen a change in attitudes within these communities, so they're much more confident that they'll be able to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," said the executive director of Honeyguide, Damien Bell.
The first two steps are to light the torch in front of an elephant that breaks the border and to signal the horn.
If it failed to frighten it, the so-called chili cloud is thrown away.
Chili powder, mixed with soil, is put in a condom with a clap, and the end is twisted, and there is only a wick outside.
When a condom is ignited, it breaks up with a roar, spraying small dust of chili powder in the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The ultimate measure is the trigger that fires the Roman candles into the air, making a loud, bright blast.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who left the country after an attempted coup d ' état last July.
This information was given by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mevlut Chavushoglu, in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we withdrew 208 human resources diplomats to continue working at the centre.
Of those, 32 had not returned without objective reasons and explanations,” said the head of the Turkish foreign policy office.
Let us recall that a coup d'état was attempted in Turkey in July.
The national authorities have officially declared that the State party has failed, as well as reported the arrest of over 6,000 people, including senior and mid-level military personnel.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, 290 people died as a result of the coup d'état.
The Jewish director critically criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's "request" phone code to the Arabs, as RT News reported.
The French director of Jewish origin had a media scandal, finding that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli telephone code on the list, and the employees referred to “requests” from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, the author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoa", expressed his dissatisfaction at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lentzman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the hotel's call code list.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the States to which you can call directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel was expelled and eradicated?
It's been written by Lentzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the matter at the hotel office.
The answer he got there, according to Lanzman, was "shocked him."
The hotel clerk said that this measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotel Network."
The reason behind this move caused the director's even more anger.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's code be deleted," said Lanzman, a hotel servant.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handellsman, described the case as “a terrible shame,” reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
That it happened in Germany, and in this hotel network, is even more embarrassing.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,' said the official.
The incident caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel was simply "going on" with the alleged demands of Arab clients.
"We'd be ashamed," said another post, where it was said that the hotel, located on the glorious Corforstendamm Street, was next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself rushed to drop any charges, calling the incident a "uninspection" and "apologizing" to Lentzman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the rapid recruitment list," quotes the representative of the Kempinski Hotel in the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code is now added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students ran into the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when the police tried to disperse the students, which resulted in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in a demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
As proposed by the State Governor of São Paulo, Géraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public high schools will be closed, and 300,000 students will be redirected to save money.
Some protesters were seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim president, Michael Temer.
This last protest took place just a few days after the protesters went to the streets to support the disenfranchised President Dilma Rusef, when the national Senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, reports the RT Business Portal
With the lifting of the sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest on the part of Russian firms in business in the country, said the ambassador.
Russian companies are reconnecting with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagarian said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground transport and weapons,” the Ambassador said.
Jagarian also forecasts a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly to tourists, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran had entered the top 20 countries by the number of visitors to Russia.
It is safe to say that last year's record for the number of Iranian visitors to Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, a relatively small number of Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where monuments of the ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The State continues to roll up the wars in the defence and industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the CEO of Almas - Antey, “missing in work” and “loss of trust”.
Gennady Bender was appointed head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about Nescorodov's dismissal only appeared on Thursday night and did not produce a wide media resonance.
What is the reason for this silence in the context of the large-scale rearming of the army?
It is likely that the management of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumours or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This proves once again that the Defence and Industrial Complex (PPC) has many problems and the State is reluctant to attract increased public attention to them.
The removal of Necorodov is, of course, an important development in terms of order in the industry.
The NGO “Almaz” is the main company of a company that specializes in the production of marine and ground-based air defence systems.
Almaz is currently in the process of setting up the Polyment-Redut and Morpheus, which are to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia Portal, Dmitry Cornev, believes that the dismissal of Nescorodov is due to the disruption of the time frame for the projects.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of the Morpheus started in 2007 and was expected to start in 2013.
Poliment Redut is to be the main air defence system on the most recent Navy ships.
According to the information I'm getting, in a few years of testing, none of the real success tests have been carried out.
True, as far as I can tell, it's not the absolute fault of "Almaza," said Cornev.
The expert is concerned that a delay in entry into service may also occur with the “C-500” RCA.
The pilot design of the project has not yet been completed, but the first complexes are expected to enter the force during 2016.
In the Department of Defence, it is stated that “the work is scheduled and will be completed within the established time frame”, although in 2014 the agency recognized the problem of the development of the P-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Nescorodov, who has been the manager of Almasm since 2011.
The Cornev found that project delays could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in the PKK and business management plans.
The industry received long-term orders for tens of billions of roubles, and a lot of money is known to love silence.
Directors of defence companies tend to resign at will, under the agreement of the parties, or to be reassigned to other jobs.
In the present case, the suspension took place in public, although it was not resonant.
This suggests that the head of "Almaza" might have been a figure of stoutness and resisted the "disarmament" coming down on top.
It appears that the State no longer intends to tolerate such conduct.
By the hands of the shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence and fail to carry out their tasks.
At the same time, the management of the Russian Federation is trying to punish the swamped managers (the "Star" shipyards).
The President himself has given increased attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin is the head of the Military Industrialization Commission and holds periodic re-arming meetings.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the PKK managers in an effort to have a loyal number of directors who will follow orders from the top.
This is far from an ideal policy, but in the face of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the PKK, the State has no other instruments.
The current state of defence is not, of course, catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces to order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of managers in the PKK, the management of the Russian Federation is taking very successful steps to improve the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The army has acquired a new quality with the assumption of the post of Minister of Defence, Sergey Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted a well-known proverb, "If you want peace, get ready for war."
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the drawbacks of the bipolar system, it worked well.
The lack of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East prove this.
The celebration of the “winners” in the Cold War eventually led to the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States, there is probably no quiet place left in the "civilized world."
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
Under such circumstances, the Navy and the army remain the only allies of our country.
The strengthening of military power will make it possible for Moscow to better defend national interests and to enter new frontiers of world policy.
The Scotsman Callum Skinner races the finish line, so the British take the bike gold.
The Scotsman Callum Skinner raced to the triumph of the men's team sprint at the wheelhouse in Rio last night, which led the British Command Trio to defend its title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old son of Glasgow was the strongest, which his Scots buddy, Sir Chris Hoy, made his own, and the young man proudly entered history, rushing down the finish line to take the victory out of the foreman team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy declared the right to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they replayed the stunt after finishing with modestly the sixth in the March World Cup at the London track race, despite the fact that Hoy had since finished his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Stuff's specialist.
They did it just when Hindes showed up.
Joy's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was followed by British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scots, which was now realized.
Hindes, Kennie, the champions with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set the Olympic record, but the norm was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British Trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed up.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes was on his way to a bigger show to slow down and let Kenny and, in particular, Skinner keep up the pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as an invited BBC expert and caught Skinner, Kennie, and Hindez's look when they entered the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the finals and won the world's champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes deliberately fell on the track after a failed start.
He later gave up the comment, and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the podium."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost so many world-name races that win the Olympics again was amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If this is the barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the cyclist is waiting for five more successful days.
With the form shown by Kenny, it's not beyond the opportunity to imagine how he's replaying Hoy's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in the same games.
This would make it possible to see Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 - a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Moe Farah, and Roger Bannister - bring his account to six gold medals and one silver medal.
It'd be just like Hoy's.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint, which begins today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Teamwork is always the best.
You're coming to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he's got to get knighthood."
It was the only medal day, but there was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull are qualified by the fastest four-mile team race.
They finished at 3:51,943.
The world record set for the gold win in London 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the finals (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will be the focus.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualification race, when officials demanded that he measure his weight.
At the relevant women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsel Shend, Elinor Barker, and Katy Archibald of Milgawi have improved the world record by showing the time of 4:13,260.
The British Command has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take over the middle of the Olympics and make a lot of medals.
In fact, after an exceptional demonstration of complete supremacy in Beijing and London, expectations have been eroded in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas in the second place, not the last one, the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April, because of charges of sexism and harassment, and the departure of major figures, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the basis of the race of the first night on the cyclist, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain in reaching the top at the right time may well be recurring.
The future of the Portland metallurgy plant is at risk due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminium factory in Victoria, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is threatened by the fact that the electric power company that supplies the plant, according to one of the factory's owners, is about to terminate the contract of delivery: it is planned that all delivery contracts will be terminated.
This is a result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
A fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at the Alcoa factory in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs, both direct and indirect, can be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of the total electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down the steel factory at Point Henry, which led to the shutdown of the Englesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland Steel Plant is losing money and risking closure.
This action was the result of a reflection on the future of the plant, which has been going on for a number of years, initially because of the strengths of the Australian dollar, and later because of the price of the factory's products.
AGL, which provides electricity to a large aluminium plant from its Loy Young A power plant in Latrob Wally, said that it expected the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the joint short-term company Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have a smaller share.
"The AGL team expects the Portland site to continue to work, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, the contracts in question are so-called “hedged contracts”, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of termination, so they will in fact end in 2017.
“The AGL, therefore, still expects that these contracts will produce their share of the revenue in FY17,” the electricity company stated.
Any potential impact on AGL's profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited by forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in terms of the “future avoidance”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect Alcoa's ability to manage the metallurgical plant or to supply electricity to the metallurgical plant”.
An American company stated that in 2010 it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Young, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but that it still had to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgy plant in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle because of the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier this week, AGL's Chief of Operations, Stephen Mikkelsen, said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, while Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both plants exit the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as a producer, it will be bad,' he said.
Not just the star of the Kardashian reality show, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, the model and the fourth daughter of the Cardashian-Jenner family of Chris's mother manager, appeared on the prestigious September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the brand of Estee Lauder and defiled for fashion weeks in Milan, Paris, and New York, gave this news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
"While I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at the cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the Cardashian Family?), a reality video, in which the whole Cardashian-Jenner family (the Rob and Caitlyn debacles, who also joined the world's favorite show-business uncle, the producer of the Cardashian family, Ryan Seacrest), forgot to see the sister on the cover and, at the end, the classical turn: they were planning a surprise party.
It's a standard plot line for almost all episodes of a children's TV show dedicated to a birthday (Sicrus says, "Did you think we'd forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the show at 8:00 a.m.), but Chris needed to get that fame to the other girls in one way or another.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have no doubt entered the new era of the Kardashian show.
May Senior Nurse Kendall Kim have been on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on her with her husband, Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September edition is the best-selling edition of Vogue in the year.
The volume, which is more like a gifted edition than a fancy magazine, attracts a huge number of ads. (Fashionista Portal, 615 pages of last year's 832-page edition, has contained ads.)
The news of which of the stars will be on the cover of the magazine is so eager to see that in the last two years the images of the magazine have been combined to the official ad.
Among the previous women on the cover were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "model-worked celebrities" on the cover than "models that are celebrities."
The winner of the Oscar Award and the face of the brand Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honour.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as an “extradition model” of his generation, falls in the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not related to prominent people, to reality show stars, or to modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner is in all of these categories).
These are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, which appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in his career in connection with the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, in view of her past TV reality show star, should always have been shaky.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "fucks of the moment."
These moods were again stirred up after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it doesn't make sense to focus on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September Vogue.
It is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.

Public legal centres refuse to service 160,000 people per year
Each year, more than 160,000 least protected people are denied services in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an impact that will further reduce funding to the already overexploited activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly the elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, those who are unable to deal with unfair deprivation of property, etc. — have already been denied access to free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services, which are already operating outside the limits of their capabilities, are preparing for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of Queensland Public Law Centers, James Farrell, said that, according to the most recent census of the National Association of Public Law Centers, thousands of people had been denied a year.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government's decision was not overturned, the situation would only worsen.
"The Queensland Public Legal Centers are constantly underfunded: that means that thousands of people are denied vital services," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with uncontrollable and bankrupt debts, families who are divorced, unfairly dismissed workers - all of them have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected Queensland residents will have to deal with complex legal issues without help.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately cancel these cutbacks so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the funding of free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Palascuk Government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's pre-electoral headquarters was sued after the staff member was allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York City, Donald Trump's election headquarters was sued: the headquarters allegedly did nothing after the report that his operations director in North Carolina had threatened a staff member with a pistol while they were on their way to the jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court action filed on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's pre-electoral headquarters.
Bordini said he'd been waiting for months for the problem to be solved internally, but he realized "it's not gonna happen."
Director Earl Phillip "screw a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and directed the blow to Vincent's kneecap," so Bordini claims in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional office of the pre-electoral headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people had taken part in similar incidents with Phillip, and was confirmed in the appeal.
"Pistols don't have to shoot to cause harm," said Bordini in a complaint.
The suit took place just two days after the Republican party presidential candidate made a fuore, telling North Carolina listeners that the “second amendment men” — understood as possessors of weapons and their lovers — could start to act if his rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected and was able to choose the judges.
Trump's pre-electoral headquarters said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not expressed support for the violence.
In his complaint, Bordini claims compensation from the electoral headquarters for sloppy control, and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, assault and moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks is slow to respond to the request for comment.
Trying to talk to Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the pre-electoral headquarters.
In response to a call from his consulting firm, the Innovation Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
A Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, ran a controversial campaign.

Britain must put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring renaissance and prosperity not only in our localities and in general throughout London, but also throughout the country.
To me, that was exactly the huge advantage of Heathrow, just like it was in London 2012, where we made every effort to make sure that our peoples and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we'll do it again, creating opportunities for locals and firms near Heathrow.
Only for our localities here will we create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As was the case with London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we would find ourselves in a difficult world.
Sceptics were wrong in 2012 and will be shown to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about it.
Like the Heathrow Olympics, it is an infrastructural project for most, not just for a narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which introduced the 11 billion pounds of infrastructural investment programme on time and within the budget, from T5, the best-elected airport terminal for five consecutive years, to T2, built in the middle of the world's two most active airstrips.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, backed up by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics have been a huge success for the United Kingdom, and I am sure that Heathrow's expansion will be as well.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit on the right track and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton - Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Commercial Attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing cat-and-mouse on the blocking of ads
For companies that make money on the Internet ads, trying to bypass the software to block ads is a game of cat-and-mouse, according to one of the companies that is creating the software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block ads on its desktop version, Adblock Plus posted a blog that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social media again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that a desktop version of the website would change the top of its ads to make it more difficult for blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adlock now claims to have been able to bypass the new code.
In his blog, Adlock Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of interplay between the open source advertising community and those who try to bypass it has continued since the invention of the blocking of the ad,” and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world's largest social network has been engaged in a struggle is a clear sign of the extent to which the industry's advertising blockers have become a major problem.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to the last year's Pagefair and Adobe study, almost four times the number of people who used such software in 2013.
Taking into account 1.3 billion daily active users who log on to Facebook via mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84 percent of Facebook's revenue from ads.
However, the company's hunts for desktop ads, as mobile ads are not effective in Facebook mobile applications for social media and Instagram, according to the representative.
Still, the ad in the desktop version is a lucrative article enough to make Facebook think that such a step is a lucrative investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was about to update its “advertise” tool to give people more control over the way the ads hit them.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adlock filters are a cause for concern, as they will also block some unreleasing content on the site.
"This will not be a good experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertisers are a ruthless tool, so instead we've focused on creating tools like advert preferences to hand over control to people.
A woman was moved on a Swiss motorway in an episode of apparent suicide.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a number of vehicles on the motorway have been moved by a woman in the early hours of Thursday morning, in a clear attempt to commit suicide.
The incident took place at A1 near the Morge in Canton Vaud, just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a sign of desperation" and was hit by a number of vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
Clearly, the victim, a Swiss woman at the age of 49, was hit by a number of vehicles, including a truck.
She died right there.
A number of involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police have been told that they and others who have witnessed the incident are being called upon to respond.
A criminal case was brought, a “logical” step in the situation, and counsel, Gille Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve, stated.
However, it is still to be determined whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a strike?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine," Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case, both of which involve a man walking in the dark on the freeway, it was said that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on A1 near Pyern in the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, heard the trial.
The court found that a female policeman, who responded to an emergency call, was driving a vehicle that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was a “exclusive and unforeseeable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone in possession of information about the incident on Thursday at the Walrus must call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been inhabited, as estimated by the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the Nasova Institute for Space Research, Goddard, have developed a model for the study of the past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether there might have been conditions like the Earth in Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and an atmosphere over-saturated with carbon dioxide.
Scientists had previously assumed that the low rate of rotation of Venus was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the last simulation suggests that Venus might have had a dilute atmosphere like the Earth, and still be moving slowly.
The model also reviewed the topography of the early Venus.
There were probably more drylands on the planet than on the Earth, but once it had enough water and enough geographic variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent of the party.
"According to the GISS model, the slow turn of Venus sets up its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months at a time," explained a GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio.
This warms the planet's surface and produces a rain that produces a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella that protects the planet's surface from a significant part of the solar heat.
The result is an average climate temperature, which is surprisingly somewhat colder than it is today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, which is similar to that of earlier planetary scientists.
Despite the fact that Venus may have been inhabited for a few billion years, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen ran out, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- that is, Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model in Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving the position of coach of the Avalanche team.
Patrick Roy left the position of coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey business on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
The executive vice president/head manager of the Colorado team, Joe Sakick, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as Chief Trainer and Vice-President of the Colorado Avalanche Hockey, with energy, passion, and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I spent a long and hard time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needed and to raise it to a higher level.
To that end, the vision of the coach and the vice president of hockey must be perfect in line with the vision of the organization.
He must also have the right to vote in making decisions that affect the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost the playoffs for the past two years.
The Avalanche team announced an evaluation of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season, and was five points behind the Wild team in the race for the second concession road to the Western Conference.
The gateman from the Hall of Fame, Roy, won four Stanley Cups, two each with the Montreal Canadas and the Avalanche.
North Sea oilmen resume talks and stop the strike
Working strikes on oil workers' salaries in the North Sea have been suspended, and all the parties to the debate are embarking on a new round of talks, with the lead representatives of the parties reporting.
The strike against the Wood Group oil service was sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and United and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve the current disputes,” says the joint statement.
We will hold a number of full-time meetings over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of next week, to look at the problems with fresh eyes.
The trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in over 25 years, was directed against the potential reduction of wages up to 30 per cent.
This year, Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to negative market tensions.
The company ' s rate fell after a 10 per cent reduction in the rate for contract employees working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts would give it the space needed to break the market down.
Shell, for its part, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to cut off oil and gas activities in the countries to 10, as it rationalized its activities as a result of its mega merger with the British power company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower prices for unpurified oil: the economic situation has deteriorated because of the decision to withdraw from the European Union in June by the United Kingdom.
A Scottish member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts that have arisen in the North Sea in this era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, contrasting with the average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the stars in the Pleyad cluster
The last mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of the rotational speeds of the stars in the Pleyad.
New data help astronomers to understand why the stars in a cluster are rotating at different speeds, and how the rotating periods relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that, by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleyad is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now just getting ripe; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak speeds of rotation, these growing stars emit large amounts of star wind.
By traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds act as a brake on the stars.
As the star grows older, its rate of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as solar spots.
The newest rate-of-turn catalog suggests that more massive stars are spinning slower than smaller stars.
The fishball compares the stars to the dancers: the larger ones make the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the ballet, we see that those that are moving slowly, usually more massive, while those that are moving faster tend to be very light stars," Ribal said.
As the Pleyad's cluster is so close, it is the perfect space lab to compare the properties of the stars with the speed of rotation.
"The planetary cluster of the Pleyad provides a starting point for theoretical models of rotation of stars, both younger and older," Ribal said.
We still want to learn a lot about how, where, and why the stars slow down their rotations and hang their "dancing shoes" on a nail, figuratively.
Ribal and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the speeds of the Pleiades in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation of a group of Ukrainian delinquents in Crimea is conducted by two departments, writing “Commersant”.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of sabotages in Crimea.
As previously reported, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation, gave a confession.
He said that he viewed the chemical plant Titan in Armenia, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerchen ferry, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airfields as targets for sabotage.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all subversive partners have been apprehended.
This has led, inter alia, to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Riyes of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Cerchezov was the head coach of the Russian football team.
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislaw Cerchezov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
The contract will last for two years, until the completion of the MM-2018.
On 11 August, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislaw Cerchezov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
He was a well-known footballer who had previously played in the Moscow "Spartake" as a gatekeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was the mentor of Russian teams such as the same "Spartake", "The Pearl-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dinamo", and the Warsaw "Legia", who had become the winner of the country's national supremacy and cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cerchezov will be signed as soon as possible for a period of two years.
It is therefore incumbent upon him to prepare for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that Miroslav Romachchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikiv will be part of his training staff.
There's information that the whole coach's office's salary will be 2.6 billion euro a year.
According to the media, the Russian Federation has set Stanislaw Cerchezov as the target of bringing the Russian team to the semi-final and winning the medals.
As the coach himself said, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team to be a priority, and he is going to give the footballers an opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Churchesov, he's glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match, led by the Russian Churches, will be held on 31 August in Antalya, a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Recall that Leonid Slutsky had previously been the head coach of the Russian football team, who combined him with the coaching at the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after a failed presentation by the Russian national team on Euro-2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad score of the team.
Embarrassed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, that country, with a population of 2.4 million, has made tremendous progress, particularly in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is because the Government attaches great importance to education.
While people in developed countries perceive free primary and secondary education as self-evident, in many poor countries secondary and even primary school fees are required.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce “cost-recovery” training fees.
In Namibia, however, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also been free of charge.
The authorities are also active in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Despite the international trend of rising inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to the 1993 figure, the Gini coefficient, the standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
At the time, 23 years ago, that figure was one of the highest in the world.
And the poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) also declined, from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rate of free speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country was far ahead of the United States and other rich nations.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the "Perception of Corruption Index", which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25 per cent, less than one third of the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The rate of unemployment, at least in the traditional method of estimation, is still relatively high - almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS infection - almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is one of the countries with higher-middle incomes, but the authorities insist that their State is in fact a developing country.
Namibia is, of course, facing some of the difficulties inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The State has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
In the country, isolated nomad tribes of hunter-gatherers live in the deserts, who in one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who had been on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia had not thought to give up, but it was tackling the problems it faced.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities had begun to create a diversified economy and a united society.
Significantly, rival political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides low-cost health care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health-care facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia talks about the construction of a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that the neighbours did not choose, so they decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to promote investment, and to exchange students.
Moreover, the Namibian Government had rightly reasoned that rich natural resources could easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that Namibia ' s natural wealth should be invested in infrastructure and productive capacities.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to pursue the maximum profit from the sale of the country ' s resources, and are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that is the case.
Transparentness is crucial to this process, so the strong support of the Government for free speech is so important.
As the Head of State Hage Gaingob pointed out, the media often say things he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has acquired, says the President.
Not all of Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some - such as fishing - are renewables, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and underdevelopment - can embark on the path to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard of the Golden Varna, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 B.C.E.).
Perhaps it was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, when the Necropolis was dug up, a fantastic number of gold artifacts was found -- over three thousand to a total weight of six kilograms.
Only 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg were extracted from one grave, known as the "43 Mobile".
However, the official status of the world’s ancient gold may soon shift to the unseen bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
Again in Bulgaria, a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yuncite.
In contrast to Varna, a port city, Tell Yunacite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunacite Pazarjik.
The bushin is a golden strip wrapped in a ring.
Javor Bojadjiyev, head of excavation at Telle Yuncite, dated the discovery in 4600 B.C.E. and claimed to be at least 200 years older than Varna's gold.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date to about the same period, from 4600 to 4,200 B.C.E.
There is currently no technology to date the metal with perfect accuracy.
How can we be sure of what gold is more ancient?
Evidently, Professor Bojadjiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I'm pretty sure the gold is older than Varna's."
It's a find of extreme importance: it looks like a small object, but it's big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Bojadjiev, scientists will soon analyse the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead as precisely as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Yuncite is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Tell Yuncite is now considered the oldest “city” of Europe.
Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium B.C.E.
Over the next centuries, the processing of metals in the region has been booming, ranging from the first metallurgical skills to the establishment of a full-fledged industry.
In the national history of this archaeological community, the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province is a special name.
In the 5th millennium B.C.E., urban settlements began to emerge around metal processing centers.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yuncite may be the oldest, as artifacts from 4,900 B.C.E. were found here.
I'd call Tell Yuncite a modern city prototype, though it's a very ancient settlement, even in comparison to Mesopotamia.
"This is a place older than Schumer for a thousand years," says Bojajiyev, in view of the generally accepted view that urban culture was born in the south of Mesopotamia - modern Iraq.
The first cities in the common sense of the word emerged.
It has been excavated since 1976.
During that time, archaeologists dug up almost 12 acres, about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The rest of the fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, was found.
There is little left of houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, public buildings, urban dense construction, business centre, and outskirts.
Tell Yuncite is often referred to as "The Bird's City", where dozens of earthy bird figures were found.
All the birds were pictured in a state of rest, so it was assumed that they were not decorative objects, but objects of local worship.
The Bird City was demolished about 4100 B.C., possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
Nomads had no cities, but horses and guns.
The three-metre fortresses didn't stop them.
Archaeologists have found clear signs of a brutal slaughter: the remains of old men, women and children with traces of wounds caused by axes have been found inside the houses.
New discoveries and new facts emerge every year, altering the way we view the ancient history of mankind.
The Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” first civilization of Europe, born in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive in the search for this civilization was the “Gold of Varna” found relatively recently in 1972.
Logically, Varna's golden luxury had to precede something - a sort of tiny golden bead created in Telle Yuncite.
In Porsche, the 911 Targa model was artificially old.
It is officially stated that the training of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by a unit that works with serial machines.
The "Retro-Luck" is, for example, in the special color of the Etna Blue bodywork, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, in which the logo of the model is painted.
In addition, the Targa received a special white chart along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel drives, as well as some parts of the bodywork that had been painted in white-gold metal.
In the interior of the retro-charts, it is markedly smaller: it differs, in large part, in the gray-blue gamma, in new seats with extended ranges of electrical adjustment, and in black anodized steel-separated thresholds with the unit logo.
In addition, when a special version is bought, each buyer will receive a car cover and a rich, separate album with photographs of the production process.
The Porsche Exclusive power plant is not to touch steel: the retro-targ is very similar to the series.
It is equipped with a turbocharged six-cylinder engine of 3.0 litre, which produces 420 litre and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in limited circulation, but neither the volume nor the cost of each particular sporting car will be reported.
Facebook and the ad blockers started an "arms race"
The recent introduction of Facebook's technology to prevent social media ads from being concealed has prompted decision makers to block advertising in response.
At the AdBlock Plus, they released the antidote, but Facebook is about to make it worthless.
So AdBlock Plus has propounded its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
Social media representatives noted that, in an effort to defraud the new technology of “unlocked” ads, the decision from AdBlock Plus, along with commercial ads, is blocking many regular posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook, they deplored this AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among the social media developers of TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop will be ready in the coming hours.
So the social network and the blockers started a sort of "arms race," trying to beat each other, and the affected party was the users who missed the interesting records from their friends or saw the ads where they weren't used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of the blocking of advertising in recent times have given rise to intense controversy.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought to trial · Evening Murmansk.

Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a member of China's growing car class, which combines the merits of a minivan with a sneaker.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western firms of the Moscow International Automobile this year have decided to ignore, so the emptiness of the Crocus Expo exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese companies.
In particular, a powerful front will be the Dongveng Motor, which has large sizes on the Russian market and is determined in the near future to offer our auto lovers a number of interesting novelties.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossroads sold in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (a little less than 550,000 roubles at the current rate).
The Russians are unlikely to have such a price, and the issue of transfers to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to reach number 11 on the list of top-selling minivans, although due to the high road eclipse (175 mm) and the protection of plastic over the lower circumferential of the body, it can well be ranked as a sneaker.
Crosswen is built on a front-drive platform of the smaller Fengguang 360 model, 370 has a similar wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is a bit longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon was decorated with wooden bars, but the large vertical sensor screen "like the Tesla's" on the central console was only on the early expositions of the cross-vene, and the cars with the "music" were sold in a simpler way.
Five of the seven landing sites are easy to add, forming a level loading area of 1650 mm long, with a maximum boot volume of 1500 litres.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is only one-and-one-half-litre petrol "atmosphere" with a capacity of 115 ls, linked to a 5-stage mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer humbly conceals the dynamic properties of the machine, but promises a budget-sparing appetite of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is well-known to the Russians, the Nissan NP300 Navara of the last generation, but with a bit of Chinese style design.
Despite the morally outmoded design, this model still enjoys a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unfavorable “work horse.”
At a similar price, Rich New is likely to interest Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for choice: 2.4 litre petrol (137 litres) or 2.5 litre turbodies (116 litres).
The gearbox is only a mechanic, the drive is to the rear wheels, but there are modifications to the gearbox with a rigidly plugged "front".
It will be on the Dongfeng stand and the new flagman sedan A9, and its Russian Prime Mission of the Chinese firm was announced as early as June.
Minveno-like crossovers on the Chinese market are on the rise, and one of the most recent is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Russian Dongfeng line is made up of two models: Sedan S30 and Hatchback H30 Cross.
In the seven months of this year, Chinese dealers made 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax alerts will stop posting - website Driven by www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for issuing notices of property taxes.
All Russian motorowners have become accustomed to a pattern that has not changed over the years: in the summer and the fall, they receive an e-mail ticket to pay the previous year's transport tax.
This year, however, many will not be able to wait.
The fact is that the tax inspection has changed the way citizens are notified.
For those who are registered in the Tax Payer's Office on the official website of the agency nalog.ru, the notices will come in electronic form.
In the inspection, the Russians were automatically considered to be online users and erased from the standard, paper-based mailing.
The novel will affect all owners of vehicles and real property.
The rest of us will still get the usual letters.
However, it is possible to get back to the old scheme, too, by the owner of the account on the website.
In order to do so, they will have to visit the tax office during the month of August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notice will appear in the "personal office" as soon as it is written, while the letter will go for a few days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of Internet users of the tax inspection service has overstretched 18 million people, which will enable the office to save a lot of money on the mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some may have registered in a private office for a one-time service and have long forgotten it.
These people will not wait to be notified by mail, and without knowing it, they will become insolent, with all the consequences.
The “Personal Office of the taxpayer” is accessed in three ways: through the account of the Gosuslugi.ru Portal, by means of an electronic signature, or by means of the login and passphrase specified in the login card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any tax inspectorate office (whether the place of registration).
We recall that this year the transport tax must be paid by 1 December.
The dispatch of the notices began in July.
The Mercedes-Benz G-class, which is designed to achieve very high returns, is a thing in itself.
But the debatable concept did not confuse the G-Power's masters, who started to modify the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G- powerer is known for his addiction to BMW cars, but nothing is human to its masters.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63-571-strong flyer sled with tank aerodynamics and up to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
By inflating the "muscles" of the crazy "helics," the masters took advantage of the 5,5-litre supercharged "8."
And the shift to a hundred has improved by the indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "kirpich" is capable of a 5.3 s leap.
However, he's probably getting a lot better at the average speeds.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if standard G 63 is not moving faster than 210 km/h, a tubed all-road with a deactivated electronic collar can reach 250 km/h.
Outside the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory source, with the exception of other wheel drives - 23-inch Hurricane RR size 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach suite announced an amazing six-metre concept coupé, which will be presented at the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "green subbrand" BMW i and will promote its electrical models under a separate trade mark.
A minimum of four green new developments are expected in the coming years.
