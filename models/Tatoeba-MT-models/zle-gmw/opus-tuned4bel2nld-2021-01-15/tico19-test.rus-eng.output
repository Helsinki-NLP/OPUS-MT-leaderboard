The coronavirus infection (COVID-19) rate in the European Union and in the United Kingdom is growing rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
Communicable coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the EU/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, despite different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Taking into account Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve the level of preparedness for COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown ethos were reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province of China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the new type of coronavirus, now known as the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory Syndrome Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the source of the infection.
From that point on, the disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 became known as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available to date, about 80 percent of people with COVID-19 have an easy-to-do disease, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them are recovering.
In about 14% of the cases COVID-19 is developing into a more severe form of hospitalization, while in the rest 6% is in a critical form when intensive treatment is required.
The death rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is about 4%.
This study examines the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the United Kingdom, and compares them with those in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is currently developing in the rest of the world in the same way as China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 Pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the incidence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were recorded in France on 24 January 2020, all three of them coming back from Wuhan, Hubei.
As at 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had detected cases of COVID-19, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750, including 1,441 fatal cases, were reported in Italy alone.
Definition of the cumulative quantity and cumulative disease of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8 a.m. data on the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources, such as the ministries of health of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom and to compare them with data for Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, the sum of the cumulative COVID-19 incidence in 14 days was calculated, taking into account the normal COVID-19 current in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom
Trends in the 14-day Cumulative Cumulative Prevalence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom in general corresponded to trends in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
Cumulative COVID-19 incidence in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom as a whole began to rise around 21 February, and a sharp leap (additional material) occurred on 28 February 2020.
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom similar trends have been observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, compared to the same for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded at 8 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results indicate a rapid increase in the number of registered COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this is despite the different steps in different countries, the differences in the response of national public health authorities, and perhaps the different criteria for the recognition of cases, and the different rules for the selection of patients for COVID-19 testing, including “up-to-date” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already as full as possible.
To date, data on the admission of patients from COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) the EU/EEA intensive care unit are only available for 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases, respectively (not reported).
However, there is a need to systematically collect such data in order to supplement the current data on the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.
According to a 2010 - 2011 study, in Europe there is a significant gap in the number of beds in intensive care and in intensive care, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth update of the ECDC on the results of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment presents scenarios for the modelling of the uploading of health system resources with estimates of the hospitalization of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, where the risk of a shortage of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90 per cent.
As the cases are currently grouped according to certain EU/EEA and British regions, and hospitals and intensive care units tend to serve the population of a specific territorial group, information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to provide, as far as possible, level 2 Nomenclatures of territorial units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom are rapidly developing the COVID-19 pandemic.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the long-term contact scenario of SARS-Cov-2 and for the increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the most recent ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and integrated approach is essential to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from containment to minimization, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have sufficient time to reflect on, adopt and adjust their responses, as appropriate, if such measures are not taken in advance.
The report on the results of the rapid risk assessment also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time in which they can step up their monitoring efforts to slow the spread of SARS-Cov-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks the health system in other EU/EEA countries will face a flood of patients who will need intensive care.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2, has become a tragedy for mankind: to date, more than 3,000 people have died in China and elsewhere, and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus, which led to the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-Cov-2 may also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower incidence of disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older persons more frequently than young men and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of new infections, this article offers a relevant and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject of the study.
We will look at basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction of the current and prevention of the disease.
While many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The spring festival (Chinese New Year), which fell on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and memorable event for all Chinese, who, in view of the outbreak of a new virus infection, were urged to stay home throughout the festival and for weeks after it.
In view of the high level of coronavirus (Cov), which led to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the virus SARS-Cov-2 on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout the country, and then in almost 50 other countries.
As at 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been detected, more than 40,000 patients had recovered, and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy to society” and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to the PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequencing of the virus from a number of patients.
The review is an attempt to synthesize the results of the studies in a new and fast-growing subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus-induced disease, the coronavirus of the Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS), which erupted in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts that are known to date on the prevention and forecasting of the current, as well as some other equally urgent issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not fatal to humans and are mostly responsible for about 15% of the general respiratory diseases.
However, in this century we have faced twice the highly pathogened coronaviruses of humans, that is, the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS-Cov), which caused an outbreak of diseases in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other States with appalling levels of disease and death.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in figure 1.1, the first report on the cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was submitted to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, a genetic sequencing of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death incident was recorded in the city of Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, health-care workers were reported to be infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted from humans to humans.
On 23 January, a quarantine was imposed in the city of Wuhan, and urban public transport ceased to function.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outburst of the coronavirus was a global public health emergency.
At the time of the preparation of the report, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2).
Given the rapid evolution of the situation, the final scale and risk of an outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centric clinical study, which involved 8,866 patients, including 4,021 with confirmed COVID-19, provided the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-Cov-2 has been infected by all age groups, but most people between the ages of 30 and 65 have been infected.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, very few under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-COV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusters mainly in the province of Hubei and in the surrounding regions.
On average, it lasted 5 days from the time the symptoms of COVID-19 were exposed to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0–7.2).
From the time of the symptoms to the time of death, an average of 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The base ratio (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the corrected R0 was 2.23-4.8.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons, which coincided with large-scale transport on the eve of China's New Year's celebration.
The death rate for confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10 - 1.86%) and the adjusted death rate for patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02 - 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 contamination were: sex (male), age (×60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one thread of the RNA.
They can be divided into four kinds, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta viruses are known to affect humans.
In the case of coronaviruses of type SARS and MERS, glycoprothein of spice-shaped strata (S) is linked to cell receptors of type 2 angiotenzine converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidesis 4 (DPP4), respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
In the cytoplasm, the virus RNA gene is released; after replication of the virus genome, the genome RNA, along with the luxurious glycoprothenes and proteins of the nucleocopsis, produces viron-containing vectors, which then merge with the membrane cell, releasing the virus.
The first genomic sequencing reports of SARS-Cov-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
The SARS-Cov-2 is found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus, whose genome is 99.98% consistent with the 10 sequential samples collected in the first outbreak of the disease, in the Juanan seafood market in Wuhan.
==History==SARS-Cov-2 is genetically closer to SARS-Cov than to MERS-Cov.
SARS-COV-2 particles were detected in ultra-tone human air epithelia by means of an electron-transmitted microscope.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-Cov-2, as well as for SARS-Cov.
However, the S-protein SARS-Cov-2 links to the ACE2 human enzyme less than the SARS-Cov, which explains the fact that SARS-Cov-2 causes patients to have a lower degree of illness than SARS-Cov.
SARS-Cov-2 can also produce an orf3b-coded, previously unknown short-lived protein and an orf8-coded secret protein.
Orf3b of the SARS-CV-2 virus can play a role in terms of the virus's pathogenity and suppress the expression IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a group of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) submitted a report on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-length ACE2 human enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 Å at the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed information, was collected as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-protenins, which is evidence of coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target in a drug screening to suppress the SARS-Cov-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Master
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to be the source of bats from which the virus was transmitted to humans through liquor and camels, respectively.
By means of a philogenetic comparison between SARS-Cov-2 and other coronaviruses, it was determined that the first owners of SARS-Cov-2 are bats, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely the coronaviruses of the SL-CovZX45 and SL-CovZX21.
However, it is not known which kind has become the intermediate host, which has enabled the virus to break the species barrier and infect humans; the way of transmission is also to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the vectors of the virus from bats to humans had become snakes, resulting in a homogeneous recombination in the S-protin.
According to their research, Chinese scientists in Guangzhou suggested that pangolines, long-size mammals who feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate owners of SARS-Cov-2, which is based on a 99% genetic resemblance between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-Cov-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still very high, so it is considered that the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-Cov-2 are mostly still unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and between 40 and 50 per cent humidity.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-Cov-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heat up to 56°C for 30 minutes; the virus can be effectively blocked by ester, 75% ethyl alcohol, chlorine disinfectant, percussic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not by chlorhexide.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-COV-2, so people are receptive to the new virus.
At present, there is no data available on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-Cov-2.
So we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, especially SARS-Cov and MERS-COV (Figure 4).
Typically, the virus that hits the host first detects the inborn immune system by means of image-recognition receptors, including electron C-type receptors, toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
By means of a variety of mechanisms, the virus induces the expression of inflammation factors, the ripening of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferones, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the fagocytosis of macrophages with respect to viral antigens.
However, the SARS-Cov N-Queen can avoid immune reactions.
Soon an adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.
T-limphocytes, including the T-cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in protecting the body.
T-cells CD4+ stimulate the production of virus-specific antibodies in B-cells, and T-cells CD8+ directly kill virus-infected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory citocines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T cell functions, causing them to be programmed to die.
Humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies from a recovering patient neutralized MERS-Cov.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system results in the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst scenario lead to polyorganic failure and even death.
The SARS-Cov-2 infection, which is characterized by clustering, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The risk of infection is higher for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have immune disorders.
According to the data from the first 425 cases in the city of Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period SARS-Cov-2 is between 1 and 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, with a difference of between 0 and 24 days.
A later study based on the demography of 8,866 cases showed that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2).
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time frame of the quarantine measures imposed to take account of the most accurate calculation of the length of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected with the disease without any symptom.
It is common practice to have a 14-day quarantine for persons who have had contact with the virus or are infected with the virus.
Should the period of quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often high temperature, which can be the only symptom, or may be accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty in breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, sniffing, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
A week after the outbreak of the disease, some patients suffered from breath and (or) hypoxia.
In severe cases, the disease has progressed rapidly, and patients have developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulosis.
High-temperature patients and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathologies in the chest.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following prevalence rates: 98%, high temperature, 76%, dry cough, 55%, and 3%, diarrhea; 8% of the patients required artificial ventilation of their lungs.
Similar results have been obtained from the last two studies of cases of contagion in the family and transmission of the virus from non-symptomic infections.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of MERS-Cov patients, who also had high temperatures (98%), dry cough (47%) and breath (55%).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial ventilation of their lungs, which is much higher than for patients with COVID-19, and corresponds to a higher mortality rate for MERS than for COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperature (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), breath (40–42%), diarrhea (20–25%) and throat pain (13–25%), and artificial ventilation of the lungs is required from 14–20%.
As at 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide was 66,576.
By November 2002, the mortality rate for SARS was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a population study conducted in June 2012 showed a death rate of 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to an earlier study, the base ratio (R0) for SARS-Cov-2 was set at 6.47 at 95% of the confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above figures show a higher potential for SARS-Cov-2 proliferation than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but the mortality rate for the new virus is lower than the last two.
So it will be much harder to contain the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV epidemics.
Cluster displays often occur when infected within the same family or group of people who have come together for any reason or have come together on any transport, e.g. on a cruise ship.
Patients have often travelled to the city of Wuhan or to other affected regions, lived there or had contact with the infected or the sick in the last two weeks prior to the outbreak of the disease.
However, according to the data provided in the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients can again become carriers of the virus, and this is a warning signal for the extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 have been diagnosed with white cell levels < 4×109/L, including white cell levels < 1×109/L, as well as an increased level of aperture-aminotransphrase and virus.
Some patients found elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in their blood, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erection of red blood cells.
In the case of severely affected patients, the D-dimer level, the product of the fibrine decomposition present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was steadily decreasing.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 have found pathologies in the chest X-rays, with diverging obscurities on both sides or in the form of “matter glass” in their lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary damage, and acute respiratory disease.
In the case of the development of an EPR, the uncontrollable inflammation, the accumulation of liquids and the progressing fibrosis result in a significant disruption of the gas exchange.
The pneumocytes of Types I and II reduce surface-activities and increase surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and the risk of a drop in the lungs.
Thus, the worst X-ray results are often the same as the worst cases.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed the decoupling of pneumotic cells, the formation of hyalin membrane and intertwined lymphocytary infiltration, and multi-nuclear syncytic cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease corresponded to the pathology of the viral infection and the ORZ, similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the method of detecting the RNA SARS-CoV-2 by means of a polymeraceous chain reaction with a back-transcryption (CPR with a back-transcryption).
However, in view of the high level of false negative results that can accelerate the epidemic, China began to diagnose from 13 February 2020 on the basis of clinical evidence (not relying solely on the back-transcrypted PCR).
The same was true of the SARS diagnosis.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine the data from the history of the disease, clinical events, laboratory tests and the results of the X-ray study.
On February 14, 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the protocol for the application of SHERLOCK, based on a repetitive CRISPR, to detect SARS-Cov-2; this method allows for the identification of synthetic fragments of the SARS-Cov-2 RNA at a density of 20 × 10-18 moles/l to 200 × 10-18 moles/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of the origin) with less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new method, if successfully tested for clinical drugs, can greatly increase the sensitivity and user-friendliness of the tests.
Due to the lack of experience in countering the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors are generally able to provide patients with COVID-19 only with support therapy, while trying to use any therapeutic methods used or offered in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other virus diseases (table 2.2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-virus drugs, immunizers, steroids, plasma of healed patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It was suggested that even the plasma of cured patients should be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to control the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-Cov-2 attacks mainly the lungs, as well as possibly less the other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys.
However, work failure and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of the death of patients.
Thus, in order to alleviate the symptoms and save lives, it is critical to support the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which is determined by the severity of the current.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulatory method used to treat a life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of the water-salt balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organs are critical to patients with SARS-CV-2.
It is known that the cytokin storm is the result of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with the viruses SARS and MERS.
The Cytokin storm is a form of a system inflammatory process that develops in response to the selection of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN# and MCP-1.
These citocins cause immunocytes to emit huge quantities of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of RHDs and polyorganic insufficiency.
In the treatment of the cytokin storm, particularly in the case of patients in serious condition, the suppression of immunity is of the utmost importance.
Corticosteroids and tozilysumab, monoclonic antibodies, served as interlakin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat the cytokin storm.
Other treatments for the cytokin storm based on the suppression of immunity include the modulation of the immune response to control of the T cell; the blocking of the production of the Cytokine IFN-1, IL-1, and TNF; the suppression of the Janus-kinase; the use of pancake-tomob, cytokine sensors 4 and histondeacetalas ingibiters.
Steroids are widely used as immunities to reduce the impact of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses.
However, high dosage steroids are not useful in treating severe pulmonary injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially awascular osteonocrosis, which significantly worsens the prediction.
However, short courses for corticosteroids in small and medium dosages are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective anti-virus therapy.
However, the intravenous introduction of the remdesvire, the nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for the American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivere is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola viruses and the Marburg virus.
Later, the Remdesire also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with single-chain RNAs, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this data, Gilead has provided this drug to China for a couple of studies on patients infected with SARS-Cov-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavirus/ritonavirus and fishavirus were offered as options for treatment for acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination treatment with lopinavirus/ritonavirus may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver failure and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs assigned to patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibodies
The collection of blood from patients recovering from contagious disease has been used for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease or for the protection of a healthy population for a long time.
In fact, the blood of healed patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to combat pathogen.
The antibodies are in the immunoglobulin, produced by B-limphocytes to control pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from blood samples of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19, which was then injected with 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the acuteness of the inflammation and the viral load decreased, and the saturation of the blood with oxygen increased.
However, to suggest that this method should be applied in a mass manner before specific treatment is carried out, it is necessary to have the untested and unexplained.
In addition, in view of the therapeutic effect, some deficiencies in the use of plasma should be carefully studied.
For example, antibodies can over-instimate the immune system and cause Cytokin Syndrome, which, given the toxicity, is a potential risk to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma is needed to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
It is therefore more important and more practical to separate the B-cells of healed patients and to identify the genetic code of effective antibodies or screen to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can go straight to the mass production of antibodies.
For millennia, Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat a variety of diseases.
Its effectiveness, however, depends to a large extent on a combination of multiple components of the formula, which differs from the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to select and test these components or their optimal mix.
At present, due to the lack of effective specific treatment of COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternatives to the treatment of patients with mild and moderate symptoms, or for patients recovering from the severe stage of the disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rate of recovery with COVID-19 was found in a number of provinces in China, where 87 per cent of patients were treated with Chinese traditional medicine, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ninx (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hubei, where only about 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 were treated with Chinese traditional medicine, the lowest rate of recovery (13 per cent).
This is, however, a rather rude comparison, since the evaluation must take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively in Western medicine and combined treatment in Western and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time frame for normalizing body temperature, correcting symptoms and providing hospital care was considerably lower for patients who had been treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who had been treated only in Western medicine.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who started to deteriorate from mild to severe was markedly lower in the group that was treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group that was treated by Western methods only (7.4 per cent, compared to 46.2 per cent), and the death rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8 per cent, compared to 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the efficiency and security of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more carefully monitored studies on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest if possible to have a description of the mechanism for action and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine or a combination of them.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are mostly acutely fearful of acutely contagious and even fatal diseases, while those who are in quarantine also suffer from boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of the SARS virus, a number of mental diseases were reported, including chronic depression, high anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotorism, psychotic symptoms, deliriums, and even suicidal behaviour.
Compulsory contact monitoring and quarantine, which are among the measures taken by the health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase the anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and mental care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to persons under suspicion and in contact with them, as well as to all others who require it.
In the context of psychological support, multi-professional mental health teams should be set up, clear information should be provided with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Efficient vaccines play an important role in interrupting the chain of transfer from animal vectors and infected people to receptive hosts, and are often used in addition to anti-virus therapy to contain the epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been carried out on the development of S-prothein-based vaccines to develop long-lived and high-active antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
In the course of animal studies, live, weakened SARS virus vaccines have been developed.
However, the impact of these possible vaccines in the natural environment in the case of age patients, the lethal dose model and the degree of protection against the infection of zoonic viruses need to be determined before the start of the clinical studies.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS virus-induced diseases are still emerging in the Middle East and spread to other regions, thanks to the conservation of zoonic sources in the endemics.
In order to combat MERs, vaccination strategies have been developed using the virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles and elements of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been assessed on animals.
The development of a safe and effective anti-SARS-Cov-2 vaccine for those who do not enjoy immunity is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed in order to contain the rampant epidemic.
However, the long time (on average 18 months) required for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic transformation of the coronaviruses pose serious challenges.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical current of the disease at the cost of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients have been able to recover gradually without complication.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with the high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease in order to determine the priority of their interventions, particularly in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the current clinical data, the following factors may affect the prediction of the current of the disease in patients with COVID-19 or be linked to it (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the current of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 hits mainly patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50, according to the above-mentioned study, 8,866.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have initial diseases and complications, and they were much older than those who did not need such treatment (average 66 years versus 51 years), which suggests that age is a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-Cov-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Sickness and complication: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to develop acute myocardial and arrhythmic damage.
Cardiology was also the main cause of death for patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-Cov-2 could also be linked to ACE2-positive cholera cells, which could cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely intertwined and can distort results.
Deviations identified in laboratory studies: the C-reactive protein level in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and is proposed to be considered a potential prognostic factor in the current, reaction to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between the C-reactive protein level, the severity of the disease and the prognosis at COVID-19 should be taken into account.
In addition, increased levels of lactatedehydrogenase, aminotransphrase aperture, alanin-aminotransverse and creatinzinase can also predict the result.
These enzymes are in large quantities separated by different organs, especially the heart and the liver, and they are released when the tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiovascular or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: In order to predict results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, data from the X-ray chest and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account, along with other factors.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunities that are commonly used in communicable diseases as complementary therapies to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors have developed awascular osteonocerosis, which has led to life-long disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if the use of steroids is necessary for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, the drugs should be given in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unanticipated severe stress, as they often have to withstand long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty, and observe the death of their relatives and other patients.
In order to ease the stress of such patients and help them to return to normal life, psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided.
According to the demographic studies carried out so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in lower respiratory paths, the SARS-Cov-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in upper respiratory paths and cause weak symptoms or no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who are in the early stages of the disease or who have not yet finished the incubation period may, through their normal life, spread the virus on a significant scale, making it very difficult to control epidemiology.
However, it was believed that the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus occurred when patients were seriously ill, while in most cases the infection did not occur at an early stage.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it's harder to control.
China is currently in the process of establishing a universal quarantine in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring cities, as well as extending the quarantine regime for almost the entire population, which has been put in place to break the proliferation chain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While these measures have caused enormous damage to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new patients being identified is declining, which is an indication of a slower spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will be over by March, and the fading phase will last 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues estimated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than the SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) have developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and have suggested that the SARS-Cov-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian experts reported that the SARS-Cov-2 virus had been detected in swabs from the nose and throat of patients who had recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclic disease similar to the flu.
However, the decline in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, pointing out that the strategies currently in place may have had an impact.
Initial predictions suggest that Ebola was expected to affect up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.
But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to control it.
It is likely that, like the SARS-Cov virus, the infective potential of the SARS-Cov-2 virus can be weakened, and will eventually disappear or become a less pathogenous virus coexisting with humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SARS-Cov-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also detected in the cripple, which means that an oral-fecular method of transmission is also possible.
According to a recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, particularly health-care workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders, who have contact with patients or are infected.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the face; and the surgical masks and N95 respirators (Serie No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgeon masks prevent micro-capsules from spreading from potentially infected liquids in the air and from settling on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect against the inhalation of viruses of 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5% of the virus; the SARS-Cov-2 virus of the same size as the SARS-Cov, both of which are about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, health professionals in direct contact with patients must wear N95 masks (Serie No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health workers should wear a uniformed protective robe to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also reach the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that he wore a Class N95 mask; the virus may have hit his body through his inflammated eyes.
Therefore, health-care workers should also wear transparent face-screens or closed-circuits.
All populations in affected or potentially at risk regions are urged to wash their hands with disinfectant washing tools more frequently, to try to stay home with self-insulation, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
A reasonable distance to a patient is a distance of about one metre.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-Cov-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high level of its resemblance to SARS-Cov, as reported on 7 January 2020, was to be a warning to China, taking into account the experience it had gained during the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan calmed the population, reporting that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproduction from person to person, and that the prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement has greatly reduced social tensions, particularly at a time when the whole country was preparing for the celebration of China's New Year, and a critical time has been lost when the disease could be contained within the city of Wuhan with minimal losses.
China's health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more careful public statements, since each word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more resolute measures to contain the potential epidemic in the early stages of its development rather than to reassure the public; and (4) conduct more focused and effective training to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly monitor and improve the public response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the previously unexplored coronavirus of severe acute respirator Syndrome Type II (SARS-Cov-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease had spread throughout China and, at the time of writing, had spread to 50 countries in the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the severe acute respirator syndrome (SARS-Cov) coronavirus, and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of acute acute respirator syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a relapse of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are relevant to the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men more than women; the incidence of severe cases and the mortality rate among older persons is also higher than among young people.
SARS deaths are higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unsymptomized, while patients with SARS tend to infect others only in severe cases, so it is harder to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-Cov-2 is spread much faster and larger than SARS-Cov.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal RNA samples for SARS-Cov-2.
On the other hand, cured patients can again show positive tests for the virus.
All of this greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
Against the background of this rapid evolution of COVID-19 studies, some critical issues remain to be resolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 percent homologue between SARS-Cov-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that SARS-Cov-2 infection was from bats.
What kind of animal has become an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the way of transmission, and the epidemiology can escalate at any moment.
Molecular modelling and biochemistry have shown that SARS-Cov-2 is linked to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus infiltrate airway cells and induce later pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to those questions, we cannot provide a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in the process of human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, or will it disappear just like SARS, or will it relapse from time to time like a flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
But we have no choice but, whatever the cost, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to return to normal life.
Zoonous origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated co-evolence of coronaviruses (Cov) and their hosts, including humans, for millennia.
Prior to 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCov) cause a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening a human coronavirus can be.
The appearance of a coronavirus of severe acute type 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CV-2) in central China in late 2019 again attracted attention to the coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmission, but less pronounced pathogens of the virus than the associated SARS-CoV virus.
A coronary human infection is a zoonosis, and an understanding of its zoonic origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogens.
There are also known intermediate carriers of some human coronaviruses.
The definition of animal carriers has a direct impact on the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Research on coronaviruses can also shed light on coronavirus pathogens in humans.
In this review, we present available data on the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonic origins and modes of interspecies transfer.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic caused by the coronavirus found in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of hosts and the effect of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar RNA thread.
These viruses with the largest RNA-containing genome, which contains between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides, have been named because of their form, which, when viewed under an electronic microscope, is like a crown.
From a structural point of view, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with the same organization.
About two thirds of the genome contains two large open, overlapped read frames (ORF1a and OrF1b), which are broadcast in the polyprothenes of the app1a and the app1ab relics.
These polyprothenes are later reprocessed to produce 16 unstructured proteins, labeled nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading frame for structured proteins, including spice-shaped protein (S), magenta protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprothein (N).
Other coronaviruses have also coded a number of lynesy special accessor proteins.
On the basis of the differences in the sequencing of the protein \ coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma, and deltacoronaviruses), with betacoronaviruses containing most of the human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is philologic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and beta-coronaviruses is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and delta-coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecies barriers, some of which have evolved to pathogens that are dangerous to humans.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include human alphacorn viruses HCV-229E and HCV-NL63.
The remaining five beta-coronaviruses include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, the coronavirus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov), the coronavirus of the Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the coronavirus of the severe acute respirator Syndrome Type II SARS-Cov-2.
Human coronaviruses HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as cold and (or) diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recent discovery of SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenous, causing severe infectious lower respiratory diseases in relatively more patients with a higher risk of acute respiratory disease (ARS) and abnormal symptoms.
The first thread of the human coronavirus HCV-229E, B814 was extracted from a sample separated from the nostopic of patients with a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has generated more knowledge of HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were overwhelmed, and the overall death rate was about 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long-term epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease sporadicly spreading to the rest of the world.
The new coronavirus (2019-nCov), which was later renamed SARS-Cov-2, was found in 2019 and is the cause of the current coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which, as at 3 March 2020, had claimed more than 3,120 lives and more than 91,000 people had been infected.
An alarm has been received, and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have zoonic origins, their origins are bats, mice, or pets.
Numerous data sets show the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats whose organisms are well adapted to and without pathogens, but show wide-ranging genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic challenged China and the world from a medical, scientific, social, and moral point of view.
A study of the zoonic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will help to understand their natural history, the drivers of their evolution and the constraints on interspecies transport.
It may also suggest or speed up the search for the SARS-Cov-2 intermediate and amplifying container, which is very important to prevent the re-emerging of the disease in the future.
This review contains general information on the zoonic origin, inter-species transfer and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we refer to and consider the following common feature: the original viruses that gave rise to human coronaviruses are not usually pathogens for their reservoir carriers, but become pathogenous after inter-species transmission to the new host.
We are also analysing the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by reduced pathogens.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-COV-2 outbreak is also considered.
The crown viruses of animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the strain of the HCV-229E virus B814 was first extracted from a sample of the nostopic patients with a cold, various coronaviruses were found in different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been detected in recent decades.
Table 1 provides a brief history of the discovery of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCV-229E virus was extracted from samples taken from the respiratory paths of upper respiratory infections in 1966; the virus was later adapted to replication in the WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with the HCV-229E virus had cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, general malaise, and throat pain, with high temperatures and coughing in 10-20% of the cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was extracted from organ culture and from the subsequent series of massages in the brain of the sucker mice.
Clinical signs of HCV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCV-229E, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens, such as Type A flu viruses and Rhinoviruses.
Both the HCV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus are common in the world and are usually transmitted in winter at moderate latitudes.
Mostly the incubation period of the two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by a disease of about two weeks.
According to a volunteer study, healthy people infected with the HCV-229E virus have developed a common pulmonary cold.
Only a handful of patients with reduced immunity had a severe infection of the lower airway.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the “atypical pneumonia epidemic,” was the first well-documented pandemic in human history to be caused by the human coronavirus, and the virus SARS-CoV, the third known human coronavirus, was the cause of the disease.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.
In addition to the super-active proliferators, it was estimated that each of the patients could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days, and the viral stress peaked at 10 days of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV had initial muscle pains, headaches, high temperature, general malaise and chills, and later symptoms included breath, coughing, and respiratory failure.
The common deviations in the laboratory from the SARS standard are lymphopia, liver sample disorders, and a high level of creatinase.
SARS patients also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelic cell proliferation, and a rise in macrofags.
About 20 to 30 percent of the patients later need intensive care and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
Other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, the liver and the kidneys, may also be infected in such severe cases, in addition to lower respiratory tracts, usually accompanied by a cytokin storm, which may be fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
For the first time, the virus was extracted from an open biopsy of the patient's lung relative, who had come to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
In late 2004, HCV-NL63 was assigned to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
Initially, it was found to affect mainly young children, older persons and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory diseases.
HCV-NL63 is characterized by shrivelling, conjunctivitis, high temperature, and bronchiolite.
Another independent study describes the same virus from an 8-month-old boy in the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of the diseases it causes is at the start of summer, spring and winter.
HCV-NL63 is linked to a obstructive laryngitis, which is also called a croupe.
HCV-HKU1 was singled out in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCV-HKU1 is linked to an exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E, and HCV-OC43, the HCV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory diseases, was detected all over the world.
All four of the human coronaviruses, which cause out-of-hospital infections, have been well adapted to humans, and their mutation, which has led to high-pathogenous diseases, is generally unlikely, even though the incidents and their causes are unknown, as in a rare case with a more virulent subtype of HCV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has led to a serious infection of the lower airway in China.
Normally, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic by acquiring the ability to be effectively transmitted and preserved in humans.
The Coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV) was first released in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a mild 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure.
Most of the laboratory-confirmed cases took place in the Middle East, but in different European countries and Tunisia there have been cases of import and distribution through ad hoc secondary cases of contagion in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak of 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical effects of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are similar to the symptoms of acute acute respirator Syndrome (SARS), both of which are characterized by an increasing acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronaviruses.
More than 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of high-death Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (34.4 per cent) had been recorded, so MERS-CoV is considered to be one of the most deadly viruses known to humans.
From mid-December 2019, the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, identified patient clusters with pneumonia, which are now, looking back in the past, linked to the infection caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respirator Syndrome Type 2 (SARS-CV-2).
The World Health Organization announced that the continued outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-Cov-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself is known as the Coronavirus Infection 19 (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with approximately 3.4 per cent of deaths.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2 per cent and that it is 1.2 per cent outside.
SARS-COV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by a rise in temperature, cough, and breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become acute respiratory Syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses do form different branches of philogenetic tree.
SARS-Cov-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but has a greater potential for transmission than SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov.
SARS-COV-2 cases of non-symptom-free infection have been recorded, indicating that the virus is likely to spread rapidly worldwide.
A comparison and comparison of SARS-Cov-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this respect, SARS-Cov-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 is between SARS-Cov and the four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar to those most common in human coronaviruses, which cause out-of-hospital infections, including non-specific symptoms, mild symptoms, or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-Cov, a small subset of serious cases of COVID-19 can be distinguished, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, the SARS-Cov-2 transfer plan also shows interesting patterns of both human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections and SARS-Cov.
On the one hand, the transferability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it is still to be checked whether the transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 is decreasing with each subsequent transfer of the virus (i.e. the infection of each next person), as in the cases of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-Cov-2 can be found in scala samples.
We still have to answer the question of whether the felony-oral route of the transfer of SARS-Cov-2 is as significant (at least under some circumstances) as it is in the case of SARS-Cov.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-Cov-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-Cov-2, including transmission, pathogens, and sustainable distribution after a human transition.
All four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections with mild-shaped symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, it is possible that these people have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both might be the only survivors of past human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause severe diseases in humans, and people who have human coronaviruses that cause severe diseases, have simply not survived.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses need to replicate in the human body to the extent that adaptive mutations are accumulated that are countering the constraints of the host.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak lasts, and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop its transfer among humans by means of quarantine or other measures to control communicable diseases.
For many years, four extra-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing common colds in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
High-pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and reproduce in their zoonic tanks and to look for cases of human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or augmenting carriers.
SARS-Cov-2 has features such as SARS-Cov/MERS-Cov, and four HCV out-of-hospital viruses.
It's very easy to pass on as an out-of-hospital HCV, at least for the moment.
But it is more pathogenous than the out-of-hospital HCV, and less pathogen than the SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adaptable to humans and whether it will be circulating in the human environment without a container or an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, exacerbating and reservoir carriers of HCV viruses.
The animal is an evolutionary host of HCV if it transports a close-born ancestor with the same high homology at the level of nucleotides sequencing.
The ancestor virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenized in this medium.
Similarly, the host reserve is constantly transporting HCov for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of the HCV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if the HCV was only hidden in an intermediate medium right before or around the time it was taken to a human being, it was not well adapted to the new host and was often pathogen.
This intermediate medium can serve as a zoonic source of human infection and play a growing host role, allowing the virus to replicate in a zipper-like way, and then hand it over to people, increasing the incidence of human infection.
HCov can survive a dead end infection if it cannot withstand a transfer inside an intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate medium and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data have shown retrospectively that the zero patient SARS had an anomaly of contact with hunting and fishing animals (wilder).
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus is higher than that of the general population.
The Himalayan cybetes (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog in the market for live animals were the first known carriers of viruses like and almost identical to the SARS-CoV.
This was circumstantially confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all the librarians in the markets, the cases of SARS were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan cives, who live in nature or on farms and do not enter markets, had in most cases not been determined by the SARS-CoV, which led to the conclusion that the Himalayan culves could serve only as an intermediate augmenting host, not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Significantly, since 80 per cent of the various animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies for SARS-Cov, it is not possible that multiple small mammals can also be intermediate augmentation carriers.
They all seem to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
A subsequent search for a natural animal carrier, SARS-Cov, revealed a close-circuited COV of the bats, which was known as the SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3 coronavirus associated with atypical pneumonia.
These mice are positive on antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses of bats have 88-92% of the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the groundwork for a new concept that bats had become bearers of new human pathogens.
A number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-Cov) have also been detected in bats, but none of them, except one, which means WIV1, cannot be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-Cov receptor is known to be the human angiotense converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, derived from a sample of bat feces, uses ACE2 bats, liquor, and humans as a receptor for entering the cell.
It's curious that serums of recovering patients from SARS could neutralize the WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, splitting up 95% of the nucleotide homology.
Despite the high homogeneity between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent of the SARS-Cov virus, and that bats are not the direct reservoir host of the SARS-CoV virus.
The MERS-CoV is classified as the same group as the COV-HKU4 bats and the COV-HKU5 bats.
COV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipepyl-dipepidezu-4 (DPP4), to infiltrate viruses.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of the MERS-CoV virus are philogeneticly closer to the sequences of betacoronaviruses of bats detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild bats have not found a live MERS-CoV virus.
The homology of the MERS-CoV nucleotide sequences and its next of kin COV-HKU25 is only 87%.
So bats may not have been the direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-armed camels are sero-positive of antibodies specific to MERS-Cov, as well as Middle Eastern camels in many African countries.
The living MERS-Cov, which is the same as the virus found in humans, was singled out from the base swabs of single-armed camels, further confirming the role of camels as real reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimented with MERS-CoV had mild symptoms, but massive viral dispersion.
Significantly, the infected camels have released the virus not only by respiratory means, but also by fecal-oral means, which is also the main way of extracting the virus from bats.
However, there are still questions, since many confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome did not have contact with camels before the symptoms occurred, and are plausible in terms of human transmission or transmission by unknown channels, including unknown species, which are hosts of MERS-CoV.
The nucleotide nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2 per cent similar to the COV RaTG13 of the bats identified in the Asian subcolumns Rhinophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, the divergence between SARS-Cov-2 and RaTG13 is too big to attribute to them parenting.
So bats may not have been the direct reservoir host of SARS-Cov-2, unless in the future almost identical coronaviruses of bats are found.
It is assumed that the direct animal carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed on the Ugan Optic Marine Products Market, which was associated with many initial cases of COVID-19, which is an indication of a possible transfer from an animal to a human.
A number of recent studies based on metageneomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as Panis javanica (Manis javanica) could also carry the parent betacoronvirus associated with the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new genomes of the coronavirus pangolines is 85-92% the same as SARS-Cov-2.
But they are also closely linked to RaTG13, with an identity at the nucleotide sequence level of about 90%.
They are clustered into two sublines of the differentiation of viruses, such as SARS-Cov-2, in a philogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-linking domain (RSD) that is closer to SARS-Cov-2 with a 97.4 per cent amino acid sequencing.
In contrast, the SARS-CV-2 and RaTG13 RSD strains are more divisive, despite a higher degree of homology of sequencing in the entire genome.
An earlier study of pangolin patients also reported the definition of viral contiguity in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-Cov-2.
The study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to produce a sequence of the genome, which includes about 86.3 per cent of the full-length virus genome.
It is not possible to rule out the possibility that the pangoline has become one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-Cov-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequencing between the SARS-Cov-2 and the beta-coronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-Cov-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-Cov-2 from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-Cov-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-Cov-2 and the beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-Cov-2.
The evolutionary path SARS-COV-2 has not yet been set up for bats, pangolines, and other mammals.
While the highest homology of sequencing was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest homology of sequences in the genome.
Very theoretically, a high level of resemblance between the beta-coronviruses of the pangolines, related to SARS-Cov-2, and SARS-Cov-2 is linked to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposing proposal favours a recombination between the beta-coron virus of pangolines, associated with SARS-Cov-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is common among beta-coronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonic origin of SARS-Cov-2.
In addition to HCov viruses, the zoonic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 are also being studied.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E can be derived from coronaviruses of bats, while the parent viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
A coronavirus of bats, known as the ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and found in North American tricoloured suction, was reported to be a close kinship with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E is genetically linked to another coronavirus of bats called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that it might have been an intermediate bearer of camels.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
The philogenetic analysis provided evidence of the events of the HCV inter-species transmission in the anamnese.
When the HCV-OC43 virus was transmitted interspecies around 1890 and people were infected by pets, a respiratory pandemic was reported.
The history of HCV-229E interspecies is not so clear.
Alphacoronaviruses of bats, similar to HCV-229E, were found.
There's an alpaca alphacorn virus between them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who had been able to contact bats in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, the alphacoron viruses of bats associated with HCV-229E are diverse and nepathogenic in bats, while the alpaca alphacoronavirus has caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alphacorn virus was not detected in wild animals.
Thus, the probability that alpacas have received an alphacorn virus associated with HCV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola virus, Nippah virus, and Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that bats could directly pass HCV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while alphacorn viruses of bats could serve as the gene pool of the HCV-229E virus, alpacas and single-rib camels could be intermediate carriers of viruses to humans, just like the MERS-Cov virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies from bats to single-rib camels and from single-rib camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its initial identification and was later confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for the interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats “the perfect spreaders.”
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single-armed camels a decade ago.
It was well adapted to these camels, which, from an intermediate medium, had become a stable and natural reservoir medium.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low rate of mutations.
His episodic transfer to a man is an accident, and a man remains a dead end bearer of MERS-Cov, as his transfer is not supported.
In contrast to the role of the camels in the MERS-Cov transmission, the role of the pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus is different.
In particular, the beta-coronaviruses of pangolines are highly pathogenous in the pangolines.
They can be dead-end carriers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-Cov-2, as well as cybetes in the case of SARS-Cov.
In future studies, several possibilities for cross-species transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus from animals to humans need to be confirmed or eliminated.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-Cov-2, almost identical to SARS-Cov-2.
People can divide the ecological niche with bats by coal mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Second, the pangolines may be one of the intermediate amplifiers in which the associated SARS-Cov-2 virus has recently been infected.
People are infected with the virus by carcass cutting and the use of wild animals for meat.
It is possible that many animals, including home animals, are receptive to SARS-Cov-2.
The study of domestic and wild animals on antibodies is justifiable.
Third, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-Cov-2 could have taken place in a third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-COV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal carriers, the three main factors on the part of viruses have also contributed to cross-border barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the calculated rate of coronavirus mutations can be considered to be “medium-high” with an average rate of replacements of approximately 10 to 4 per year for one section 2 depending on the stage of adapting the coronavirus to the new hosts.
Coronaviruses have an exorbitant exorbonuclease, the removal of which results in an extremely high rate of mutation and loss or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogy of Remdesivere suppresses the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivere is one of the most promising anti-SARS-Cov-2 tools to be tested in clinical studies.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, the frequency of mutation can often be even higher if the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-Cov with a high mutation rate, the frequency of SARS-Cov-2 mutations is likely to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, the virus has already adapted to another medium close to humans.
In addition to SARS-Cov-2, this also applies to MERS-Cov, which is well adapted to single-armed camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that SARS-Cov-2 vaccines and antiviral drugs will quickly become ineffective as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the probability of inter-species co-evolution, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses, subject to conditions.
This is facilitated by the many unique open frame of reading and the functions of the proteins, coded in the direction of the 3-way end of the genome.
Third, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch the matrix during RNA replication.
When the DNA of the coronavirus is transcribed in the medium, which serves as a mixing container, the threads are often switched.
High-level, full-dimensional and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and in coronaviruses, such as SL-Cov and BatCoV-HKU9 bats.
Interaction between the virus and the transmission
In addition to the above three virus factors, another key factor for inter-species transfer is the interaction of the virus with the host receptor.
This article provides a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection in inter-species transfers, a recombination of the SARS-CoV.
On the basis of a comparative analysis between the strains of SARS-Cov of humans and cybetes, SARS-Cov is believed to be adapting rapidly in different media, particularly with respect to mutations to RSD of S protein.
In general, the RSD of the squirrel S coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor, and the antibodies of the host actively select it.
The SARS-CoV RSD is an amino acid, from 318 to 510, on a fragment of S1, which links the virus to the angiotensin-preventive enzyme 2 (APF2) of humans, as well as to its cohorts.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD can detect APF2 receptors of different animals, including bats, civates, mice, and raccoons, making it possible to transfer the virus interspecies.
In fact, only six amino acid residues have been found in the RSD, which are different from human viral strains and cybetes, four of which are in a receptor-binding motive for interacting with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-Cov cyves have mutations of K479N and S487T in the RSD, which may increase the affinity of the spine-shaped protein to the human receptor of APF2.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important for adapting the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-Cov-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-Cov.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-COV in S1-segment squirrel leads to the possible change of the S-squirrel affinity to human APF2.
In fact, the cryoelectronic microscope study suggests that the affinity of this connection is 10 to 20 times higher than between APF2 and the S-protein of the SARS-CoV virus.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other correceptors were needed for the transfer of SARS-Cov-2.
Surprisingly, HCV-NL63 is also linked to APF2 but to another segment of the S protein.
There are many other HCov receptors, such as N aminopeptidesis for HCV-229E and 9-O-acetyl acid for HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for successfully adapting these coronaviruses to humans after interspecies from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the HCV interspecies transfer is also controlled by other factors of dependence and restraint of the host.
Divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural HCVs reservoir carriers, such as bats, single-rib camels and rodents, can represent a barrier to interspecies transfer.
For successful inter-species transmission of HCV viruses, it is necessary to usurp the factors of dependence and to subdue the factors of restraction of hosts.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important field of interaction between the virus and the host still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can result in an unbiased full-genomic screening of the dependency and restructuring of hosts for SARS-Cov-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
Emerging new HCV: back to zero
The diversity of the coronaviruses of bats offers a wide range of opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, the coronaviruses of bats serve as a genetic pool for HCov.
In addition, fast mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind the evolution of HCov and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the Accessor Proteins, SARS-Cov is considered to be important for adapting to humans, as the viruses of bats associated with SARS-CoV have been isolated, but have been found to be coding orF8 divergent proteins.
In the strains isolated at the start of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide devolusion that is characteristic of the SARS-CoV coronaviruses was discovered.
This division breaks the OrF8 into OrF8a and OrF8b, and is considered to be an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-coronaviruses, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The localization of the recombination was also defined in non-structural nsp9, most nsp10, and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV had been subject to recombinant events between different lines, which had occurred in single-track camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCovs, where HCov recombined with other animals in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial breeding can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which are likely to result from the release of the virus from the resulting sequestration pressure, for example, on the part of the host immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-length orF4 in the prototype strain HCV-229E due to a bi-nucleotide division.
While the intact open frame of ORF4 can be observed in the viruses of the bat and the camel associated with HCV-229E, the alpaca alphacoronavirus displays a single-nucleotide box, leading to a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCV is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoir carriers.
Infected by bats with coronaviruses, low or no symptoms were recorded, indicating that coronaviruses and bats were mutually adapted.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, a defect in the activation of the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduces the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed by the apregulation of the inhibitor receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low level of expression of the molecules of the main Class I complex.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen, which is produced by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, while influencing the reading of exoribonuclease, thus creating a selection pressure to produce strains of the virus, which, when penetrate the new host, are highly pathogenous.
The more pathogenic strains of the coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or the properties of the protein to adapt to the host.
So it is no accident that in the last 20 years, three new human coronaviruses have emerged.
Coronaviruses are nepathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They replicate with confidence, without triggering a strong immune response from the host.
That is the secret to why we see unsympathetic hosts, and what causes the serious cases of human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly associated with the hyperactive immune response and the cytokin storm, in which the more acute the immune response, the more severe the lung failure.
On the contrary, the immune response of unsymptomic carriers does not involve the replication of the coronavirus.
The same anti-immune response strategy can have positive effects in therapy against SARS-Cov-2.
The bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, the use of type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of the SARS-Cov-2 infection, should have a positive effect on humans.
In addition, the bats have been deactivated by NLRP3-inflamoma.
On this basis, the inhibition of NLRP3-inflamoma with MCC950 can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-Cov-2 follows the general pattern of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov.
While the bat betacoronavirus, whose nucleotide homology is 95% the same as SARS-CoV, is found, there is also a bat coronavirus, whose nucleotide homology is 96% the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that cybetes and other animals in the markets are transporting viruses that are the same as SARS-Cov, there have been no direct intermediates for SARS-Cov-2.
Pangolin beta-coronviruses were found, astonishingly homologic SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the pangolins could be one of the intermediate hosts, or that fragments of the genes of the pangolin beta-coronviruses could be included in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-Cov-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
Coronaviruses have attracted general attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-Cov-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonic origin and HCV animal reserves in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-Cov, MERS-COV, and SARS-Cov-2 are from bats and have been handed over to the person via intermediate hosts.
If the SARS-Cov infection stems from contact between humans and cives in the marketplace, the closing of the wild markets and the destruction of the civiels in them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of a wide range of beta-coronviruses, close to SARS-CoV-2, the Pangolines should be removed to prevent the zoonic transmission of infection from the food markets.
However, whether SARS-Cov-2 is passed to humans through pangolines and other mammals, and how this can be done, remains the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-row camels.
These camels are an important vehicle as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin and wool for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for control of MERs, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2.
In order to stop the intermittent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, combined with other infectious control measures.
Because we can't deal with these viruses, there may be new genes that cause outbreaks.
The world is circulating a wide range of zoonic coronaviruses.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonic potential are extremely diverse.
There is a vast array of possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonic coronaviruses, which in the future will result in new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and (or) more fatal to humans.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, a culture of dietary use of wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned.
After severe tests of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 steels, a better preparedness and a plan to respond to such situations is needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be seized.
While many of the properties of bats are good for the spread of viruses, it is possible to minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wild animals.
For a better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, there is a need for constant epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing the transfer of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent a virus is to keep people away from the ecological layers of the natural reservoirs of zoonic viruses.
SARS-COV-2 is still missing some fragments.
First, if the bats have passed the ancestors of the SARS-Cov-2 virus to the pangolines, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transfer of humans, it is necessary to determine how humans have come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, can be receptive to SARS-Cov-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, a pangoline, or another mammal, it's expected that in the future, SARS-Cov-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified by their natural hosts.
Further studies in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-Cov-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for “suspected cases” and “confirmed cases” COVID-19 need to be updated.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a brief reference manual on the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCov), which provides an account of our experience and valid recommendations to combat the pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations, and we present the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspects of disease” and “confirmed cases” in line with the “Recommendations for Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19” (the seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), began to explode, and the virus itself was called the "heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-Cov-2 infection, our team developed a short reference manual and published it on the website of the magazine Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted a lot of attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven issues of the “Recommendations for Diagnostics and Treatment for COVID-19” published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have been issued, and some of its provisions have changed considerably.
Recently, the work of Zhou (Zhou) with the co-authors commented on our recommendations, which contained simple proposals for diagnostics based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on the global pandemic.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19 (probable seventh version) and on-going studies, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of the document (dated March 3, 2020), a single element of the epidemiological history must be combined with two clinical manifestations of the disease in order to provide a full analysis of the case of a suspected disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movements or stays in the city of Wuhan and its environs or in other localities where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in 14 days prior to the showing of symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acid); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and its environs or from other localities where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in the last 14 days prior to the display of symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases ( > 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms recorded in 2 weeks in small areas, such as a home or apartment, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external exposure to COVID-19; (3) the total number of white cells is normal or lowered, with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of the symptoms.
Diagnosis for a confirmed case should be based on the case of a suspected disease with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence: (1) real-time PCR tests are positive for SARS-Cov-2; (2) full-genomic sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity with respect to new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in the test result with a negative for SARS-Cov-2 antibodies of IgG, or an increase in the thyra at least four times in the recovery phase of the relevant acute phase.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) of the document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the airway or blood samples was added.
The pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions, and the seventh edition added the need for serologisch evidence.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an optimal set for the rapid diagnosis of nucleic acids, as well as for the analysis of samples from the respiratory tracts, including the collection of blood samples, which improves the availability of the different samples and contributes to the inclusion of the positive results of tests for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirmation of the disease.
However, there is growing evidence of the need for care in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients without express symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in the work of Zhou (Zhou) et al. should be updated, as it classifies persons with no clinical symptoms as a low-risk group.
The evaluation system also needs to be refined in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspects of disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations that are made in the countries in which they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the day maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in a day.
This is the largest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the reported cases included 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovering patients who had been home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In online surfing, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, Director of IEDCR, said that four men and one woman had been victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were aged over 60, two between the ages of 51 and 60, and one between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 Pandemic.
A member of the clinic informed the local news agency Anadole that Jalal Saifur Rahman, the Director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was one of the dead, who was being treated at the Maitri hospital in Kuwait.
On Saturday's online video, the Bangladesh Road and Bridge Minister Obaidul Quader stated that public transport would be suspended for a longer period than originally planned until the next Saturday.
Public transport was halted on 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods — medicine, fuel and food — was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March for two people who had returned from Italy, as well as for the wife of one of them.
As of 19 March, the three men had already recovered.
SARS-Cov-2 has crossed a millionth of the world's infections
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of coronavirus infections worldwide was over 1 million on Thursday.
The coronavirus COVID-19 killed at least 52,000 people.
The rubble occurred on the same day that Malawi had confirmed the first case of infection, and Zambia had recorded the first case of death by coronavirus.
North Korea claimed that it was one of the few countries with no coronavirus infection as of Thursday.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 in the 24 hours prior to 10:00 Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to Johns Hopkins University data, reported more than 1,000 deaths due to coronavirus infection in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced a tightening of measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobinin, extended the rule of self-insulation to 1 May.
Formerly, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians throughout the country, despite being self-sustaining, would receive wages until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of an extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of a vote was 215 in favour, 10 abstentions and one negative vote.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while the previous curfew lasted from only 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that the state's home-insulation regime had been extended by order until May 1.
Shops in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian Walworths and Coles stores have reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time in all stores in the country, to two and one package, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit.
These restrictions were reported in the cashier's ads, as well as on the Facebook page.
Citizens have reportedly started to make emergency stocks because of the fear that COVID-19 might lead to the introduction of a general self-insulation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the number of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Previously, on 4 and 5 March, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited the number to 4 packages.
The Colles Trade Network, in a press release dated 8 March, reported that, with the introduction of a four-pack limit, “many shops still buy toilet paper too fast, one delivery within an hour,” and called such a demand “unprecedential,” while the ALDI on Facebook post, published on Tuesday, called this trend “unexpected.”
According to Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited that number to two packages.
To make up for the shortfall, Coles began ordering larger shipments from suppliers and increasing the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made reserves for a special stock of early sales on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Ritters Association, reported that the Ritters are trying to replenish the stock, but this is made more difficult by the local authorities' restrictions on the travel schedule for trucks.
It is looking forward to a higher cost of products, as suppliers are trying to meet demand, but less and less favourable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, due to stock depletion, some shops were unable to hold shares on Wednesdays.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer at the University of Technology of Queensland, said that the stores were restocking the stores every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky product, so the stock stock was small, and after the sale of the whole product, long rows of shelves remained empty, exacerbating the lack of stock.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, the buyers would probably not panic so much,” says Russell Zimmerman.
In the last Wednesday, the producer of the reprocessed toilet paper, Who Geves a Crap, reported the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a toilet paper company, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent brands, reported that they work 24 hours a day to provide sufficient quantities of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne fell due to the absence of buyers during the week of Labour Day, some real estate vendors started offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The Thursday issue of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included a tab of eight pages to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, shops first reluctantly imposed restrictions on the number of items to be purchased, claiming that they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, galantery, hand-washing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening, it was observed that the online store of the British Supermarket Ocado also restricted the sale of toilet paper to Andres with two packages of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 Pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of COVID-19 infection caused by the Coronavirus SARS-Cov-2.
Although the term “pandemic” refers only to the extent of the disease, not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to take action:
“All countries together are still in a position to influence the evolution of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, insulate, monitor cases of disease, and mobilize their citizens,” the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tetros Adanom Gebreous, explained.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming rate of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in an interview on CNN in February that “no other respirator virus except the flu has yet to be tracked from the time it was created to the continued global spread.”
Mr. Gebreus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international importance and then gave it a new status, a pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauchie, said, "This is just the beginning, it's going to get worse."
According to Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The Coronavirus Pandemic 2019-2020 is the present-day Coronavirus Pandemie 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uhan, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020, an international public health emergency was declared, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic, on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respirator distress syndrome.
The time between the first symptom and the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
At present, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The basic treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and the preventive measures recommended include washing hands, covering mouths with cough, maintaining distances between people, detecting and ensuring self-insulation of people suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closure of various sites.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the transfer or abolition of sport, religious, political and cultural activities, and a widespread shortage of goods, exacerbated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting some 99.4 per cent of the world ' s students.
The Internet has begun to spread misinformation about the virus, there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asians, or people resembling them, as well as against other groups of people living in areas with significant incidences of the virus.
As a result of the reduction in travel and the closure of the heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have declined.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province of China, reported cases of pneumonia with unknown cause, and an investigation of the situation was launched in early January 2020.
Infectious cases were mostly linked to the Juanan seafood market, so the virus is believed to be of zoonic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-Cov-2. It is a recent open virus that has a large resemblance to the coronaviruses of the bat, the coronaviruses of the pangoline, and the SARS-CoV. Later it was found that the very first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019 and that the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, the South China branch of the Morning Post, which was unsubstantiated, suggested that the very first case of infection had occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the incidence of new infections in China had declined but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases can be significantly understated, in particular because of the number of cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, there had been relatively few cases of infection among young people, with patients under the age of 19 being less than 2.4 per cent worldwide, and the Chief Scientific Adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Wallans, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity was established.
Statistics include cases of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test was positive according to the official records.
As at 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, a formal policy had been adopted not to test for minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, by 23 January, 86 per cent of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China, and that such unregistered patients had become a source of infection for 79 per cent of the reported cases.
A statistical analysis, published on 30 March, showed that the number of actual cases in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infection (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this figure may be 5.7.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 are recovering well.
In other, more complex cases, the time between the beginning of the symptoms and the moment of death was between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent time being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths had been associated with COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of the deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age, while 75 per cent of the deaths were related to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account those who have not been tested, for example in the event of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID by 4 to 5 times.
The Spokesman of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: "We know that the [declared number of deaths] is lower than the actual number." His words are supported by reports of some isolated cases in the U.S., which are often incomplete in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 Swine Influenza epidemic. The first confirmed death was recorded in Uhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside Mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and, outside Asia, in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents, except Antarctica, had reported deaths, and several methods were usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary according to the region and the time of the spread of the disease; they are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time of the outbreak and the parameters of the population, such as age, gender and general health status.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97,039/1,617,204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality-to-pregnancy ratio fell from 17.3 per cent (on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (on 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of the percentage of disease-related deaths (CFR), the percentage of diagnosed patients who die of the disease and the percentage of infection-related deaths (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the figures of certain groups of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
The Oxford University Centre of Evidence estimates that the overall mortality rate from the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with the statistical study on the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO argues that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash cannot be determined and may vary from location to location.
Matei Boni, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, states that “uncontrollable communicable outbreaks tend to spread to the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers ends, they begin to fade.
In the present situation, however, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.”
Senior Medical Advisor to the Chinese Government, Jun Nanshan, states that “all things can be over by June” if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO's recommendations on measures to halt the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine announced that SARS-Cov-2 “will be circulating, perhaps within a year or two.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) is in place, it will be necessary to observe physical remoteness and other measures.
William Schaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, says, "I don't think that this coronavirus will ever go away forever, because it is so easily transmitted," and that it “can become a seasonal disease that explodes every year.
The volatility of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unspecified, and some infected people can bear the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are elevated temperature (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetness in the airway (silent), loss of smell, breath, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chill, vomiting, hemorrhaging, diarrhea or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms, such as respiratory problems, constant pains, or feelings of strangulation in the breast, sudden sense of mental confusion, difficulty in waking up and blue face or lips. If these symptoms are present, you need to immediately seek medical treatment. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and death.
For some infected people, the disease may run symptically, without any clinical effects, but the results of the tests confirm the infection, so the doctors recommend that those who are in close contact with confirmed patients should be placed under strict control and be screened for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate the number of cases of non-symptomatic currents ranged from a few to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. It is not clear as to the symptom of loss of smell: the initial estimate is that the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptom was 30 per cent, and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as by small droplets that are released to the air with a cough, sneeze, or during conversation; close contact means contact between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, the drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) at open cough.
It is assumed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops released into the air during conversations that can stay in the air for a longer time. Respirator drops can also be generated by exhalation, including during conversations, although the virus is not usually carried over the air.
The drops can be in the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as in the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (CLR), can lead to the dispersal of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches the polluted surface, including the skin, and then touches his or her eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of a fecal-oral transfer of SARS-CV-2. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the symptoms appear, although it can be spread either before the symptoms or at later stages of the disease.
There have been times when tests have been positive in testing three days before the symptoms, and this suggests that the virus can be transmitted before the symptoms are expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of non-symptomic current, but contact monitoring studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from non-symptomatic carriers.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that it is not clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects 2 to 3 others, and the virus can survive on surfaces from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304), the virus was able to live for up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day, and on the copper surface for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, and a positive result was obtained for domestic and other animals on COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans, although the British authorities suggest washing hands after contacting animals, just as they do after contacting other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Severe acute coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CV-2) is a new virus found for the first time in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the nature of congenital coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by means of domestic soap, which dissolves its protective shell.
It is assumed to be of zoonic origin.
A genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with a species of Betacoravirus, suburb of Sarbecovrus (cell line B) in conjunction with two other strains of bat viruses.
It is 96% identical to the other model of the coronavirus of the bat (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome of pangoline viruses and human viruses.
An integer-genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92%) is between the pangolin coronavirus and the SARS-Cov-2, but it is not enough to prove that the pangolines are the intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it should eventually be confirmed by polymeraceous chain reactions with back-translation (RT-PRR) of an infected secret or computer tomography.
A study comparing the methods of the PCR and the CT used in Uhan showed that the CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions are consistent with other pneumonia and current disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has issued a recommendation that “no CT be used to screen or test the first line for COVID-19.
WHO published several RNA test protocols on SARS-Cov-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-CPR) is tested.
It can be performed on breathing and blood samples.
The results are usually available for a period of between hours and days.
A swab is usually used to perform the test, although a swab can also be used, and a number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently accurate to be approved for universal application.
In the U.S., the Celex serology test was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Asymmetric peripheral disturbances of the type of matt glass and the absence of pleural effluents are some of the characteristics of the visualization of symptoms in X-rays and CTs.
The Italian Radiological Society is in the process of constructing an international database of confirmed cases of contamination.
Due to similarities with other infections, such as adenovirus, in the identification of COVID-19, images not supported by PCR tests have a limited clinical specificity.
In China, a major study was carried out comparing the results of breast CT and PCR testing, and it was found that, while the images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be deciphered more quickly; they are also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be seen as a tool for screening in the contaminated areas.
In order to diagnose the virus with X-rays and CT scans, CTNs have been developed on the basis of artificial intelligence.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintenance of general personal hygiene, washing of hands, avoiding contact with the eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, use in coughing or sneezing of napkins, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may have already been infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that physical distance from people should be maintained, and many Governments recommend that no time-bound visits to countries and areas affected by the outbreak should be prevented and that the movement of citizens should be restricted.
Nevertheless, the virus has spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread to a population whose members do not know where or how they have been infected. Health professionals who care for patients who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with others and eye protection.
The use by Governments of data on the location of citizens by means of their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (Amnesty International), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring that this kind of surveillance be limited.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on the development of solutions to ensure the privacy of personal data, such as recording the user's proximity to other mobile phones via Bluetooth.
If a mobile phone user was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he is notified. There is also a baseless version of how to prevent infection, such as a nose-and-mouth strip, which is actually inefficient.
So far, there is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on it.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends that hands with soap and water should be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or severe hand contamination, as well as before food, after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens up its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of disinfectant hands on a alcohol-based basis of at least 60 per cent.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated by a number of solutions (on the stainless steel surface, the disinfectant begins to function a minute after application) with a content of 62 to 71 per cent ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent isopropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent iodine.
Other components, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of a suspicion of or confirmation of COVID in an institution, such as an office or a day-to-day facility, all the spaces of such a space, including rooms, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment, such as tablets, sensor screens, keyboards, remote control and aTMs used by sick persons, be disinfected.
Health-care organizations recommend that the mouth and nose of the elbow or napkin be covered with a cough or sneeze, and that the used hygiene items be discarded immediately.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to use medical masks, as the use of the mask may limit the volume and range of breath products that dissipate in the air when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and touching the face with their dirty hands is the main way of infection.” The masks are also recommended for the use of those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of a mask does reduce the number of touches on the person.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC Centers in the United States recommend wearing non-medical tissue face masks. China has singled out the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with other people (1 meters (3 feet) or less.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or public places.
Health officials in Thailand have encouraged people to make face masks in the home and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are not allowed to go out without masks covering their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Vietnamese Government requested all citizens to wear masks in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government has ordered all visitors to the grocery store to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks were produced per day since mid-March, all passengers on trains and coaches were ordered to use medical masks.
In Panama, people are obliged to wear a medical mask when they go out; those who cannot buy masks are advised to sew them themselves in the home.
Medical masks are also widely used by the people of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social remoteness (also known as physical distance) is a control measure to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Safeguards include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closures, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social remoteness measures to stay at home, limit travel, avoid crowded places, use uncontacted greetings and physically distance themselves from others.
Many governments in the regions, particularly those affected by the outbreak, are currently ordering or recommending social distances.
The maximum number of people who can meet in one place, as recommended by U.S. government and health-care agencies, has been rapidly reduced from 250 (in regions where data on the proliferation of COVID-19 was not available) to 50, and later to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people, and the elderly and those suffering from diseases such as diabetes, cardiac diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of contracting the virus in a serious way. CDC recommends that they stay home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. In late March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the term “social distancation” with “physical distancing”, thus clarifying the aim of this measure to reduce physical contact in social relations, whether by virtue of virtual communication or by observing physical distance.
The use of the term “social remoteness” was understood to mean that people should be subjected to complete social exclusion instead of remaining in contact with others in alternative ways, and some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it was recommended that you only have sex with your permanent partners with whom you live, and in whom you are sure it has no virus and no symptoms.
Those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect that they are infected are recommended for self-insulation in the home.
Health-care agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-insulation, and many Governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas be placed in self-imposed quarantine.
Those in high-risk groups were ordered the strictest quarantine.
Those who may have been in contact with COVID-19, or have recently visited a country or region significantly affected by the epidemic, were encouraged to be in quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat the outbreak include controlling, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and is intended to track and isolate the infected, as well as other measures of infectious control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are being made to mitigate the impact: measures are being taken to slow the spread of the disease and to mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
Controlling the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the equalization of the epidemic.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and allow more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures, such as hand-hygiene, use of medical masks and self-insulation; social measures aimed at physical remoteness, such as the closing of schools and the cancellation of mass events; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and measures to protect the environment, such as surface cleaning; and, once the severity of the outbreak became apparent in China, more resolute action was taken to contain the outbreak, such as the isolation of entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as a system for alerting the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected people who were self-insulated and had imposed heavy fines on those who had not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has been increased and the accumulation of excess medical supplies has been fined, and the British-US model has shown that there are major challenges to mitigation (delaying but not halting the spread of the epidemic) and to suppressing (stopping the epidemic).
Optimal policies to reduce the impact of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3, and mortality by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Substance may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or as long as the vaccine is not developed, if sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has led to social and economic costs.
There are currently no anti-virus drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are under way to develop them, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking non-receptive medicaments against cold, drinking enough liquid, and rest can help to alleviate the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid infusion, and respiration support.
The use of steroid drugs can only cause harm.
Several compounds that had been previously approved for the treatment of other virus diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “conventional and home-based means” can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-Cov-19.
WHO views health capacity-building and adapting to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the main response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for primary health-care clinics and services to assist in the reallocation of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the elimination of non-immediate procedures, where possible, for the detection of the virus and the isolation of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as the expansion of intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the availability of HVF and beds.
There are different theories about where the very first case of infection may have occurred, the so-called “zero patient.”
The first known case of new coronavirus infection probably occurred on 1 December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China.
The number of cases of coronavirus infection in the province of Hubei has gradually increased over a month.
They were mainly linked to the Juanan seafood wholesale market, where live animals were also sold, and one of the theories is that the virus was infiltrated by one of these animals; in other words, the virus is of zoonous origin. On 26 December, a case of mass pneumonia of unknown origin was reported at the Hubei County Hospital, with which the doctor Zhang Tianjin was working, who reported the case to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Wuhan on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the central hospital in Wuhan warned their colleagues about a “coronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlyan, had been warned by the police of their responsibility for spreading false rumours, and the doctor, I-Fen, had been reprimanded by his superiors for raising alarm.
Later, on 31 December, the Uhan City Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
The Uhan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was high enough to initiate an investigation in early January, and the number of cases doubled at the early stages of the outbreak approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, thanks to Chinese New Year's Days and the fact that Wuhan is the transport and main rail hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had been diagnosed with the disease; as of 26 March, the United States had outpaced China and Italy for the largest number of confirmed infections in the world; as of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 had died, and more than 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen zone have restricted their free movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to control the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory stay at home, compulsory shelter or isolation), and curfews. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in some form of quarantine, over 50 million were in isolation from the Philippines, about 59 million were in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later the figure rose to 2.6 billion, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Uhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, whose credibility was not verified, the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Zhang Jisian's doctor was working on a case of an unknown type of pneumonia, which was reported by her clinic on 27 December to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Wuhan.
The initial genetic test of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, revealed the existence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uhan issued a public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In response to such notifications, the police alerted the doctors in Ouhan to the responsibility for “distribution of rumours” of the outbreak.
Initially, the National Health Commission of China claimed that there was no “substantial evidence” of the ability of a newly discovered virus to transfer from man to man.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, later called China Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping "the People's War."
Events of “the largest quarantine in the history of mankind” began to unfold, on 23 January the health border and the ban on entry to and from Wuhan was announced, and later extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
In the city, the use of private transport was banned.
In many places, the celebrations of China's New Year (25 January) have been cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, the Léšenian, was built, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also reassigned 14 other institutions in Ouhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travelers and the extension of the period of celebration of the Chinese New Year.
Universities and schools have been closed all over the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In a number of regions of China, the authorities have put in place a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in the province of Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been rescheduled, and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, it was estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) had been subjected to some form of outdoor restrictions, and since the outbreak had entered the global phase in March, China’s authorities had taken strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing had introduced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city, and as of 23 March, only one case of internal transmission had been recorded in mainland China, which had occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, China's Prime Minister, Li Keqiang, reported that the spread of intra-country cases had been largely halted, and the outbreak in China had been controlled.
On the same day, travel restrictions to Hubei, apart from Uhan, were lifted, which occurred two months after the closure of the province to the quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that entry for persons holding a visa or residence permit would be suspended as of 28 March.
Those who want to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on the enterprises and factories to resume work and provided the companies with monetary stimulus packages. On 4 April, at 10 a.m., a national “minute of silence” was held, opening a day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus, declared by the State Council of the country and coincided with the Quinmin festival, but the central government requested citizens to pay tribute to the dead online, observing physical distances to avoid a relapse of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely because a large number of followers of the new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji, had gathered in Tegu.
Shincheonji's followers came to Tegu from Uhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9,336 members of the Church, 1,261 (about 13 per cent) reported having symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea announced the highest level of alarm.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were recorded in Korea, and as of 29 February, the figure had risen to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers had been diagnosed with a virus.
The outbreak has affected the number of flights, so the flight schedule of the airlines has been changed, and South Korea has launched a programme to screen the population for the presence of the virus, to monitor contact and to organize quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered to be the largest and best organization in the world.
Screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms via a mobile application to all those who had come from abroad, a criminal test for the virus, the results of which had been ready the following day, and an increase in testing capabilities, which allowed for the daily testing of up to 20,000 people.
South Korea’s programme is considered to be a success in the fight against the outbreak of disease, despite the fact that entire cities have not been isolated, and South Korea’s society has initially split up because of President Mun Jae In’s reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for the Government's inadequate response to the outbreak.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had recorded the lowest total number of cases per day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed in a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on 1 April, in South Korea, 121 countries requested help testing for the virus.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-Cov-2 infection in Kum, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Health Education, two people died later the same day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closing of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to subject entire areas affected by the outbreak to quarantine, but that only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
In March, plans to limit intercity travel were announced, but the intensive movement between the cities before the Persian New Year continued.
The Shia shrines in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020, and Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the background of allegations of concealment of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February more than 10 countries had linked their cases to Iran, which indicates that the incidence of the outbreak may be more serious than the 388 cases recorded by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was shut down, and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on 3 March, had a positive test result for the virus.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called upon the Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to release temporarily all prisoners eligible for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate health care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By March 23, Iran recorded 50 new cases of coronavirus every hour and one new death every 10 minutes from the coronavirus.
According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran can affect the country’s financial ability to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had called for the relaxation of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had spread to Italy, when two Chinese tourists had a positive impact on the SARS-Cov-2 tests in Rome.
The number of cases of infection has increased rapidly, prompting the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 of the 11 different municipalities in northern Italy had been placed in quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "The entry into and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as there had already been 100 deaths in Italy.
All major sporting events, including the A series, were scheduled to take place in private until April, but all sporting events were postponed for at least one month on 9 March.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conté ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analysis, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIARTI) issued recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for the prioritization of medical care that may need to be used.
On March 19, Italy overcame China's death rate by coronavirus, ranked first in the world, after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military jets with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of them concentrated in the Lombardia region.
One CNN report notes that this high death rate in Italy can be facilitated by a combination of two factors: a large number of older citizens in Italy and a lack of capacity to screen all who are currently suffering from coronavirus.
The United Kingdom had responded to the virus most calmly in all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020 the British Government had not obliged citizens to observe any form of social remoteness or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not responding quickly and seriously to the danger facing the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement in which he recommended that all travel and social contacts, of no priority, should be avoided, inviting people to work from home as far as possible and to avoid public spaces, such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised the working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than £2500 a month, as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter measures for social distancing, prohibiting more than two persons from meeting, and limiting travel and active rest in the outdoors to cases of extreme need.
In contrast to previous measures, these restrictions have been imposed through the use of the police, the imposition of fines and the dismantling of crowds.
Most of the enterprises have been ordered to close, with the exception of those that provide “life for the population”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business stores, gas stations and garages.
On January 20, in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington, D.C., a man who had returned from Wuhan on January 15 was confirmed as the country's first case of COVID-19.
On 29 January, a Task Force on the Control of Coronavirus was established in the White House.
On 31 January, the Trump administration declared a state of emergency in the public health sector and imposed entry restrictions on people coming from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading U.S. government public health organization, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite this, the United States population was not tested immediately, and as a result, the true level of the outbreak was concealed during that period.
Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the federal Government in February, the absence of federal permission by the end of February for the use of non-State test kits developed by academic organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as by restrictive criteria before the beginning of March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done for the appointment of a doctor).
The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been carried out in the United States by 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that by March 13, less than 14,000 tests had been carried out.
On March 22, Associated Press reported: “Many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor's appointment, were waiting for their turn to be tested for hours or days.” On February 29, the first case of death by coronavirus in the United States was reported by the Governor, J Insley, to be declared a state of emergency, which was also announced by other states.
On March 3, Seattle Schools were cancelled, and by mid-March, schools had closed all over the country. On March 6, 2020, a group of epidemiologists from the Imperial College, London, informed the United States of the forecasts of the impact of the new Coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Act on Additional Allocations for Preparedness and Response to the Coronavirus, which provided the federal authorities with emergency assistance of US$ 8.3 billion to respond to the outbreak of the disease.
Corporations imposed travel restrictions on staff members, cancelled conferences and encouraged staff to work from home.
The sporting events and seasons were cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions to most of Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom, for 30 days, starting March 13.
The next day, he extended the limits to include Britain and Ireland.
On 13 March, the President declared a state of emergency in the country, which enabled the use of federal funds to deal with the crisis.
Since March 15, many companies have started to shut down or shorten their working hours throughout the United States, helping to combat the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the district of Columbia. On 23 March, it was reported that there had been 10,700 cases in New York in a 24-hour period, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the Governor said that social distancing was likely to be an effective measure, as the rate of double the number of cases fell from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As at 28 March, 32,308 cases had been recorded in New York and 672 had died, and it was reported that on 26 March, there had been more confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy, and as at 8 April, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States of America, while 12,841 had died.
According to media reports of 30 March, President Trump decided to extend the period of social distancing until 30 April.
On the same day, the USNS Comfort hospital ship was fixed at the port of New York for 1,000 beds.
On April 3, 884 deaths from coronavirus were recorded in the United States within 24 hours.
In the state of New York, on 3 April, the number of cases was over 100,000, and the White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring information being made available to the public through the office of Vice-President Mike Pence, which monitors public statements and the publication of the virus by health officials and scientists.
In general, the views of the supporters of President Trump on how successful he is in dealing with the crisis have been divided.
Some officials and commentators have criticized the US’s dependence on the import of essential materials, including essentials, from China.
In mid-January 2020, the Travel Medicine magazine published an analysis of air travel patterns, which was used to map and predict the spread of the disease.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of travelers from Uhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes in Bali, the worst-prepared Australian cities are considered to be the most well-prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted a new coronavirus (COVID-19) emergency plan.
In this regard, it is stated that much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will pay special attention to border control and communications in a threat situation.
On 21 March, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.
Thanks to effective quarantine measures in the public transport sector in Uhan and Hubei, some countries had planned to evacuate their nationals and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights by their home countries, to which the Chinese authorities had granted permission.

Japan had also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey had sent medical equipment, Russia over 13 tons of medicines, Malaysia had announced a donation of 18 million medical gloves, Germany had sent a variety of medical supplies, including 10,000 protective kits, the United States had donated 17.8 tons of medicines, and had pledged $100 million in financial support to the affected countries, and after the situation in China had stabilized, the country had also sent assistance to other countries affected by the pandemic.
In March, China, Cuba, and Russia sent drugs and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to be distributed to the organization by its States Parties.
Later, he also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks, and 5 IVL machines to Panama.
The Czech Republic, Georgia, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey also donated drugs to Canada, and expressed concern about medical masks and test kits for Chinese production.
For example, Spain had withdrawn 58,000 Chinese Coronavirus test kits, which provided only 30 per cent accuracy, and the Netherlands had withdrawn 600,000 missing Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also removed 100,000 unusable medical masks: they were supposed to have been manufactured in China, but later found to have come from Colombia.
On the other hand, China ' s aid was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency relief operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.
WHO noted that there was a clear difference between the wake-up of atypical pneumonia in 2002-2004, in which the Chinese authorities had been accused of seizing information, which allegedly prevented the prevention and control of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central Government “regulously provided updated information on the situation in order to avoid panic on the eve of China's New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban transport in Uhan, the WHO representative, Goden Galea, noted that, while “this measure was certainly not recommended by WHO,” it was also a “very important confirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the most common place” and called it “unprecedent in public health history”. On 30 January, after the confirmation of the ability to transfer infection from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of people infected in other countries, WHO declared an international public health emergency (PHEIC), a situation that had been the sixth since 2009 when the measure was first introduced in the context of a swine flu pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tetros Adanom, said that the announcement of PHEIC was due to “the high global spread, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that do not have sound health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros said that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to provide $675 million in strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need for urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “an indicator of our readiness is the level of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest” and called on the international community to “make a choice whether to invest today or to pay for the future.” At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, he said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide a “potential of the whole UN system in response to the problem”.
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Team has been set up to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO states, will “concentrate on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to deal with a wider social and economic outbreak”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc group, which provided international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in the internal management of the situation and to assess the “seriousness of the disease and its contagion”, organized seminars and meetings with key national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of the response at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that “it is too early to call the disease a pandemic, but countries must nevertheless be ready to do so”.
When the outbreak erupted in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the probability of global coronavirus spreading would be increased from “high” to “very high” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, warned in his statement: “It is a test of every government on the planet's readiness to be on the ground: it is time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared,” and stressed that the right response can help the world to avoid a “worst scenario of events.”
Ryan also stated that current data did not justify the declaration of the global pandemic by public health officials, and added that the declaration of the pandemic would mean that “we are in fact recognizing the fact that everyone on the planet will be at risk of contracting the virus.”
On March 11, WHO declared the outbreak of the coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO said that WHO was “deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high incidence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on the problem.” WHO is seriously criticized for the perceived inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the current situation, Mr. Tetros Adanom, Director-General of WHO, was requested to resign, which was signed by 733,000 as at 6 April.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to take life-saving measures against him, and the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone had the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in very poor conditions, prisoners, and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as feedback and advice.
The digital hub contains information on the policy measures of different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese Government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonro, son of the President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonro, for the actions taken to combat the pandemic, which began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the level of the provinces had been dismissed for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and the dismissals had shown dissatisfaction with the political response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect China’s Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the outbreak of the coronavirus had begun in Uhan, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had occurred in the US or Italy.
The U.S. president's administration, Donald Trump, called the Coronavirus the “China virus” or the “Uhan virus”, stating that “censorship in China is only exacerbating the situation with the virus, which has now become a global pandemic,” and this statement was in turn criticized by some commentators, who claim that such an approach is racist and “distracts from the failure of the U.S. president's administration to control the spread of the disease.”
The Daily Beast had access to a U.S. government telegram, which contained a communications strategic trick, apparently invented by the National Security Council, with the following references to the strategy: "It's all in China.
We are being asked to distribute this information in any way possible, including press conferences and TV shows. "Associations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to help countries affected by the virus are part of the “propaganda drive” to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitic component that includes the struggle for influence through the PR and the so-called policy of generosity.”
Borrell also stated that “China is persevering in its role as a responsible and reliable partner, as opposed to the US.”
China also called on the US to lift the sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and according to some accounts, by sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned in connection with the US sanctions imposed on April 3.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of redirecting aid intended for other countries to their own country.
Other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy, have also had disputes with regard to medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has allocated hundreds of SVLs to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of support for the coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, the Italian Ambassador to the EU, said that “China was the only one that responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, following a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conté of Italy, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the transport to Italy of Russian military paramedics, specialized disinfectant transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source” claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “unhelpful or of little use to Italy.
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on the global public at the “geopolitic and diplomatic” level.
President Attillo Fontana of Lombardia and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected the media attacks and expressed their gratitude for the assistance.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The Spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, stated that “in offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the rate of production, they will also be able to respond if necessary.”
The NATO Defence 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted in a shortened format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 (Protector 2020) exercise: “In the current public health crisis, the conduct of these exercises threatens not only the lives of the US military and many European member countries, but also the people of the countries in which such activities are to take place.” Iran’s Government has been severely affected by the virus, and about two dozen members of Parliament, as well as 15 other current or former politicians, have been infected.
On March 14, 2020, Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, in an open letter, asked world leaders for help, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in fighting the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to the US sanctions against Iran, and the epidemic had led to calls for the United States to adopt social policies that had been spread in other rich countries, including the introduction of a unified system of health care and care, paid family leave and increased public health financing.
Politologists expected that this might have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, and the pandemic had made the diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worse.
South Korea criticized Japan's “undefined and passive Quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any South Korean citizen would be placed in a two-week quarantine in government-specific locations.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Mun Jae-jin's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans had signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for the Government's perceived inadequate response to the outbreak of the disease, and the pandemic had led countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Victor Orban the permanent right to rule by decree, to suspend the work of Parliament, and to hold elections and to punish those who would be accused of disseminating false information about the virus and on the government response to the crisis.
The outbreak of the coronavirus was cited as the cause of a number of supply shortfalls due to the global increase in the use of anti-epidetic equipment, the acquisition of goods in a state of panic and the disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings of a shortage of drugs and medical equipment, due to increased consumer demand and failure in the performance of suppliers.
There had also been panic shopping in a number of localities, which had led to the loss of basic supplies, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which in turn had led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tetros Adanom, the demand for personal protection has grown 100fold.
This leap has led to a 20-fold increase in prices over the normal price, as well as a four to six-month delay in the delivery of medical supplies.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection tools around the world, and WHO warned that health-care workers would be at risk for that reason.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, Daigo buyers have been given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities have led to a lack of infant food in some supermarkets and have subsequently been banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in North Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, acute food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation and illegal trade of critically important products, which had been successful, had prevented the acute food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
North Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but the industry believes that agricultural prices can rise.
The food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork to ensure that the population was well fed.
Similar laws require food producers to conserve food supplies in the event of an emergency are in place in Italy.
The damage to the world economy had affected China: according to the media of 16 March, China’s economy had been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to combat the spread of the virus, which had led to a 20.5 per cent drop in retail sales.
Mainland China is a major economic and production centre; it is therefore believed that the viral outburst is a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agatha Demari, a member of the Economics Union, predicted that market volatility would continue until the potential results became more clear.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could outperform the effects of the 2002-2004 SAR epidemic.
One of the estimates made by an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis is that the damage to the world supply chain can exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact can last for up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take “emergency measures” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to a fall in demand from China.
On February 24, world stock markets collapsed because of a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside Mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indexes, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and Dow Johns for industrial shares, have shown the sharpest drop since 2008, with the Dow index down by 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indexes showed a more than 10 per cent drop.
On February 28, Scape Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The stock fell again due to fear of the spread of the coronavirus, and the largest collapse occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.
The economist Mohamed El Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks react faster than in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in relation to travel bans, the closure of public spaces, including tourist attractions, and the recommendation of Governments not to make any travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to a sharp drop in the demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional Flybe airline has ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been as strong as ever.
Several rail stations and ports have also been closed down.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of China's New Year's celebrations.
A number of events involving a large number of people, including the annual New Year's festivals, have been cancelled by national and regional governments, and private companies have themselves closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.
Many New Year's events had been cancelled, and tourist attractions had been closed to prevent mass crowds; for example, Beijing had closed the Holy City and abolished the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and districts of China, the authorities extended the New Year's Vacation until 10 February, instructing most enterprises not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year's celebrations, and the retail sector has suffered worldwide: shop hours have been shortened, and some shops have been temporarily closed.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America fell by 40 per cent.
Sales in North America and the Middle East cut sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March, the attendance of shopping centres fell by 33-43 per cent compared to February.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that a recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic may leave between 14 and 22 million more people out of poverty than it would have in a similar situation but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Ouhan, some 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers found themselves at home in the provinces of their country or in the province of Hubei, and in March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought the help of the Government.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the outbreak of coronavirus can rob 47 million people of jobs and the unemployment rate can reach 32 per cent. Self-sustainability measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers who receive daily pay out of work. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44 per cent of Canadian households have in one way or another experienced unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment benefit, while 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit, and nearly half a million companies in Germany moved their employees to a government-subsidized short-term work schedule — part-time.
The German part-time pay scheme was also introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations, as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Culture and art organizations have tried to support their (often State-funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for the community, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, as well as, if possible, supporting the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been shut down for an indefinite period, or had been restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances had been cancelled or rescheduled.
In return, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, another recent and growing effect of the spread of the virus, such as the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a setback, and the Vatican announced the annulment of the Good Week events in Rome, which are being held in the last week of the Christian penitential period, the Great Post.
Many dioceses advise older Christians to stay at home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services have begun to broadcast on radio, live or on television, while some church leaders have offered to perform public service.
The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome shut down its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims are no longer present, and later other religious organizations have also abolished worship and restricted access to public worship in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gourrows.
The Ministry of Health of Iran had announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the Coronavirus, and the shrines had later been closed; Saudi Arabia had barred foreign pilgrims and its own residents from entering the Holy Places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since the Second World War.
Most of the major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA League of Champions 2019-20, the Premier League 2019-20, the Euro-2020 UEFA, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The outbreak of the coronavirus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “post-2020, but no later than the summer of 2021.” The casino and other games around the world had been closed down, and the poker tournaments, which were usually broadcast live, had either been rescheduled or cancelled.
This has led many players to go online, and many gaming sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for the continuation of their activities and the sharing of their results on the Internet, direct online concerts or web festivals, helping people in creative professions to continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
There's a lot of Internet memoirs on the subject of the coronavirus online, many of which are humorous and soothe the anxiety of the periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against Chinese and East Asian citizens, as well as against the people of hot spots in Europe, the US and other countries.
There have been instances of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
The February information sheets (when most cases of infection were still limited to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who had allegedly earned the virus or had received fair retribution for anything.
In some African countries, anti-Chinese sentiments are also on the rise.
Many residents of Ouhan and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China's citizens, as well as those living in virus-affected areas, have received support both offline and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this context, citizens of such regions may also begin to feel the impact of suspicion and xenophobia, and citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed an early petition, insisting that Chinese citizens should not enter their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComToJapan (#Chinese Don't Come to Japan) was in the lead on Twitter.
Chinese, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report a growing level of racist sentiments and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus “the Chinese virus; critics consider this to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Uhan to the New Sanjara.
Students coming from North-East India bordering China and studying in the major cities of India reported cases of persecution related to a coronavirus outbreak.
Dileep Ghosh, president of the State unit of the party of Bharatiya Janath, Western Bengal, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “so God had avenged them.”
Later, these remarks were condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, who called them “disgusting.” In China, the pandemic rekindled xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese citizens: foreigners became called “foreign trash” and “recycling” objects.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many academic publishers have made public their scientific articles on the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their studies on the printers' publications servers, such as biRxiv.
Prevalent infectious disease — an infectious disease from a returning pathogen, the range of which is often unknown

List of epidemics and pandemics - List of deaths due to infectious disease
The smuggling of wild animals and diseases from animals to humans is a health risk associated with the trade in exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-Cov-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the OTCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only RNAs of the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
It is used to confirm relatively recent or active infections.
Antibodies (serology) can be detected for both diagnosis and population control.
Tests on antibodies reveal the number of people who have suffered from the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated in the hospital or not at all.
The exact rate of death due to this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests carried out in different countries was very conflicting.
Such data differences are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality, which in some countries may be significantly overstated.
Using a polymeraceous chain reaction to real-time real-time back-translation (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on samples from the respiratory paths obtained in a variety of ways, including swab swab or sample of the wet.
The results are usually available for a period of between a few hours and two days.
The OT-PCR test carried out on swabs taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, but it can continue to reproduce in the lungs.
Infected patients tested in the second week of the disease may alternatively take material from the lower airway by sucking catheter, or use refreshments (nail).
An early test of the PCR was developed at the Sharita Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymeraceous real-time rendition chain (rRT-PCR) and was the basis for 250,000 sets, which were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a kit to detect SARS-Cov-2 based on the PCR at the clinical level (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It detects the "E" gene common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the "RdRp" gene specific to SARS-Cov-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to have been authorized by the National Drug Administration of China to use the SARS-Cov-2 detection kit on the basis of the PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute, through the organization International Regent Resource, their real-time diagnostic panel for RT-PR (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test sets produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow area of testing conducted by CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using the two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
Testing was approved by the Food and Drug Watch as part of an emergency application permit, and US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that it was possible to test COVID-19 on the basis of the RT-PRCs all over the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing on COVID-19 throughout the country on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limits have been declared; the abstraction and processing of the tests should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Centre for Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Public Health Watch, and it was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA to use a test that can be performed within 3.5 hours on a large number of samples, allowing one machine to process some 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application permit (EUA) to Abbott Labs to test the Abbott M2000 system; earlier the FDA issued a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fischer Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives the EUA from the FDA for a test of about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses amplification of insulated nucleic acids instead of the PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can produce positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott is planning to increase production to 50,000 tests per day, and Taiwan is currently developing a monoclonial antibody test that is linked to the nucleocapsid protein (N-squirrel) of the new coronavirus, and it is hoped that it will be possible to produce the results in 15 to 20 minutes, like the flu express test.
A March 2020 study of specialized literature concluded that “borrow rentgenograms have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while the results of the CT [computer tomography] can be of such value even before symptoms occur”.
Typical features identified during the CT include bilateral multi-pillar sub-plural seals of the "matter glass" type, with peripheral, asymmetrical and a posterior distribution.
Sub-plural domination, the symptom of the rocky bridge, and the consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Uhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that the CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, though less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has issued a recommendation that “no CT be used to screen or test the first line in COVID-19.” As of March 2020, the initial CDC screening is recommended to use the PCR method.
Part of the immune response to infection is to produce antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to carry out population control. The tests can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by in situ diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-productive automated systems, but their availability will depend on the rate of production of each system.
A single peripheral blood sample is usually used in CLT, although a series sample can be used to track the immune response.
At the PoCT, one blood sample is usually produced by piercing each cover.
In contrast to PCR methods, the stage of blood collection is not required to take a sample. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their tests to antibodies.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA had approved only one emergency application test. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagostics and Epitope Diagnostics had been granted European permission to use their test sets, which can detect antibodies in IgG and IgA blood samples that can control the virus.
The test output is several hundred samples for several hours, and therefore the method works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of the viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection, and in early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibodies test kits it had acquired produced satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients suspected of staying at home: “Emergency staff are handing over a sample sample tube to the patient,” the patient spits it out, and after a while gets the results of the test. The British NHS has announced the launch of a pilot scheme to test suspicious cases in the home, which removes the risk of infection by the patient of other clients in the clinic, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it is used to transport the patient.
Express testing centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive test procedures in any country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors stated that they were ready to run about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient conditions, and a week earlier they could do only 10,700 tests a week.
If the examination is appointed by a doctor, the cost is covered by the health insurance.
According to the president of the Institute, Robert Koch, the total productivity of Germany in testing is 160,000 tests a week.
As at 19 March, it had been proposed to conduct a rapid test in a number of major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
As of calendar week 12/220, a total of at least 483,295 tests were taken on SARS-Cov-2, up to and including the week of 12/220, and 33,491 (6.9 per cent) were positive. Researchers at the Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample shows a positive result. In Uhan on 5 February 2020, BGI opened an interim laboratory of 2,000 square meters to detect an emergency called "Huo-Yang" (in Chinese or "Fire Eye"), which can handle more than 10,000 samples a day.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by the BGI founder Van Jiang and completed in just five days; the simulation showed that if the laboratory had not been put into service at this fast pace, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher, and therefore the cost of the quarantine would also have been twice as high.
At the opening of the lab in Uhan, the Huo-Yang laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened in a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day, and open multiplex Origami Assays were released, which can test up to 1,122 tests of patients on COVID19 using only 93 tests. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, excluding the use of robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to a shortage of reagents, mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom, and the United States had become a problem.
As a result, some authors have referred to test-testing protocols, which provide for the heating of the samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the volume of testing for the coronavirus currently being conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita was higher than that of any other country, and that a large proportion of the population would soon be tested.
This was the result of rapid testing, along with the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (built by their Huo-Yang emergency detection labs in China).
This lab, which has been deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PRC tests a day, and is the world's first such large-scale laboratory operating outside China.
Various testing options for different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of the test kit, which is sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own sets.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States health and epidemiology centres was not available until 28 January, which led to the absence of test kits in the United States. At the start of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits, and those countries, as well as Australia, had not been able to provide sufficient sets recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts say that the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the scaling up of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many of the United States private labs, which received hundreds of thousands of test samples, were overloaded, and stocks of swab and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test sets.
The U.S. CDC test sets had “deficiencies” and the government had therefore removed the bureaucracy that prevented the private development of the tests, and Spain had purchased the test sets from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co. Ltd, but found that the results of the tests had not been accurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the inaccuracy of the results might be the failure to collect the samples or the misuse of the sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the incorrect sets and replace them with other sets, the Shenzhen Bioeasy sets. 80 per cent of the test sets that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had yielded incorrect results. The 1.2 million test sets that Slovakia had acquired in China had also been found to be incorrect.
Atesh Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had “high levels of error” and the Ministry “went to use them.” The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was declared unfit for use.
Quarantine measures for those whose tests had had a positive impact on SARS-Cov-2, as well as the monitoring of the people with whom such patients had been in contact, had had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where the first person in Italy died of COVID-19, conducted two test cycles for the total population of about 3,400 at a interval of about 10 days.
About half of the people with a positive result had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases had been placed in quarantine.
The entry to the locality had been closed, and the measure had completely halted the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive surveillance of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 Coronaviris Pandemic in Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries, and extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and shops had not been imposed.
Many of the events there had been cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore had begun to urge residents to stay at home, but schools that had ended on 23 March had opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also coped with the pandemic through intensive contact monitoring, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions have been less aggressive.
A statistical study showed that in countries where more tests had been carried out than the number of deaths, the mortality rate was much lower, probably because those countries had been able to detect more patients with low or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative test results to COVID-19 in one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for validation testing.
Of these 16 control laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the next graph, the column “good results” depends on a country-specific test policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized patients will have a higher rate of success than a country that testes all citizens, irrespective of the presence of symptoms of the virus, under the same conditions.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is a process of hand purification to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular hand-washing with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted in a fecal-oral way.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold, for example, if he touches his eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous skins) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, after which hands should be washed with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before food, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash.The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after the cooking.
Before and after care procedures.
After changing diapers or washing a baby to the toilet.
After snorkeling, coughing, or sneezing.
After contacting animals, feeds, or wastes of animal origin.
Hand-hygiene refers to hygienic actions related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before taking drugs or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The primary medical aim of washing is to clean up the hands of pathogens (bacteries, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause diseases) and of chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for those who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Handwashing is very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavirus and other communicable diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the rate of infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study showed that better hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration of the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by using simple habits, such as hand-washing and soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the use of hand washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhea by about a third, and this is compatible with the benefit of low-income regions with clean water.
A 48% drop in the number of cases of diarrhea can be associated with the washing of hands with soap. Hands washing with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (PRSs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in each home, in schools and in other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, a major complication of the ORT, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia in general kill nearly 3.5 million children a year.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after food, which has become a solid habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the mortality from diarrhoea by almost half, and death from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out in the context of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted in direct physical contact.
A small negative effect of frequent washing of hands is that it can lead to dried skin and, in fact, to damage.
A 2012 Danish study showed that too frequent washing of hands can lead to sooting and skin swelling – a disease known as eczema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among health-care workers.
Too frequent washing of hands can also be considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (feeding, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (shifting of diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases in which hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after processing the cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or shrivelling, after contacting the waste of an animal or animal, after contacting the trash.
Hand-washing with soap is not common in many countries.
A 2015 study on hand-washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7 per cent of families had had their hands washed with soap as a common practice. A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97 per cent, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the US was in the middle of the list, 77 per cent; the lowest rate was found in China, 23 per cent. There are currently a number of methodologies for changing behaviour and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group hands washing among schoolchildren at the scheduled time of the day is one of the methodologies that help to train children to do so.
The “Emergency Health Program”, implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines, is an example of a wide-ranging effort to promote child health and education.
The national programme is based on deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily soap and fluoride brushing.
The same programme is well under way in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from skin cover is more effective if soap or detergents are added to the washing process.
The main action of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and to raise it.
Water is not in itself considered an effective instrument for skin purification, as the fats and proteins that are components of organic pollution are poorly dissolved in water.
Sufficient water, however, contributes to the process of purification.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, can also contain bacteria that can be found on it in the previous use.
A small number of studies on the skin cover of bacteria from a polluted piece of solid soap suggest that it is unlikely that it will occur, as bacteria are wasted with foam.
The CDC still argues that “liquid soap with a hand-dossor is the preferred option for washing hands”.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended anti-septic or disinfectant means has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
But antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as tricole, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective against antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be in line with the advert.
In addition to the surface-active substance and skin protection, complex compounds may contain acids (acetic, ascorbin, dairy) as a controller for pH, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other excreta (e.g., faith, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). An integrated analysis by the University of Oregon Public Health School showed that, in terms of the prevention of disease and the removal of bacteria from the skin, simple soaps are as effective as the common anti-bakterial soap containing triclozine.
Hot water is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold to remove natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria.
Contrary to popular opinion, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of the microbial burden on the hands.
Hand disinfectant (sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a hand-hygienic tool that contains no water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the use of non-water hand-hygienic means (also known as disinfectant hands-on alcohol, antiseptic hand disinfectants or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, with the addition of sealants, such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or humidifiers, such as glycerine in the form of liquids or foams, which make it easy to use and reduce the effects of the drying of the skin by alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity, and disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectant kills bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), a TB stick, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectant products containing 70% alcohol kill 99,97% of bacteria (the 35-decibel reduction log) on their hands 30 seconds after use and 99,999% (the 4-5 reduction logarithm) on their hands 1 minute after use. Hand disinfectants are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Disinfectant on a alcohol basis is virtually inefficient against viruses of the norvirus (or Norwalk) type, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis, and it is necessary to use enough antiseptic or alcohol-containing means to thoroughly process and saturate the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and back surfaces of both hands, as well as the space between the fingers over the whole length, are spread for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is fully absorbed.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that it choose to wash hands rather than use disinfectants, especially when the hands are heavily polluted.
The growing popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for the full washing of hands if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of disinfectant hands on a alcohol-based basis may cause dry skin if their composition does not contain softening and (or) skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and (or) other softening agents to the product.
In clinical trials, hands disinfectant on a alcohol-based basis, containing softening components, caused much less irritation and dry skin than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact Syndrome or hyperresponsibility to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually non-existent.
The lower probability of an irritant contact dermatitis has become a factor in the choice of disinfectant in comparison to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water means do not purge their hands of organic matter, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that disinfectant hands are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens like regular soap and water, as the use of these means still leaves pathogens in the hands.
The efficiency of the disinfectant for non-alcohol hands depends to a large extent on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than in alcohol or alcohol-containing substances.
Most recently, it has been shown that the drugs that use benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, as opposed to alcohol, which has been shown to be deficient after multiple use, probably due to progressive by-product skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ashes or clay.
Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or ash is polluted by microorganisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, the ash is a disinfectant, as it produces a alkaline solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent contamination, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend the use of hand-washing, which includes the following steps:
Spread your hands under warm or cold flowing water.
It is the flowing water that is recommended, because standing water can be polluted, but the water temperature is irrelevant.
Wash your hands with a lot of soap, including the back of your hands, as well as areas between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap (not just one water).
Trim your hands for at least 20 seconds.
The trembling helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you do, the more germs are removed.
Spread your hands carefully under flowing water.
Spraying hands in standing water can cause recontamination.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry themselves.
The wet and wet hands are more easily polluted, and the most common areas of attention are the thumb, the wrist, the edges between the fingers and under the fingernails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that moisturizing lotion be used to prevent the drying of the skin of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If current water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash hands: water from a hanging jerrican or a bottleneck with holes and (or) the use of ashes, if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. Water-saving solutions, such as foot taps and other inexpensive options, are available in areas with limited water supply (e.g., schools or rural areas in developing countries).
A foot-pedal crane is a simple design, made up of a container suspended on a rope, and a foot lever, which should be pressed to get water on its hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand-drying is an integral part of the hands-hygienic process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much hygienicer than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was carried out by the University of Westminster in London, sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Servants and Towels, which included a comparison of the hygienicity of paper towels, hand-dryers with warmer air and more modern air-dryers for the hands.
After washing and drying the hands in a hot-air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria on the fingertips was on average an increase of 194 per cent and 254 per cent on the palms.
It also turns out that after washing and drying the hands in the airflow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increases by 42 percent, and in the palms by 15 percent.
After washing and drying the hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips is on average reduced to 76 per cent, and on the palms to 77 per cent.
A string-air dryer, which releases air at a rate of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h), is capable of blowing micro-organisms off the hands and from its own block and potentially infecting other users of the toilet and toilet in a radius of up to 2 m.
The use of hot-air hand dryers spread micro-organisms up to a radius of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
No significant microorganisms were detected using paper towels. In 2005 TUV Produkt und Umwelt carried out a study to evaluate different methods of hand-drying.
There are the following changes in the number of bacteria, depending on the method of hand-drying:
There are many different hand-dryers, and hand-dryers are compared to paper towels.
Hand-cleaning with disinfectant napkins can be an alternative to travel in the absence of soap and water.
The hands disinfectant on a alcohol basis must contain at least 60 per cent of the alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignatz Semmelweis found it to be very effective (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in inpatient conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices does help to reduce the level of infection.
The medical washing of hands lasts at least 15 seconds, and a large amount of soap, water or gel is used to wash and wash each part of the hand.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other by crossing their fingers.
If you have dirt under your fingernails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them clean with a clean towel.
A paper towel should be used to close the crane and, if necessary, close and open any doors.
This prevents re-pollution of hands from these surfaces.
The aim of hand-washing in health-care facilities is to remove pathogens ("microbes") and to prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing remains unacceptable in most health-care facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before they touch patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper washing of hands and other basic procedures can reduce the flow of blood associated with the use of the catheter by 66 per cent, and the World Health Organization has published a leaflet showing the standard procedure for washing and hand processing to be applied in the health sector.
The WHO draft manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and open to public discussion.
The review was co-sponsored by Whitby.
If proof of compliance is required, commercial devices may be used to measure and test hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization refers to “five points” when it is necessary to wash hands:
after contact with blood or biological liquids,
before the use of antiseptics, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap in hand-washing ("medical" or "anti-microbial" soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such anti-bakterial properties may be needed before performing surgery or in a high-level antibiotic-resistant environment. “cleaning” of hands before surgery requires a crane that can be switched on and off without touching it; and use a bit of chlor-hexidine or iodine to wash hands, sterile hand-washing towels, a sterile wrinkle and another sterile instrument to clean under the fingernails.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms to the elbow usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands too long, like 10 minutes.
During the stripping, the water with the forearm must not fall back on the hands.
Once the washing is complete, the hands are dried with sterile tissue and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use antiseptic handwork before and after care procedures.
In order to combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of washing was the most useful, and that very few additional benefits had been gained when the hand washing rate had been increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to the washing of anti-bakterial soap, hand washing with normal soap results in more than threefold increases in the frequency of bacterial communicable diseases transmitted through food. The comparison of hand washing with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with anti-bakterial soap, on average, for 30 seconds per procedure, showed that hand treatment with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared to anti-bacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand alcohol solutions in reducing the number of AH1N1 flu viruses and the Clostridium Diphphylium dispute, and activities to promote hand-washing in health-care facilities may include training staff in hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-containing hand-washing solutions, as well as written and oral reminders to staff of the need to wash their hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective types of intervention in the various health-care facilities.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is considered a cost-effective and important means of improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to instill a habit of regularly washing hands.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing cranes, although there are cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, poor handshygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits, not by the lack of soap or water.
The promotion and encouragement of hand-washing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results must be monitored and evaluated.
A system analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve the situation of hands-to-hand hygiene in lower-middle-income countries, health and epidemic surveillance at the community level is effective, while public marketing campaigns are less effective, and one example of advocacy for hand-washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's "Three Star Approach" approach: it promotes simple cost-effective measures in schools to encourage student hands washing with soap, as well as other hygienic requirements.
By meeting minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
Handwashing is one of the possible measures implemented in the context of the hands-hygienic information campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
Global Hand washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of emojis that symbolize the washing of hands.
Some studies have considered the overall efficiency of hand-washing in developing countries in comparison with DALYs (maintened years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that the inducement of hand-washing with soap is a much more economical solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand-washing for human health, particularly for vulnerable groups, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century as two innovators in the field of hand-hygienic health: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English Nurse, and the "founder of modern care".
At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by rotting smells called myasms.
In the 1980s, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become more active in the promotion of hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent infection.
As a result of the outbreak of pork flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with “good hand-washing techniques” were posted in public toilets, as well as in office and airport toilets.
The expression “hands-to-hand” means an expression of a reluctance to accept responsibility for or to be a party to something.
It is derived from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands ” when making the decision to crucify Jesus Christ; it later became more common in some British communities.
In the play "Macbeth" of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands unwittingly in an attempt to clear up the imaginary stain that symbolizes an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes that she committed and prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who remember or observe an unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than others, and handwashers are more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have been able to wash their hands after what they have seen will be involved in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, the washing of hands has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. The use of water to wash hands without soap is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha'i, Hindus, Tevilah, and Netat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Woodhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require hand-washing after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19 involves the application of safety and health-care techniques to control the risk and control the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper control of workplace risks depends on place and work, based on an assessment of the risks, the severity of the epidemic in the community, and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office of Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that posts with lower risk levels have minimal professional contact with the public and their peers, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand-washing, encouraging workers to stay at home for signs of illness, observing respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfecting the working environment.
Middle-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include workers in contact with the public, for example in schools, the high-density working environment and some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic preventive measures, include high-efficiency air filter venting, the use of screens and accessible personal protections in the event of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA is of the view that health-care and morgue staff who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection are in the category of high risk, with the risk being raised to very high levels in the course of aerosol procedures or the collection/ processing of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such personnel include the use of engineering and safety equipment, such as negative pressure venting rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
An outbreak of COVID-19 may have different effects at the workplace.
Employees may be absent from the workplace because of their own illness, the need to take care of others, or the fear of possible contamination.
Business templates may vary both for the types of goods for which there is a demand and for the ways in which such goods are purchased (e.g., purchases in non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without exiting the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Plan for Epidemic Preparedness and Response can be used to organize protection.
The plans address the risks associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors, home and community, as well as the risk factors of individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the monitoring tools needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may result from the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the goals of responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, to protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, to maintain business operations and to minimize the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses are affected by the severity of the disease in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure that is widely used in occupational safety and health to group such tools according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be addressed, the most effective means of safety are engineering, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Security engineering means that employees are isolated from work-related risk sites and do not rely on the employee's behaviour, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in the working policies or procedures that require action by the employee or the employee.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to address some of the risks.
All types of personal protection equipment must be selected according to the threat to the worker, be of a size (e.g. respirators), be used continuously and properly, be regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and be properly filmed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.
The U.S. Office of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) believes that posts with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their peers.
The basic response to the epidemic, recommended for all workplaces, includes frequent and careful hand-washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with respiratory etiquette, including hand-coughing and sneezing, provision of napkins and garbage containers, preparedness for remote or replacement work, as appropriate, for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfecting the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potential contagion is a critical step for the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises staff with acute respiratory symptoms to stay at home until the heat stops, no high body temperature, and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-free drugs or other anti-impaired drugs, and also prescribes flexibility in hospital sheet policy, to allow staff to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and to make staff aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, mid-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the community in the area where the business is located, or in connection with the recent trips of the individual to the locations where COVID-19 is spread.
These categories include workers in contact with the public, e.g. schools, high-density working environment and some major retailers.The engineering and safety tools for such groups and groups at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers, such as transparent plastic protective screens, and the installation of windows for client services without exiting the car. Administrative measures for such a group and groups at higher risk include recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of personal meetings for virtual means of communication, the establishment of washing schedules, the cessation of non-critical trips to the COVID-19 sites, the development of emergency communication plans, including a forum for responding to homeless workers, the provision of up-to-date training for workers on the risk factors of COVID-19 and protection measures, the training of workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, the correct use of such tools, the provision of resources and a work environment conducive to personal health, the requirement for regular washing of hands, the restriction of access to the workplaces, the use of personal and public, the provision of protective clothing, the use of information on the safety of workers, the need for the use of other hand.
In rare cases, workers at such a risk may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick in the plane, measures such as the isolation of a sick person from other people for a distance of six feet, the appointment of a crew member to care for the sick person, the provision of a mask to the sick person, or the request of the person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin in a cough or sneeze are required to ensure the proper safety of workers and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when in contact with physiological liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protection if the patient has a fever, a regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and the contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. In the case of commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, safety measures include the postponement of travel in the event of illness, self-insulation and the prompt notification of the medical centre on board when there is a fever or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical check-up should take place in an isolated cabin, and in the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is in the school building, irrespective of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average rate of infection in the community, social distancing strategies can be introduced, such as the cancellation of private meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as exercise or chorus, taking food in the cafeterias, increasing the distance between the parties, regulating the time of arrival and care, limiting insignificant visits, and the use of a separate location of health-care facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for the long-term non-attendance of school may be considered; for law enforcement officials who perform daily duties, the direct risk to health is considered to be low, in the opinion of the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who are obliged to contact persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 contamination are encouraged to follow the same instructions as are prescribed for paramedics, including the use of suitable personal protections.
In the event of close contact during the period of detention, workers must clean and disinfect their uniforms and equipment before re-use by domestic cleaning aerosols or by anti-handling, observe standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the disposal of used personal protective equipment, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who contact patients with confirmed diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 contamination.
They have a very high risk of infection in the course of their aerosol-induced procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 contamination.
The procedures followed by the formation of aerosols include sounding, coughing, bronchoscopying, some dental procedures, and tests or collection of samples by invasive means.
The staff of the morgues at high risk are those who handle the bodies of persons with a confirmed disease or a suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if they perform an autopsies, they become very high-risk.
In some health-care facilities and morgues, the use of special, negative-pressure vents can be an effective measure.
Samples should be treated in accordance with the precautions for biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the distribution of incoming patients to restricted waiting areas, depending on whether there is a suspicion of COVID-19 contamination. In addition to other personal protections, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers who interact at a distance of up to 6 feet with confirmed patients or suspected of infection with SARS-Cov-2, as well as for those who perform procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosols.
In the US, NIOSH-approved respirators for a person with a N95 or a higher class filter need to be used as part of a comprehensive written programme on respiratory protection, which sets out the requirements for individual selection of funds and medical examinations.
Other types of respirator can provide more effective protection and comfort to the staff member, and WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing, as COVID-19 is a disease transmitted by the respirator rather than by the use of physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the patient reception point.
WHO recommends that those who collect samples from the respiratory paths of patients with COVID-19 or the vectors of the disease, without procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosols, wear a surgical mask, sunglasses or face protection screen, a robe and gloves.
In the course of the procedures followed by the formation of the aerosol, the respirator N95 or FFP2 should be worn instead of the surgical mask.
In view of the insufficient availability of personal protection tools around the world, WHO recommends that the need for such protection be minimized by the use of remote medicine, physical barriers such as so transparent windows, access to COVID-19-infected patients, only those who provide direct care, the use of personal protections that are needed for a specific purpose, the continued use of the same respirator, without removing it, in dealing with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection and the recommendation not to use masks for persons with no symptoms.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Load relief and preparation for the future
DATE/DEVICE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
PURPOSE: CC0: No rights protected
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interconnection of people all over the world and our responsibilities to each other.
We have had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to sympathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the core of such an organization.
We have seen friendly and caring relationships among all our colleagues, as reflected in e-mails, calls, and chats, a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people are working with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to get to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And that's possible thanks to your work, whether it's to make websites work, pay off our peers, or protect the safety of the community.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and this is even more important today than ever before.
At a time like this, not just what we do, but how we do it, is important to achieve meaningful results for the world.
In view of the importance of such a mission and of your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way in which we work together, starting with the coming week.
Adjusting the way we work and schedule
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
In the course of the conversation, we have considered our ideas on how best to deal with the current situation and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to ease the strain and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, let it be.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
We expect it to take about four hours a day or 20 hours a week before further orders are received.
We don't announce weekends: if you can work well for more hours, it's allowed for our mission.
But the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether you care for your family, buy food or go to a doctor's office, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't keep track of your time.
If you're ill, you don't have to work.
This is clear and undeniable, but we recall it.
There is no need for a hospital sheet or a day off: just inform your supervisor and help the team to re-evaluate the calendar and schedule to cover key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and proper attention from management to your situation).
The hourly rates will be fully paid.
We have already declared and reaffirmed our intention to meet the obligations of our contractors and staff at an hourly rate.
Each person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This involves, in particular, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll back you up.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can produce remarkable results, especially in times like this.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to interact with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered to be significant.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety, and Fundraising (also) teams perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and to shift the focus to support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.
Slowing today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “two more to catch up” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to meet the unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timetables, if possible.
What's going on with the APP (yearly plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the time frame for the implementation of our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to offer an extension of time for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budget-making, which will enable staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care, with a shortened schedule for the next few weeks for all who need or want to work.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, inform representatives and teams of the relevant information on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
Thanks to the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco might be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
But, in addition to a lot of precautions, we hired an anti-virus cleanup team to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used the antiviral medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the reception and lift halls, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules of care, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in D.C. (DC) is on the web of WeWork, which shared with us and all the staff in DC its COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in D.C. moved completely to remote work in accordance with the instructions given in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed renting a place in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues, working remotely, are aware of the possibility of correcting the situation and would like to give you some tips:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one to two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider the possibility of splitting them into a course of several days.
Define clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda, and forward the material in advance.
By default, use video links to facilitate interaction and communication, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For ease of reference, appoint a focal point, who will follow up the questions in the chat room and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the one responsible for the notes (or joint notes).
If necessary, contact the Technical Support Service by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement when you buy snacks.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your peers about the distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying the ergonomics manuals, which are available in webcast format, to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grantees to cancel the mass activities financed by Wikimedia, such as "editathons", until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may lead to the impossibility of carrying out agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for having to delay or change such objectives.
In the coming week, we will conduct follow-up activities with further guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The global sentiment in the global community is not only a resentment over the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief over the understanding and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not just that.
In terms of prospects, CRT is working on the Meta-Wiki page, which will provide space for the community to monitor exposure and communication.
We stay in touch on matters related to COVID-19.
We'll send an invitation to a special staff meeting in your calendar next Thursday, 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take the opportunity to share more relevant information, to answer your questions, and to spend time with each other.
We're together in this situation, and we're ready to help anything we can.
You can continue to receive information from this e-mail, while other important information on COVID-19 is from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If there are questions about trips, events, key workflows, lighting problems or other assistance, contact the CRT.
We are ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If privacy problems arise, contact Brian Joudan, director of HR International Global Operations, by e-mail.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible ongoing need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the right time.
Today it is time to support one another and to create space for the important work to be done in the coming weeks and possibly months.
For that to happen, we will need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, as well as to work with maximum success as soon as such a need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katerine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and the rest of the Team Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotenzine converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 is countering the activity of the relevant angiotenzine-transverse enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotenzin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 is also a point of entry to the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as haCE2.
Angiotenzine-transverse enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal ferment on the surface of endotiles and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-end peptidetic domain of M2 and the C-end transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, and its enzyme active domain reaches the surface of the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular domain is segregated from the trans-membrane domain by a different enzyme, known as shaddas, and the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually extracted with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most of the pulmonary pulmonary cells of type II, enterocytes of the thin intestine, arterial and venous endotal cells, and cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The biosynthesis of the ACE2 IRNA is also found in the cortex of the brain, the stratum, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
The ACE splits the hormone angiotensin I into the vascular tract angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, recaptures the carboxide endicular amino acid phenylalanzine from angiotenzine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it to the vasodiolytic angiotenzine (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also split a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - bradikinin, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greasing.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main point of entry to the cells for some coronaviruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-Cov (SARS); and SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, the sequestration of S1 of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 protein to the enzyme of ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and transposition of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomes inside the cell.
This entry process also requires the imitation of the S protein with a Serial Protease of the TMPRSS2 medium, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, which has led some to think that lowering the ACE2 levels in the cells can help in the fight against infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend that standard APF and BRA inhibitors should continue.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant 34 per cent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received APF inhibitors, who were at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in the death rate from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than for patients with a common risk of pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhaCE2) is supposed to be an innovation in therapies for acute pulmonary damage and is likely to improve pulmonary hemodynomics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolisharides.
The half-life rhaCE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the start of the operation is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of 24 hours.
Some data suggest that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with the intransigence of classical renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases that have increased circulating angiotense II. The introduced rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical tests in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile phone applications designed to assist in the epidemiology of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. in the identification of persons (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
A number of options for contact tracking applications have been developed.
This has led to a discussion of privacy issues, particularly with respect to systems that are based on the geographical location of the users of the applications.
The softer options in this respect include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate the Bluetooth support function directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipai, launched an application that allows citizens to check whether they had contact with people living with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore it is used by an app called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code, and will be placed under the control of the Government. North Macedonia has launched the "StopKorona" application, working on Bluetooth, to help track contact with potentially infected people and to provide operational contact with health-care authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was expected to be registered with Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking app was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks, and similar applications are scheduled to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the use of applications based on the Singapore TraceTagether application and BlueTrace protocol, and Russia intends to use an application with a geozone function to ensure that patients with COVID-19 diagnosed in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor in security, University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false reactions and potential inefficiency if the application is used by a small part of the population.
In view of concerns about the proliferation of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their Coronavirus applications to the App Store to include only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
The privacy campaign expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance of the population through Coronavirus applications; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure established to combat the Coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat would disappear.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of oversight.
The organizations have declared eight conditions for public projects:
Monitoring should be “legitimate, necessary and proportionate”;
The extension of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by time limits;
The use of data should be limited to the purpose of controlling the proliferation of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and evidence of such security must be provided;
Digital surveillance should prevent cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the level of law;
Protection from abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published their list of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the problem of ongoing monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, web-based positioning is used instead of applications, which excludes the need to download the application and the possibility of avoiding traceability.
In Israel, online tracking was approved.
Network solutions, which have access to basic location data, also have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal position data; a number of systems have been developed with privacy, which use central servers for communication only (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis was used to track contact.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected traceability information from various sources, including traceability of mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then combined them to create notification in the form of text messages that had been sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government had not only used this information to alert citizens to potential contact with infected persons, but had also made the information on the location available to the public, which had been made possible by the significant changes in the legislation on the protection of information that had been made following the MERS outbreak in that country.
Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites; countries, including Germany, are considering the use of both central and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
As of April 7, 2020, more than 10 expert groups had been working on privacy solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both central and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized traceability with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile contact tracking (PACT) mechanisms, etc.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the identification of the identity never leaves the device and that all comparisons are made on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform to maintain privacy in the collection and use of location or cross-track data to track the distribution of COVID-19.
The platform's work is based on the studies published in March 2020 by Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware to allow users to exchange confidential data on location and health with other users and officials, without compromising the confidentiality of the data.
On 5 April 2020, a global coalition of TCNs was established by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global compatibility of the tracking and alert applications, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore Government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact-tracking initiative that they claimed would provide privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography to keep privacy.
They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be rolled out in three stages:
Development of tools to enable Governments to create formal applications to track the movement of infected citizens, but with data privacy
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google, and Apple, they plan to solve the problem of constant surveillance by first introducing the system through the update of the operating system, and then remove it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Repositioning a drug (also known as reprofiling, redirecting, changing tasks, or redirecting drugs) is the reprofiling of an approved drug to treat a disease or a medical condition different from that originally envisaged in the design.
This is one of the areas of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other studies include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of reconvalescent plasma.
The analysis of these sequestration sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective anti-viral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-Cov-2 are Papal-like proteasy, RNA-dependant RNA-polymerase, helica, squirrel S, and ADF-ribophosphasis.
Hussain AA and the co-authors in their doclinical study studied a number of candidate compounds, which were then optimized, and analysed their similarity with the most similar approved drugs, in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-Cov-2, which will be recommended for clinical research.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the “Solidarity” clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that the tests of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would start in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate in accordance with the emergency use permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is only allowed under EUA as a pilot treatment for emergency treatment for patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under the clinical trial scheme.
The CDC stated that “the use, dosing or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-Cov-2” had not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when there's no other way out.
The Turkish Study Group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine, combined with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The University of New York School of Medicine in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
China's clinical trials in Uhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravirus is “singlely effective.”
For the 35 patients in Shenzhen who had taken the drug, the negative result was averaged four days later, while for the 45 patients who had not taken the drug, the duration of the disease was 11 days.
In Uhan, a study was carried out to monitor 240 pneumonia patients, one half of whom received a favipiravirus and the other half a Umithenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Authority had reminded the public that the results of the drug's effectiveness were scarce and should not be considered final.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy a drug in Japan to replenish its stocks, and that it would use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe informed the Trump administration of the possibility of buying a drug, and the drug may be less effective in neglected cases.
It may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who try to get pregnant.
A study on the combination of anti-virus drugs, the “lopinavier” and the “ritonavirus” (Caletra), concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been identified”.
The drugs have been designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by tying it to the protease.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a connection that will be linked to the SARS-Cov-2 protesis, and the scientific community is criticizing the reprofiling of drugs that have been specially developed for HIV and AIDS therapy.
WHO has included a combination of lopinavirus and ritonavirus in the international test of Solidarity.
The Remdesivere was created and developed by the Guiled Sciences to treat the Ebola virus and the Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later found that the Remdesivere had antiviral activity in vitro for a multiplicity of philo, pneumo, paramix, and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with anti-virus treatment is the development of resistance through mutations, which can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies have shown that the remdesivere may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical tests are currently being conducted, including two by the University of Cleveland; one by moderately ill patients; and the other by patients with more severe forms.
There are currently three clinical tests for injecting vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, the state of New York began testing antibiotics for azitromycin.
The Japan National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclonesonide) Taijin, an inhalation corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma, for use in the treatment of pre-synthetic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II, the form of angiotenzine converting enzyme 2, is being tested with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who are hospitalized with severe forms of disease to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with low levels of COVID-19.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization were invited.
Pregnant, breast-feeding women who do not use effective contraceptives cannot take part in the study.
In Italy, several coagulants are being tested.
Low-molekular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has prompted the Italian Department of Medicine to publish recommendations for the use of the drug.
On 14 April, a multicentury study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy on the use of sodium enoxaparian in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-Cov-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on the reprofiling of approved anti-virus drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS, and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in line with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendation.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in line with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially suitable for use in the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has been clinically tested, many attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect the ARS-Cov-2 virus vaccine to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were screened for phase I security studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread all over the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-Cov-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI initiative for the development of vaccines are to provide the required speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms for an effective vaccine against COVID-19 were in the process of being explored and developed in early 2020.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the Phase I security study:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, RNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenomivirus vector type 5)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are being used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 other vaccines have been reported but are not publicly available (presumably in the planning or development stage).
Phases I to II carry out pre-tests for safety and immunogeneity, usually Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, and at several sites, while at the same time defining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III of the tests usually involves more participants, including the control group; at this stage the drugs are tested for disease prevention efficiency while at the same time the side effects are monitored at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccines under active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on a human being (although doclinical studies are still under way).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamped vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) of Saskatchewan University, Canada, announced that it had begun work on its own vaccine to start human testing in 2021.
The launch of vaccine projects was also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, Jansen's pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneke Schuitmaeker, announced the start of work on the development of their vaccine.
Jansen is working with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart for the development of a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, OncoGen Lab in Romania published a document on the development of a vaccine on a technology similar to that used for vaccines against neoantagen cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the Institute for Research announced the completion of the vaccine synthesis and the start of the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, Nu Generex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was launching a project to develop the Ii-Key Peptide Vaccine against COVID-19.
Their aim was to develop a vaccine-candidate drug that could be tested on people in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington, St. Louis, announced its vaccine development projects.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, and the Army Research Institute, Walter Reed, Silver Spring, located in the west of Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosoluties announced that she had entered into a partnership with Novax Inc.
To develop and produce a vaccine.
The partners have also announced plans for the doclinical and clinical tests of phase I by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that it would take at least one-and-a-half or two years to develop a vaccine, even in an accelerated mode.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec, reported that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they had created a coronavirus-like particle.
A potential vaccine is being conducted in laboratory studies, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "higher sums of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the United States Pharmaceutical Company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an IRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for an IRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing doclinical tests, and the clinical trial will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive the results of the doclinical tests in April 2020, and that their final vaccine candidate could start testing on humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), France, announced an investment of $4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaccine Development Consortium, with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscence (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
The other partners of the CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford, and University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-implementing RNA-vaccine from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate drug was developed within 14 days of a sequencing from China.
In late March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 275 million Canadian dollars to finance 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccines for vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government has announced the allocation of US$ 192 million specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans to create a national “vaccine bank”, which will include a number of new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronavirus.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, saying that "MNA injected sub-equivalent SARS-COV-2 S1, causing strong anti-gen-special antibodies [in mice] responses that had been shown two weeks after the immunization.
On April 16, 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmaceuticals at Waterloo University announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that might be produced in the form of bulk spray.
With bacteriophages, DNA will reproduce within human bacteria and produce harmless viral-like particles that can induce the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities combined IBM supercomputers with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologic effects, also called non-special effects.
This means that they can have other benefits than disease prevention properties.
Another case-by-case study in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines that are being developed may be unsafe or inefficient.
Early studies on the effectiveness of animal-based vaccines, which are characteristic of COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, point to the need for measures to contain infection with biosafety 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines for the treatment of SARS that are safe and effective for humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world, and there is no verified vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the SARS study that had been conducted at the time could be the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-Cov infection.
As of March 2020, there was one ( DNA-based) MERS vaccine that had passed phase I of the human clinical trial, and three more, all of which were virus vector-based vaccines and were in the process of being developed, two were adenovirus (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA-vectoral (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media spread the concept of conspiracy, which claimed that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all, and that a vaccine for it already existed.
Social media publications quoted some patients who claimed to have patents on genetic sequencing of other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by acute coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing, and respiratory problems.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between the first symptom and the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases are mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease is contagious to viral pneumonia and polyorganic insufficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and over 153,000 had died of the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is spread mainly through close contact between people, often through microscopic drops, released into the air by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these drops are formed by exhalation, they are usually a threat by coming to the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air at long distances.
People also become infected with polluted surfaces, and then with their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after the symptoms appear, although it can be spread both before the symptoms occur and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymeraceous chain reaction with real-time back-translation (RT-PRC) on a sample taken as a swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients suspected of being ill, as well as to those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks differ: some departments recommend that they not be used at all, some recommend their use and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
The local spread of the disease was reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and breath.
The acute symptoms include difficulty in breathing, constant pain or a sense of strangulation in the breast, confusion of mind, difficulty in awakening, facial or lip blueness; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought without delay.
Sneaking, shrivelling, or throat pain can be more acutely symptomatic of upper respiratory tracts.
Also, in different percentages there are gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Some of the cases reported in China have initially been characterized by a feeling of breast depression and a more frequent heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress as it develops in pneumonia, polyorganic insufficiency, and eventually dies.
It's called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5 per cent of the population, the symptoms begin to manifest within 11.5 days of infection, and according to the available data, the symptoms do not all of them.
The role of such unsymptomic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary data indicate that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of people infected with the virus is currently unknown and is only being studied, while the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations of the virus, the disease was symptomless.
The National Health Commission of China began to include non-symptomatic cases in its daily report as of 1 April; of the 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78%) had been rejected as non-symptomous at the time of testing.
Both wet and saliva can have a greater concentration of the virus.
In a loud speech, more drops are released into the air than in a normal volume speech.
A study in Singapore found that the drops can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) in open cough.
The virus is generally not airborne, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transfer of the virus by bioerosol is still possible, and the testing of air reprocessed by air collectors located in the corridors outside the people's rooms has shown the presence of a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (CLR), can lead to the dispersal of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through feces, but the risk is considered low; the virus is the most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before the symptoms occur, but the risk is small.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that it is not clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually infects 2 to 3 others, and the virus can survive on the surface from hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus can live on the cardboard surface for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% of the copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These figures, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, when properly used, have a very useful effect in controlling infection: soap destroys the fat layer of the virus, deactivates it, and can remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorgexide gluconate (surgical disinfectant) are less effective against the virus, and in a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
For five out of six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and for the sixth patient, the highest level of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of the test.
The severe acute coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CV-2) is a new acute coronavirus Syndrome that was first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-Cov-2 virus are also found in natural coronaviruses.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the home soap, which opens up its protective shell.
The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19, as the virus penetrates host cells through angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in pulmonary pulmonary cells of type II.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell by means of a characteristic surface glycoprothein, the "spike" (peplomer).
12 per cent of the infected people admitted to the hospital in Uhan have been diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in a severe form of disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the system inflammatory response and the disorders of the immune system observed during the progression of the disease, but acute damage to myocardium may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in large numbers in the heart because they are involved in the work of this body.
A high rate of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolia (25%) was observed in patients in the ISA with COVID-19, and may indicate bad predictions. The autopsis of patients killed by COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveorrhoids (DAD) and lymphocytic inflammatory inhalants in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a tropic to ACE2-expressing epithelic tract cells, patients with a heavy flow of COVID-19 have symptoms of system hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that GM-XF T-cell pathogens correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes emitting IL-6 and heavy lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocitar infiltrates were also found in the autopsy.
WHO has also published several test protocols for the disease.
A real-time polymeric chain reaction (RT-PRC) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respirator samples obtained from a swab, but may also use a swab sample from the nose or wet.
The results are usually available for a period of between a few hours and two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at a time interval of two weeks, and the results are not of direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to extract a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequencing so that scientists in labs around the world can self-develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of the virus.
As at 4 April 2020, antibodies tests that might have been able to detect infection at the present time, as well as possible past infections, had been under development but had not yet been widely disseminated.
China's experience with the results of these tests has shown that they are only 60 to 70% accurate.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Department of Food and Drug Quality Control (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, allowing it to be used at the end of this month.
Bilateral multi-pronged sub-propellant compaction tricks of the type of “matter glass” with peripheral, asymmetrical and a posterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, the symptom of a rocky bridge (extensive chunking of a variable alveolar) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic injuries and pathology of COVID-19.
Main results of the pathology study carried out during the autopsy:
Macroscope: pleurite, pericarditis, compaction and lung swelling
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light form of pneumonia: lung edema, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytary infiltration, and multi-nuclear giant cell formation
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar excude.
DAD is the cause of acute respirator distress Syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoximia.
Healing pneumonia: the organization of excite in alveolar fields and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Difficult intra-circulatory clotting (DVS) Syndrome; leukaeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include stay at home, the avoidance of crowded spaces, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with the rules of respiratory hygiene, and the avoidance of touches on the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the ulna.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a quality hand-hygienic procedure be carried out.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public spaces, in particular to limit the transmission of infections by persons with an unsymptomed flow of the disease; social remoteness strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and enterprises, restricted the movement of citizens and eliminated major public activities.
Distance recommendations also mean that people must be at least six feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no drugs with confirmed effectiveness against COVID-19. As the development of the vaccine is not expected to be completed before 2021, the bulk of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the “to-plateau” epidemic.
CDC also recommends that hands with soap and water should be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or severe hand contamination, as well as before food and after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of alcohol disinfectant (alcohol content at least 60 per cent) for hand processing, but only when soap and water are not available, and WHO provides two receptors for local production to regions where such disinfectant is not sold.
These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial disputes in alcohol and is not a suitable tool for antiseptic hand processing.
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
Patients are shown support therapy, which may include infusion therapy, Oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect to be infected with the virus wear a common medical mask.
Extracorporal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) was used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Respect for personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diet are recommended to strengthen immunity.
Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease, and WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the U.S., intensive care doctors and pulmonologists summed up the therapeutic advice of various institutions in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
In order to treat the symptoms as first-line drugs, some health professionals recommend a choice for paracetamol (acetaminophen) in relation to ibuprofen.
Precautionary measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in health-care facilities, when carrying out procedures that may result in air-capable releases, such as intubation or hand-drying.
The CDC recommends that health-care workers who care for people with COVID-19 should be placed in an air cell (AIIR), an additional measure, in addition to the standard precautions for contact and air, and the CDC has issued recommendations on the use of personal protection devices (PISs) during the pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves; it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
The N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the Emergency Application Permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but, when used not according to the instructions, the protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If the medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective face screens or, at the very least, the making of masks on your own in the home.
In most cases, the forms of the current COVID-19 are not heavy enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or an alternative to it, but there is also a percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized infirmary patients associated with COVID-19 is currently under active study, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by means of an air-intensive bow-to-acid cable or a two-level positive pressure in the airway.
It is not yet clear whether any of these two ways is as effective for patients in critical condition as SVL.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to the high-velocity nose canwels, and the risk of severe diseases for older persons (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there is a shortage of hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the dramatic increase in the incidence of COVID-19 infections in a critical form that requires hospitalization.
According to a study in China, 5 per cent of patients had been hospitalized in intensive care, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for their lungs, and 1.4 per cent had died.
In China, about 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of artificially ventilating the lungs is more complex, as acute respirator distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops with COVID-19, and oxygen is causing more and more problems.
A VLF with inhalation pressure and a PCR is required to deliver maximum oxygen to the lungs and to provide a minimum of damage by ventilating, which can result in pneumothorax.
In earlier ventilator models, a high PVC may not be available.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and several anti-virus drugs are currently in the process of clinical trial.
The most promising is the Remdesire.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested for patients with severe diseases.
Recommended by WHO, volunteers are involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted a temporary permit for the use of reconvalescent plasma as a pilot treatment in cases where life is in serious or immediate danger.
It has not been subject to clinical research to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat the outbreak.
Users must enter their name and identification number to log in.
The application can detect a “near contact” by means of observation data and, therefore, the potential risk of contamination.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-insulation but also sends a notice to the local health authorities; large-scale data analysis from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, traceability of mobile phones, and artificial intelligence, such tools are used to track infected people and people they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to track the data of the mobile phones of people allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Quarantine and protection measures had been taken for persons who might contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, he provided the federal government agencies of Germany and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology was introduced to detect violators of the quarantine.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said that cellular network operators reported that “40% of the people are still moving around the Territory.”
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour weekend programming marathon, in which more than 42,000 participants participated.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Calulaid, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People can experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor: “Enhanced social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming the mental health and well-being of people.”
Diseases can take place in a mild form with little or no symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds.
Patients with a mild form of illness tend to recover within two weeks, while the treatment of patients with severe or critical forms may take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of having a severe form of COVID-19 on the basis of data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although no such data are available for COVID-19. Some people may be hit by COVID-19 and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In the case of persons with the most severe current of the disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory dispersal Syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or polyorganic failure.
Compounds of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thorax, and heart, kidney, and liver problems.
Anomalies of thrombosis, particularly the increase in protrombin time, have been described in 6 per cent of the patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while 4 per cent of the group suffers from kidney failure.
About 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early studies, the average time between initial symptoms and the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study carried out by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 per cent and for women 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of postmortem lung samples indicate a diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exsuates in both lungs.
There were viral cytopathic changes in the pneumocytes.
The look of the lung was like the acute respirator distress Syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were the increase in the level of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the availability of health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary according to state due to such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequate estimates of cases in an easy form may result in an overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that death occurs as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current death rate is undervalued.
In the case of smokers, the severe symptoms of COVID-19 have developed a total of 1.4 times more, with about 2.4 times more people in need of intensive care or dying than non-smokers, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of a hospital in Hong Kong found that some patients who had recovered from the disease had reduced their lungs by between 20 and 30 per cent, and their scans had revealed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to “After Intensive Care” Syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not clear whether virus-generated patients had permanent immunity against the virus.
According to the current of other coronaviruses, this is believed to be possible, but cases have also been reported where the coronavirus test was still positive after recovery from COVID-19.
In these cases, it is believed that there was an exacerbation of the prolonged period of the disease, not a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, animal and infectious.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, describes 1 December 2019 as the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, the date is 8 December 2019.
There are usually several methods used to measure mortality.
All figures vary according to the region and the time of the spread of the disease, and are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the parameters of the population, such as age, gender and general health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency code: U07.1 for deaths due to a laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-Cov-2 and U07.2 for deaths due to a clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of the infection of SARS-Cov-2. The ratio of deaths to infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153,822/2, 240,191).
This figure varies from region to region, and some other methods include the determination of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died as a result of the disease, as well as the rate of death due to the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the figures of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced by all patients who have been infected, the presence of such antibodies makes it clear how many people have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castillon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the celebration of carnival to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overstretched.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population can have antibodies, according to the blood supply.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The group most at risk is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women has narrowed only since the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-specific immunological differences, lower incidence of female smoking, associated with male diseases (e.g. hypertension in men at a younger age than in women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were men, and 72 per cent of the deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not maintained gender statistics for COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, the flu, and EPRI, have different gender statistics.
The majority of health-care workers, particularly nurses, are women, and therefore have a better chance of becoming infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tetros Adanom Gebreus, explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease” and 19 is the year when the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
This name was selected to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of humans, as required by international recommendations for naming to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the severe acute coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO uses the terms “COVID-19” and “COVID-19” in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus themselves are commonly called the Coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Uhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly called the "Kronavirus" and the "Hahana Coronavirus".
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical sites in the name of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “stroke respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as the temporary name of the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official titles "COVID-19" and "SARS-COV-2" were published.
Due to the limits on the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials, such as nose swabs, as well as details of the SVL machines.
In one such case, the Italian clinic was in urgent need of a vent valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it in the required time, and one of the local industries was re-profiled and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various theories of conspiration, misinformation and false information about the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the virus began to spread at a high rate on the Internet.
It's possible that humans can infect the virus with other animals.
Research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At the moment, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or for drugs to treat it.
Various international studies on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY Test) programme, the aim of which is to assess the treatment effect of the four existing compounds considered to be most effective to date.
There is no ready-made vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine-candidates.
Both the SARS-Cov and the SARS-Cov-2 penetrate human cells with the ACE2 receptor, so the results of previous studies on SARS-Cov are used in research.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a complete virio vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead form, is intended to induce a quick human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a sub-equivalent vaccine, is to create a vaccine that increases the immune system's sensitivity to certain sub-elements of the virus.
In the case of SARS-Cov-2, such studies aim at the destruction of the S-sharp protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA or RNA-vaccines, new vaccine-making method).
Experimental vaccines developed for any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of the vaccine began in Seattle on four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code, copied from the virus that causes the disease, and the anti-teleosavirus has been identified as a potential problem in the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials had been conducted.
The drugs approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven tests, four of them for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The reprofiling of anti-virus drugs is the bulk of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III studies had been carried out in a number of countries.
As of April 2020, the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 had been reviewed dynamically. For the same purpose, several other existing anti-virus drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered, including remdesivere, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavirus/ritonavirus, and lopinavirus/ritonavirus, combined with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of the use of remdesvires.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients who had received the Remdesire as an exception.
Phase III of the clinical trial is already under way in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used for malaria treatment, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubleing the dose is very dangerous and can lead to fatality.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a permit for the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high levels of fishavirus are needed to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for a detailed study in vivo by demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations.
Research on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has serious limitations that prevent the health community from using these treatments without more detailed study. Oceltamivir does not inhibit SARS-Cov-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemy may occur as a complication at late stages of the heavy form COVID-19.
There is evidence of the fact that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinemy properties, and a small study by the National Health Commission of China has included tozilysumab in the recommendation for the treatment of coronavirus.
This drug has reached stage 2 of a non-randomized test, which is being conducted at the national level in Italy, after positive results have been obtained from patients with severe diseases.
Combined with a blood serum test on ferritin to detect cytokin storms, it is designed to counter factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved antagonist interlakin-6 receptor based on retrospective case studies to treat the release of steroid refractory cytokine due to another cause, the CAR T-cell therapie.
To date, there is no renegotiated and controlled evidence that tozilysumab is an effective means of treating the Cytokin release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the COVID-19 immune systems to people in need is now seen as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but the results were not convincing.
Neutralizing the virus is the expected effect that passive antibodies therapy can provide protection against SARS-Cov-2.
However, it is possible to use other mechanisms, such as anti-body-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibodies therapy, such as those made with monoclonial antibodies, are in the process of being developed.
The use of reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of healed patients and contains antibodies against the virus, can be increased.
