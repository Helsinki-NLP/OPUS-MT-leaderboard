From my point of view, the programme of literature was formed by the ladies of Balzakov age on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature in the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volgonski.
They've been writing bleachers, of course, from the point of view of those Balzacian ladies.
And Psychology and the agony of Tolstoy and Turgenev's heroes are not that interesting for teenagers.
Teens are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very, very much.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Micropacket Prestige: Comfortability and nature.
The mattress has different rigidities: the medium-strong surface is made up of latex coconut fiber and natural latex, and moderately soft is a natural latex plate.
A spring block of 1,000 springs per square metre is quickly adapted to the body of a sleeper, warning that the effect of a "wave" or "gamac" will emerge.
One of the merits of the model is to identify breathing material.
The latex, perforated for air-tightness, is ventilated in a natural way, as is the coconut coke.
As a result, a healthy microclimate of the bed is maintained.
The mattress is also subject to an extended guarantee period.
The official guarantee from the producer is five years old, in fact the life of the mattress is longer.
The protection against dust and pollution is in the removable jaccard cover supplied in a kit.
A pair to the mattress of an orthopaedic pillow is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during your sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - the coconut is an anatomical back support, the latex relaxes the muscles.

With horror, I remember these tablets and the guests at my parents' home.
The guests are on the doorstep, and the cookies are still on the stove, and the mom is chopping the floor.
Oh, my God, I've had enough to sit at the table.
And then I'll wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the party, you bring out the groceries, two days of cooking, day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They're good, and they're gonna have to have the cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I'm going to make a small table.
And I make them flavor, and I bake them all the time for nothing.
Germany: A fourth inoculation against the coronavirus is inevitable
A fourth vaccination will take place in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with new force.
Despite an intensive vaccination campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient for full protection.
This is the conviction of the head of the Ullrich Wygeldt Association of General Practitioners.
On Saturday, December 11th, Die Welt reported it.
"We expect a fourth vaccination to take place in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigoldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccine can be carried out “in combination with flu vaccines”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccinations can help to combat the spread of the new strain of the Coronauvirus “Omikron”.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
So the probability of re-infecting Omicron is three times as high as that of Delta or Beta.
This is evident from a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
On this basis, BioNetech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies stress that the two doses of the vaccine do not offer sufficient protection against infection by the new version of the Omicron Coronavirus.
A study by Biontech and Pfizer showed that at two doses of the vaccine, the efficiency is significantly lower: "neutralizing capacity is more than 25 times lower."
"This indicates that the two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron-stamp contamination," stressed Bionetech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
The experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the president of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of shortening the interval between the second and third inoculations.
Moreover, according to the Salzberger, accelerated vaccinations will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“The experience of Israel is very convincing,” the expert stressed.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) is different from the many other Vibs by what was originally designed to be used for ice-fishing, not just for insecting.
These vibes have more than the size of analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another common feature is the top fin of solid and solid plastic, which produces additional vibrations in vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter-ass" catch, Bet-A-Vib shows a rather aggressive game.
Often, the most catchy thing is a simple monotone animation, that is, the move of the oar up and down is almost without pause.
In planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very high, which is convenient for catching in a limited space, overwhelmed by underwater vegetation, root, and other obstacles beyond which the chain is possible.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant for catching a fisherman and a large fisherman in the winter, particularly in the middle of the winter, when a point-and-aggressive bait is required.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib immediately unfolds and returns to the reference vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also used for the winter catch of pond trout.
To satisfy her whims, you can choose from two variants: NS - NanoSound (NS) or SL - Silent (Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game is capable of irritating a passive peacock that does not even react to a live person.
Bet-A-Vib shows range and accuracy when caught.
This vobulary is clear and unchallenged, well combined with the leash and the braided cords, even the big diameters.
In order to catch a scab, a stew, arch, or a buckle, apart from even-handed, it's relevant, and "stripping," sometimes with a "stripping" down the floor.
If you catch in indelible places, you can change the front triangle to the double, which will reduce the probability of a lead.
Among the baits of his class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most resilient and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With the same success, it is possible to use both relatively small and relatively deep plots.
All the models are equipped with OWner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries were declared
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries in Libya from the private military company Wagner.
This was announced on Sunday, 12 December, by the President of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled Al-Mishri.
“There are currently more than 7,000 mercenaries in Libya who have been hired by Wagner.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Coofra.
They have 30 jets on the Gardabia airbases (also used as a civil airport in Sirte) " , quoted by Anadolu.
Khaled Al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries “are trying to seize” the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after “taking their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Save Presence
According to the interviewer, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “placed in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufr, as reported in the Agency's publication.
The Russian authorities have officially denied that the Kremlin has the support of Vagner.
Where else might be mercenaries
According to the Agency, Wagner is believed to be active in nine countries in Africa - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection to leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Vagnera's subsidiaries are granted certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of arms, technology and military services to those countries,” the article states.
According to the media, the Wagners allegedly fought in Donbassa, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan, and the CAR.
This group is not listed in the law enforcement agencies or in the lawn register, and its fighters are not included in the uniformed lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
In the past, 27 EU countries had previously approved the restractions against Wagner.
The EU Council is expected to adopt this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second House of Parliament, with advisory functions to the dominant Islamists, by TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the election of members of Parliament and the Head of State from 24 December at least to February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will pass on time are rapidly declining," notes the material.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, and broadcasts Sky News Arabia.
Foreign Politics by the Eyes of Russia
Thirty-eight percent of Russians see the country as more successful in foreign policy than failure, and 29 percent believe that failure predominates.
"Examples of success - "in Syria protected, restored peace there," "the North Stream-2 decision," "the whole world terrorized that the cool weapons," "The Crime We Reject."
The main setbacks are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from the world”, says a study by the Foundation for Public Opinion.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned the paperwork - all public services have become digital too.
The Government of Dubai reported a complete phase-out of paper management and a shift to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided to the public in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirat news agency WAM.
“Today marks the beginning of a new stage of digitization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a complete paperless government,” said the Crown Prince of the Amirate, President of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktum on Saturday.
The internal and external documentation of all state institutions in Dubai will now be digitalized only through special information platforms.
The new development has affected all sectors, without exception: health, LAC, the police, municipal authorities, the courts, etc. Many commercial entities have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to e-government and the digitalization of documentation began in Dubai in 2018.
During that time, the authorities estimated that 336 million paper sheets had been saved, which was 14 million hours of human work and 353.8 million dollars in cash equivalent.
Formerly, the mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobynin, stated that e-services save citizens 2 days a year.

The production and export of Turkish cars fell below the 2020 level
The production and export of Turkish cars fell sharply in November, as lira depreciated.
As a result, industry performance for 11 months was worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were manufactured in Turkey, 20 per cent less than the year before.
Some 75,000 machines have been sent for export, more than 25 per cent below last year ' s figure.
While the car sector in Turkey had shown a positive turnaround by the past year in the first 10 months of this year, the 11 months of 2021 had already turned out to be 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for the fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November was 29 per cent relative to the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 UXO entities received a credit extension in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, spoke about the situation of small- and medium-sized business benefits, handing over to MIA correspondent Cazinform.
“In accordance with the information provided by the Agency for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, pursuant to the request of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 of 9 April 2021 approving the procedure for the granting of deferred payments for small and medium-sized business entities,” Alihan Smaïlov wrote in his reply to the parliamentary request.
He recalled that the procedure for the granting of deferrals of loan payments by banks and micro-financed entities provided for the deferral of payments of loans issued prior to 1 April 2021 to entities of the HCM, including the PPI, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The deferral period was between 30 and 90 days at the choice of the subject of the HCM.
The borrower's application may have included a different period for the deferral of payments.
During the period of deferral, the claimant's work, notice of the need to pay outstanding debts, as well as the commission's creditor's collection and other charges were suspended against the borrower,” noted the vice-premier.
In 2021, the second-level banks received applications for the deferral of payments to 603 BMS borrowers, of which 553 were granted a 9.7 billion tenge of HCM.
The IFI has applied for a stay of 131 UXO entities, of which 95 are granted a stay of 105.8 million tenge,” concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Purasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the strain of "ocmiro"
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity can carry it more easily than those with a strong protective reaction from the body.
Pulmonologist Sergey Purasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "ocmiron" might prove dangerous.
It's worth looking for when the virus is born.
Scientists believe that the “ocmiron” was born in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
I mean, when he mutated, he didn't find any resistance to immunity.
That makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response to the immunity, it was very fast.
Apparently, he's got these spikes, spikes, maybe more than proper, their antibodies not cut off during mutations, commenting the pulmonologist Sergey Purasev.
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity can carry the "ocmiro" more easily than those with a strong body's protective reaction.
Turns out the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens in pneumococcal infections, when a 30-year-old dies, and old 60-year-olds pass it in the form of a sneeze.
The immune answer to the young man is rabid, and he is completely inadequate: where he can only threaten with his finger, he hits like a sparrow cannon, he concluded Sergey Purasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side-events, and the worst of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very well and fast, the second is often the only thing that you can buy is the symptoms, the whole hope of the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the start of intoxication of the body - temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there's the respiratory symptoms: the difficulty of breathing, the anxieties in the throat, the cough.
Pains on the right or on the left, abdominal pains can also indicate an emerging problem.
In the meantime, Russia can begin to immunize a 12 to 18-year-old generation by the end of the year.
The virusologist, the head of the IFTA genomic engineering lab, Pavel Wolckov, noted that this category is highly affected by coves.
Young people who go to school have as many contacts as possible.
This is the most active segment, as are the children of kindergartens, said "Moscow 24" by Pavel Volkoff, a virologist, head of the IFTY genomic engineering lab.
The author's greatest thanks for this article.
I'd love to refresh my memory.
Teath-In.
In those far-fifty-80s, no dance scene was without the tunes of this group.
And at home, when they were going out with their friends, they danced under their music.
Immunologists hypothetized why obese people are victims of a cove.
The authors of the work examined the fat tissue left behind by bariatric surgery, and found that the fat cells known as adiposes could become coronavirus.
Immune cells in the fatty tissue, macrophages, have also been infected, with strong inflammatory reactions.
Scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who had died of the covet, and found particles of coronavirus in the fat surrounding the various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can hide in the fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid a response to the immune system.
It's probably possible to do that, too, SARS-Cov-2.
Biologist explained the causes of dementia
A bioscientific candidate, Simeon Holoshakin, described the causes of dementia and how it was prevented in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, over 55 million people are affected by the disease.
The Syndrome manifests a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time it is hard to navigate even in a familiar environment.
Holoshakin noted that neurogeneative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins are the most common causes of dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, social exclusion and lack of active cognitive activity can play a role,” he said.
Dementia is also affected by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and low-moving lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, the inability to concentrate and the loss of abstract thinking.
“There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor,” added the biologist.
To prevent the outbreak of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of fistry, cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the FGAW RINIMU.
N.I. Pierogova, head of the Department of Cognitive Infractions of the Federal Centre for the Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Boholepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned some 30,000 illegal artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return some 30,000 artefacts that have been smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, 11 December, Al Hayat was aired by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdul Gouad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has recovered 29,300 artifacts.
Only this year, the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., discovered 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization," he said.
Abdel Gauad specified that all artifacts smuggled out of the country were registered in the archives.
The Department is currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, professionals “trace global auctions and Internet sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social media.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural property was restored to museums upon return.
He said that one of the recovered artifacts was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the veiled bench of Pharaoh Tutanhamon at the London auction.
On July 4, the Christian's Auktion House held tenders that sold over 3,000-year-old brass for $5.97 million (about 680 million roubles).
This led to Egypt’s dissatisfaction.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally taken out of the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanchamon, represented by the sun god Amon, had been kept in a private collection and had not been tendered since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of illegal antiquities from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the smuggling of antiquities is the result of archaeological research by black diggers.
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and that's right, because Crimean Tatars (232,000) are independent people (near the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people - so many Tartars live in Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of that people is two words!
Only the Turkic language group combines them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal staff mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires his employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The reason is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not hand out to its employees corporate telecommunications devices, but instead offers a discount for the purchase of a mobile phone or a smartphone from a telecommunications partner.
Under current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to deal with business matters with colleagues or clients.
The bank exercises the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if the staff member used it to meet a client that was not approved by the Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have moved to a remote mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all the devices that have been used to deal with the working issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline for staff to learn about the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Esenin's life - the 1925th - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the Earth's poet's existence and his "ego."
He's already out of any literary association, he's broken up with imaginism, he's on his own, but he's known for being, he's used, at times he's a strong critic, even angry, but the reader is ready to wear it on his hands.
Over 60 poems have been written in a year, many of them masterpieces, the "Personal Motives" round, the "Anna Sneaghin" poem, the 8 books, the "Ring of the Soviets" book.
And the main success is that at the end of June 25, the State had concluded a treaty with Jesenin to publish his essays in volumes 3.
None of the modern-day Sergey Alexandrovich poets have had such a privilege, he's the first!
In addition, it was very good money - the contract fee was 1,000 roubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 roubles per month, the engineer 200).
The money that year was needed more than ever.
Jesenin married the granddaughter of Tolstoy Sofié Tolstoy, who had to set up a family home, support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
It looks like life's been built up, there's something to be happy about, but for him, it's mostly colored in the dark, like a Black Man nightmare, written in November 1925, and published after Jesenin's death:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very ill.
I don't know where that pain came from.
Is the wind fluttering?
Over an empty and deserted field,
Like a grove in September,
It's brainwashing alcohol.
A lot of friends said that Jesenin had given up a lot, didn't look well, was clearly ill.
There's a lot of revelries, nerve breaks.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was put to Sergei Alexandrovich by anyone, there were no valid documents left.
Let's say, in May 1923, when Jesenin, at the insistence of her fourth wife, the Americans Icedore Duncan was in a hospital in Paris with Professor Peter Gunnushkin (again Hesenin will come back to him two years later, already in Moscow).
And here's the evidence of the poet's singing, the scandals on the ground, the police's getting a lot of stuff - dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 20s, a terrible novel of a poet with a green serpent was rapidly developing.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Jesenin settled for a short time with a friend, the imaginist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Jesenin, with his very good income, never had his home either in Moscow or in Peter, found him in rented apartments, in hotels, or in acquaintances.
The elders remember:
"I only came to sleep at night, and in most cases in a crazy, drunk state.
One day, returning at 4 a.m., Jesenin fell on the stairwell...
He fell, scratched his face and snore.
When he regained a bit, he coughed up, spattering all the sheets with blood."
And Jesenin himself, after traveling to Europe and the United States (the US was then a dry law, but Duncan brought with her a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I didn't see anything but the courgettes and the streets...
I'm at the end of the day, and people don't remember...
Well, I drank, of course...
And I drank because I was bored."

Promtex-Orient 100x195 Duet Latex Econom 100x195
The "Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom" is a modern performance of the budget model in the premium-class ruler.
The base of the mattress is the block of the independent double springs of Duet.
A softer spring of small size is inserted inside the big spring.
This allows the load to be evenly distributed to the mattress.
On both sides the mattress is filled with artificial latex.
It's the analogy of natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibilities and persuasiveness of this material increase the comforting effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it doesn't absorb water and dust.
The mattress will be perfect for a couple with a big weight difference (30 kg).
With the smart springs, there's no wave effect when the lighter partner rolls on the side of the heavy.
A nice, soft-fashioned cover from the practical Jacqueline Sense is covered with a synthepon layer.
Natural tissue does not accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to make this model of mattress in a twisted form (vacuum roll).

He's a lot more responsible than I was in his age, or my husband, who had a problem with the law from time to time before the wedding.
A father takes care of his young daughter.
And he likes, as the Lermonts wrote, "wrong love."
Why did the girl cry at the exam before she failed?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't school?
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
He will.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as a “arms” against the EU
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms”
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Jablonski, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as a “arms” against the European Union and intended to return to such a “operation” next year.
In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement to the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
According to Jablonski, the sanctions against Belarus “stopped Lukashenko temporarily,” but he “is actively seeking new ways”.
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As Kp.ru wrote, the European Union had previously put in place a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It addressed 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they expressed their willingness to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic “unless the situation in the country improves”.
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by Senka's hat," when a velvet jacket makes a man a joke
The world's events in 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first person to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
As early as September, at the premiere of "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet robin jacket and a traditional Bondian butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first put on the Eco-Price award of the Earthshot Prize, which was inconsistent with the royal dressing code, a green velvet jacket, and then selected a more classic version for the Royal Variety philanthropy event.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend applied to itself and Lionel the Messiah.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same clothes.
AliExpress has already noted a growing demand for men's velvet jackets in Russia.
According to analytics at Gaceta.Ru, they started to buy 1.4 times more.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with silhouettes and silhouettes, the main colors are dark beige, Bordeaux, dark blue, and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between 3,000 and 6,000 roubles, and men prefer to buy only jackets - suits of velvet suits they choose less.
It's not just online truthers who can buy them.
The budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the suite segment, the velvet jackets for this season are represented in almost all brands - and Briony, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which it was released to the premiere of the film "Gucci House" by the massador of the brand of Jared Letto.
By choosing the jackets of expensive stamps, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
A special thread binding technology produces a dense fabric with a porous external texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but are therefore less.
Mode expert Lamoda Ilya Vahoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, it is not his model or phase, but his relevance.
"Barhat requires evening light, so a jacket like that is perfect if you're going to a party or a solemn event," Wahoshkin explains. "It's a good thing if the invitation contains the "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion that allows for the choice of a velvet jacket is the status of the buyer.
"The man in the velvet jacket, first of all, has to have the right advanced party with plenty, "the Telegram-Canal of the Man's Beauty Brammell." "The owner of the velvet jackets is usually a caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They're just invited to side-events, where the dress code is always shown.
Ilya Wahoshkin proposes to combine a velvet jacket with the same outfits: classic pants with arrows, one-tone shirts, silk ties, cliffs with brushes, butts.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
The fashionable experts in Brambell's Beauty believe that it would be inappropriate to have a private employee in a velvet jacket at the company, but if it is a "man of the bosses who run the event, it's a "yes," it's a thing of the subject.
If an employee is lower in rank, and his aim is to move up in the complex hierarchy of the company, or to beat up the financial bonuses, it is best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The guide will certainly appreciate the phrase "not by Senka's hat," the editors of Telegram Channel about men's fashion.
There's a very mixed sense of voice.
It's an unnatural tembrae, it's so tedious.
And it's completely not associated with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart, good luck in life!
It's all about money. Alternate energy is good at lobbying, that is, paying.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they grieved?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy was also out of line - gas, oil, and coal were less expensive than they are now.
There's a wild demand for fuel.
The penny's dripping.
Then who's out there?
As usual, a private buyer.
Do Indian problems touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be regarded as idiots who have “defaulted” the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good payday.
I didn't see any pretty people in the picture in the article.
It's just mediocrity within the average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so confident of their beauty that they choose to show it to the whole car, they'll probably not fit it.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautifuls" but not because of their looks.

The immunologist said that re-accination in four to five months would help to protect himself from the strain of the coronavirus "omicron "
Revacation in four to five months can protect the new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron."
This statement was made by the immunologist Nikolai Kruchkov, who called the vaccination six months later, given the new strain, “a very long period”
“In previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to do the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four,” the expert said, while calling for a vaccination campaign, to re-evaluate.
Hookkov also noted that early re-accination provides good antibodies to neutralize.
"If a person has been immunized by two shots and a bouster, or is sick and vaccinated, or vaccinated and sick, he has received a "hybrid immunity," i.e. antibodies of a lot of antibodies, and neutralizes enough," the expert clarified.
The G-7 alerted Russia to “small-scale consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G-7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States) issued a statement following the meeting of the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's “war aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and cost a lot” in Moscow, but the specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,” states the statement.
The Ministers further call on Russia to “demonstrate the escalation, use diplomatic channels, and abide by its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities,” as US President Biden spoke of during a video call to President Putin of the Russian Federation on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandian format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the G-7 also state.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in return,” they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome the abstinence of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” the statement also states.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, said that Russia would suffer “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting had shown “the single voice of the G-7 countries, which accounted for 50 per cent of global GDP, and which had made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia.”
The Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective from the omicron-stamp.
The impact of the vaccine against the Omicron-Stam Coronauvirus is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
This is the conclusion that scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong have reached, and they are transmitting the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective on the basis of a study of anti-virus activity in citizens who had received two doses of COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of anti-virus activity against the original version of Sars-Cov-2, but that capacity was significantly reduced against omicron-species," said Professor Malick Peerys.
In doing so, scientists stressed that vaccines remain the most reliable way to protect against the severe current of the disease by contaminating the coronavirus.
In the past, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted the development of the Coronavirus Pandemic in view of the impact of the Omicron-Tamma.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron-stam could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if no further action was taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine accused the Federal Republic of Germany of blocking the flow of NATO weapons to Kyiv
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Resnikov, accused the Government of former Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition by Kyiv of lethal weapons within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Resnikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and rifles to kill drones.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened its position on the rifles by recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kyiv intends to pursue the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
These include the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
The FT notes, however, that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the view that Kyiv should not expect Berlin to deliver arms to the Chancellor of Scholz.
According to him, the previous German leadership had attributed its refusal to provide weapons to the risk of the military escalation of the conflict in Donbassa despite the “occupation by Russia” of a part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "unlogical" position, I'm sure the diplomat will keep Germany at the new chancellor.
In August, the Ukrainian leader, Vladimir Zelenski, said that Kyiv was waiting for help from Berlin to equip the Navy.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected “to be a technical partner of Ukraine”, added the President.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, Robert Habek, co-chairman of the Green Party, had visited the Republic, where he had advocated the sale of defence weapons to Kyiv.

Mercedes protested against the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi
The German team "Mercedes", whose pilot Lewis Hamilton at the Abed Daby Grand Prix finished second after Red Bull's driver, Max Ferstoppen, protested the final result of the race, reports the press service "Formula-1."
Mercedes considers that the rules of Formula One 48.12 and 48.8 were violated during the race.
In the first case, the German team contests the decision of the judges to return to round riders in the same circle as the leaders.
According to the second, Ferstoppen beat Hamilton to the "restart" zone.
Let's add that now the result of the Grand Prix Abu Dhabi, according to which Ferstoppen beat Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the Formula One World Cup, is preliminary when the Mercedes protests are not known.
G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine
The G7 Foreign Ministers warned of the “serious consequences” for Russia if it continued its military aggression against Ukraine, as stated in the final statement of the parties.
The meeting also noted that it condemned the upsurge of Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
“There should be no doubt in Russia that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs,” states a statement published on the British Government's website.
The G7 Ministers and the EU High Representative noted that “one in their condemnation of Russian armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine”.
The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Elizabeth Trass, at a press conference in Liverpool, warned of the “greater consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to give up its aggression against Ukraine,” she said (the TASS quote).
Earlier, at the Liverpool summit, the G7 Foreign Ministers agreed that the parties must return to the negotiating table to resolve the crisis because of the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.
It was a “Norman-style” negotiation.
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke for the dialogue on Ukraine in the “Norman-style”.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Maria Zecharova, said that, in calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries had “prescribed themselves unable to take responsibility for their own mistakes”.

Ways of recovering the money stolen from the Internet
There are a number of ways to get back the money that was stolen online and not be the victim of fraud in the future.
They were discovered by information security experts in an interview with the RBC.
For example, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when bank card data are in the hands of intruders, it is recommended to keep the assets on the map or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Part of the savings can be set aside to the savings account and withdrawn as required.
The experts also recommend that a separate card be set up for online purchases.
If the money was stolen from shops that do not use 3D Security security, you can start a return procedure.
“In the framework of the rules established by the payment systems for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Security, the responsibility rests with the participant in the calculation chain who does not use the service,” the representative of the Prom Linked Bank clarified.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecompay, Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer had the right to file an application with the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used a map on online resources that do not require two-factor authorizations, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that, in some cases, the Internet shops themselves return the funds to the client if the order has not yet been delivered.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, the Director of the League of Secure Internet, Catherine Mizulin, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud, from the sale of forged documents to the the theft of personal data, had been received.
She said that a single window for online fraud complaints might be an effective solution in the current circumstances.
Scholz has come to Poland to discuss “Norther Flow 2” and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had come to Warsaw to discuss the crisis with migrants at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops at the borders of Ukraine, and the situation with the Russian North Flow-2 pipeline.
Although Scholz had expressed his desire to maintain a good relationship between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries had expressed clear expectations from one another.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateuss Moravecki, said that he would call on Sholtz to oppose the North Flow-2, which is intended to bring Russian gas to Germany bypass Ukraine.
According to Moravecski, Russia can use a gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, for its part, supported Poland ' s efforts to halt the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the disagreement.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party, Law and Justice, violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its High Court held that national legislation had priority over EU regulations.
The new German government, which was sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not make a public commitment to halt the work of North Flow 2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials said to the Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a high-level U.S. congressman announced on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed by the representatives of the G-7 on Sunday.

The MNC wants to give the writers residences.
The future Russian Literary Support Fund will be handed over by the State to the federal property that is left to be inherited from the Union of USSR Writers and the USSR Literary Foundation.
It will set up a writer's residence and inform the Parliament's newspaper in Mincifra, which will be the founder of the fund.
The Ministry of the Interior is preparing a draft presidential decree on the establishment of the Russian Literary Support Fund.
The Explanatory Note specifies that the Fund will be entrusted with the task of providing, inter alia, for the purposeful use and preservation of the buildings and buildings once owned by the Soviet Union of Writers and the Lit Fund.
“In the Russian Federation a significant number of real property properties formerly owned by the USSR Literary Foundation, including those located in the town of the writers of Transdellino, the town of Komarovo of Leningrad oblast, and others,” reported the Parliamentary Gazette in the Mincifra Press Service.
The draft decree prescribes that the statute of the Fund “will be established to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of the literators”.
“The creation of “creating conditions for creative activity” means the creation, on the basis of transferable property in different regions of Russia, of written residences that would be comfortable for creativity,” explained in the Ministry of the Interior our publication.

Doctors warned of the risk of long-term use of hemorrhaging after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartsev and Sergei Tokarev warned of the risk of uncontrollable use of blood-reducing drugs after having a coronavirus infection of COVID-19 and before being immunized against coronavirus.

According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe in questionable advice on the Internet and begin to self-medicate.
There are citizens who, by their decision, begin to take anticoagulants a week before the vaccination.
And in the pre-screening before the inoculation, the doctors see bruises.
He stressed that it was extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The money we find in the church wall is gonna pay $20,000 to the plumbers.
The plumber who found the money in the church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will pay the award.
This is reported in a press release by a non-profit organization, Crime Stoppers of Hoston.
The incident took place in the main evangelical Church of Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that godly Christians will be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, a plumber, Justin Caughley, renovated one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and cheques in heat.
He gave it to the church, and he said he didn't even get any thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We know what you did and what you could do," quotes KPRC-TV.
Apparently, the find is linked to the theft that took place at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
At the time, about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques that were kept in the church's safe was lost.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any loss.
However, a reward of $25,000 was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Caughley could not claim that amount, as the award had expired.
In spite of this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had in time made an award of $5,000 and later received an additional $20,000 in a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's integrity.
He'll get $20,000.
It was previously reported that the police had interrogated Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the Lakewood wall.
Tanya, her speech, her actions, that's her characterization of "like a real man."
That's why the attitude is so negative.
And it's not that "she's financially much richer than all the writers," as they write.

China has a new case of human infection with avian flu virus
A new case of human infection with the avian flu virus of H5N6 is found in China.
The radio station RTHK reported this with a reference to the Hong Kong health authorities' notification, and sent it to the TASS.
Infected by a 68-year-old resident of the town of Huayzhou in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept a pet farm.
His condition is considered critical by the medical community.
The world's first H5N6 virus infestation was reported in May 2014 in the south-west province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases has reached 53 in the country.
In Brazil, citizens were obliged to submit vaccinations on entry
In Brazil, Judge Luis Roberto Barros of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) ordered the entry of a covid-passer.
CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens who have anti-vaccination qualifications are exempt from the production of a vaccination certificate.
The list of exceptions also includes those who have come from countries where the lack of a vaccine has been proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, Pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in the flow of turf,” observed Barroza.
In the past, the Brazilian authorities had ordered unfeeling coronavirus-infected tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
Full protection scheme for COVID-19 is open
A virologist, a doctor of medical science, and a well-deserved Russian scientist, Anatoly Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
This, he said, can be achieved by injecting and using a solo vaccine.
In the case of internal use, a large quantity of immunoglobulin A is produced. In the case of the introduction of a vaccine, this is not the case.
Immunoglobulins A protect the muscular, so the virus can't penetrate the body.
Inside, we have the most immunoglobine G (antital).
And if you inject both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's no solution to the double vaccine, "the medic said.
The Chief Prophylaxis of the URFO, Dr. Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of the use of solo vaccinations in conjunction with the injection is the ability to stop being the host of COVID-19.
He added that this would help to ensure that, in that case, the protection of the body was supposed to be maximum.
Previously, the Minister of Health of the Nedgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that a new upsurge of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
He said that that was the case in other countries, where another wave of pandemics had arrived earlier.
Inna, uh...
I've been talking to the doll (dead a long time ago) like this - if you're ready to switch a warm home, a feed, a pet, a love, and a game for a real bitch, then go ahead.

I've been slowing down a lot of hosts to keep the dog out of the way, even though they've got to get out there, 200 grand running away, right by the hand, and taking it the other way.
So the "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog that ran out there.
In Europe, the mass protest of the opponents of the vaccines continues
More than 40,000 protesters entered the streets in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make the vaccination against the cove compulsory.
As of February next year, unfavorable people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euro.
The Spaniards, indignant at the health policy of the authorities, marched peacefully in Madrid.
Some had posters in their hands that said, "This is a false pandemic," "I'm not going to vaccinate."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, the covet-certificate is compulsory for access to bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, nursing homes and night entertainment.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports had been taken by the authorities in a number of regions of the country against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then it turned into clashes with the security guards.
A group of protesters started throwing stones at the police.
Law enforcement officials responded by using water wells.

WHO has found “omicron” in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that a new strain of coronavirus “omicron” had already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain can have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in a WHO report.
According to the organization, as at 9 December, 63 countries had been identified as strains in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has only become active since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new version of the coronavirus.
WHO experts fear that the new strain may be bypassed by the extent of the spread of the “delta” strains, the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now in the lead in all countries, without exception.
Prior to that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tederos Adhanom Gebreyesus, said that the omicron-stam had the potential to have a significant impact on the progress of the Coronavirus pandemic.
A similar conclusion was reached in the United Kingdom.
The experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the "omicron" will replace the "dellt" in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is because the official “omicrone” in the Kingdom is currently suffering from several hundred people, with an estimate of up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the amicron strain, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals every day at the peak.
What the British health system will not be able to deal with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
The way the Russian "Satellite V" reacts to the "omicron" is not yet known; it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaley Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the amicron strain.

Israel's Prime Minister Bennet reported on the start of vaccinations in schools
The Israeli Ministry of Health has been launching an emergency programme to increase vaccination since Sunday.
In the morning of December 12, Coronairus was immunized in schools all over Israel.
The Prime Minister of the Jewish State, Naftali Bennet, at this meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers, said that the issue of the vaccination of a fourth dose of citizens at risk would also be examined.
In Israel, the massive vaccination of the population against coronavirus COVID-19 began on December 20, 2020.
The Israelis are injected with Pfizer.
As of January 10, last year, the immunized began to receive a second dose.
Vaccination of 12-15-year-olds in the country began in early June this year.
Today, more than 5.78 million people have received both doses of vaccination, and the third is more than 4.12 million citizens.

In Brazil, seven people lost their lives as a result of the storm
At least seven people lost their lives and 175 suffered from heavy storms that struck the north-east state of Bahia and its neighbour, Minas Gerais.
This is reported to the TASS with reference to the rescue services.
At the border of these states, an extra-tropical cyclone has been raging since mid-week, bringing the region to a level of 450 mm. 25 municipalities in the state of Bahia have declared a state of emergency, some of which have become the most devastating flooding in 35 years.
A number of bridges, two river dams, have been destroyed, and three tracks have been blocked.
According to the rescue team, some 5,700 people had been left homeless, and another 6,700 had been forced to flee their homes.
More than 85,000 people in the region were affected by the damage.

$135 billion went to apps - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user costs in applications worldwide increased by 25 per cent, while downloads increased by 8 per cent.
The world's most popular were the various video services.
The most downloaded video editor was CapCut, and most spent on YouTube.
Both the number of downloads and user costs of the applications showed a significant increase between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8 per cent to 140 billion. The cost of applications increased by 25 per cent, to record $135 billion.
This data was published by App Annie, an analytical company, which submitted a report on the market for mobile applications in 2021.
In 2021, the world economy broke out of the lounge and began a post-pandemic recovery.
“Does such a “return to physical” slow the growth of the application economy? None,” the authors of the report consider.
India is the leader of the downloads, accounting for about 20 per cent of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets continued to spend more than users of Android: iOS accounted for 65% of the total cost in the applications.
The video editor CapCut was the top downloader in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps: the MX TakaTak video service and the Mesho online trade app.
Telegram is also included in the top 10 downloads.
In general, according to the number of downloads, VPNs (two in top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and the services associated with the production and broadcasting of videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, two in top 10 - Moj and SnackVideo).
"Most users have spent on live and online spotting applications," notes the report.
This is the site of YouTube, and the top five user costs also include the TikTok video service, Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as the Japanese Piccoma Manga Subscription Service.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom, and TikTok are the first users to be active on a monthly basis.
In Russia, AliExpress's shopping application was the leader in the number of downloads per year.
It is followed by Zenly's service, which shows the location of the friends, and still the same CapCut.
The top 10 applications also include: StarMaker's online caraoke, Shein's online dress striker, the Maps for Minecraft PE application, the online taxi service DiDI, a client for YouTube Pure Tuber, the Dixie Riteller application, and the Samoan online store.
Throughout the world, people have adapted to the pandemic by moving to a life in a mobile, which is one of the main conclusions.
The most successful industries have been those that have helped people to get closer, both virtually and in person,” commenting on the report by the head of the App Annie Marketing Research Department, Lexi Sidow.
The profit of the mobile game sector in 2021 reached $90 billion. The number of downloads was cosual and hyperfaceous, with little or no plot, and the video was minimal.
Top 3 of the world's most popular games included Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls, and Phone Case DYY are leading the games.
==Prognosis==App Annie had previously presented its 2022 prognosis.
Among the main trends of the following year, the company's analysts called the rise in the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the increase in popularity in the Z-generation of financial applications, such as the Robinhood Investors' Apps, and the further increase in the popularity of metaversive mobile games.

The Russians have been warned of a new scheme of fraud
The intruders began to look for new manoeuvres for fraud in video messages.
It's written by "The News" with a reference to experts.
According to the Director of Products of Ivideon Zaura Aboulimov, the main danger associated with the distribution of videos is the dope.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on actual records of the victim.
As a result, neurosetics are able to accurately reproduce the specificities of a person’s behavior.
Aboulimov added that by using the dolphin, intruders can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video of a copy of a person for the purpose of blackmail.
“Those forgerys can easily trigger a bulling, as a backed-up intruder can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudoscenarios,” the expert said.
Chief System Engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video technologies.
David, add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that all of this was bought in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow you to wear too much paint and walk in short skirts, and to show your stockings and panties on your legs.

Five actions are listed that will help to avoid diabetes mellitus
The problem with blood sugar is one of the most common in the world.
Some, however, do not attach much importance to this, and it is not.
Sugar diabetes can lead to severe complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a key role in preventing the generation of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend a change in the drinking regime - a reduction in the number of different drinks and a shift to regular water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods increase the level of blood sugar to a dangerous level when over-used.
So the first step on the road to a healthy way of life is to stop buying candy and keep it at home.
It is not only a bad diet but also a habit that affects the incidence of the disease.
To reduce the risk of diabetes mellitus, we need to move a lot.
Experts advise you to keep low-carbon diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce the weight, but will also help to protect against abrupt fluctuations in the level of sugar.
You need to eat a lot of cellular to protect yourself from diabetes.
The food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to a sense of sobering up, dispersal of digestive juices, and increased food use.

Dr. Pavlova told me about the "little-day migraine" at the workaholics.
A number of factors can lead to a deterioration of health on weekends
The reason for the deterioration in health after workdays is often the “migranity of the day off”, explained by a well-known endocrinologist, a doctor in medical science, a senior researcher at the Faculty of Basic Medicine of the MGU, and a researcher at the Zuhra Pavlov Hospital of Systemic Medicine in his telegramme.
She said that it was particularly common for workaholics to suffer from headaches, breakage, and weakness during the weekend.
Dr. Pavlova pointed out that, in addition to a week’s accumulated fatigue, there are quite a number of objective reasons for the body’s negative reaction to changing conditions.
Our lives change radically this weekend.
"We sleep long, we stay on the couch all day, we probably eat more, and we drink less," the doctor reasoned.
Because of overeating and lack of water, it's heavy and broken."
An additional role is the late upturn.
So if you get up three hours later than normal, you get a reaction called the jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factor is critical to the deterioration of health, Pavlova recommended that we observe that the most important change is during the weekend.

South African scientists have said that Pfizer's vaccine against the "omicron" is not very effective.
In South Africa, Pfizer's vaccine against the "omicron" was said to be under-efficiencies.
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported that Pfizer's vaccine against the omicron-stamp of coronavirus infection was low.
It is estimated to be 22.5 per cent effective against infection with symptoms, which ... questions the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, according to a study published on the MedRxiv Portal.
In addition, experts have clarified that the drug can save the disease from a severe current.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the omicron-stam of the coronavirus might cause a new wave of pandemics in the United Kingdom with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars are there in common foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutritious nutrients.
Its excess in diet can lead to Type 2 diabetes, as well as to cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should bear in mind that an unknown word in the product may indicate a hidden sugar, an ingredient similar to that of the calorie, composition and glycemic index.
Several dozen names, in fact sugar, can be represented on the label.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fruit.
There may also be other dried sugars, such as dextrose (sugar from maize), left-handed (fruit sugar), melassa (black stream), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that are mono- and dysaharims, and they can be not only in pastry, but also in ketchup, doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and to the many different names of sugar.
The different kinds of sugars are different in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the product is - syrup or nectar, treated or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is not only the amount of sugar specified by the producer on the package, but also that vegetables, fruit, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be much higher than the label.
German chancellor Scholz: gas will be lost to the Germans in 25 years.
The new German chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the import of gas was losing importance to Germany, as the country continued to decarbonize the economy.
He said that Germany was planning to completely phase out gas, oil, and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years, the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to the Federal Republic of Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to the transport of Russian natural gas by Ukraine in the future, as this resource is now important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement expressing Berlin’s support for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Previously, the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annalena Berbock, stated that the process of certification of the North Flow 2 gas pipeline was ongoing.
According to the Minister, in the context of the coalition negotiations and the negotiation of the coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The Diplomat also indicated that the pipeline is “not in line” with the EU's requirements.

The hackers hacked the Prime Minister of India's Twitter
The hackers hacked the Indian Prime Minister's Twitter account, Narendra Modi.
The intruders have been able to post a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal means of payment, and that it had already purchased the cryptovalite.
Modi's office has been asked to ignore new messages.
The premier said that on Twitter, a quick reaction - access to the account was restored.
India's premiere's page was already hacked in 2020 and was encouraged to make donations to the fund by means of a cryptovalut.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in the third ballot was considerably lower than in the previous two.
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51 per cent (2,755 persons) of New Caledonia voted in favour of the independence of France, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians taking part in the elections.
As France-Presse commented, “the origin of these elections left no room for doubt,” as the supporters of independence called on voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed the holding of the referendum on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago was preventing a full and “honest” campaign.
This non-participation has thus paved the way for the third victory of French New Caledonian supporters, following the referenda held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, and 53.3 per cent in 2020.
According to the separatists, they do not accept the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
On Sunday, 12 December, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, was told to speak at the Elysée Palace on the basis of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has greatly revived the recent presidential campaign in France.
A number of presidential candidates have expressed their preference for the Territory to remain in France, as it is “the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean”.
“New Caledonia must always remain French,” Eric Zemmour repeated.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valery Pecress, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, encouraging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it's not his responsibility”.
Nevertheless, the President added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia”.
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “the strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be France's choice”.

In Turkey, the world's first laser-armed drone was tested
Turkey has successfully tested the world's first laser-armed drone.
"Eren" was tested at a distance of between 100 and 500 m, according to the MIR24.
The machine is able to neutralize explosive objects at a distance by means of a laser.
The maximum flight height is 3000 m.
After the relevant tests, the UAVs must enlist the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without the use of deminers.
The Agency stresses that Turkey is among the six countries in the world that are able to develop and produce their own drones.

WSJ readers critical of Russia's and US relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article, in which he described his vision of Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrificed Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and allowed a series of insulting remarks to be made against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell called on the Western countries to “join a united front against Russia”.
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There's a lot of false information in this article," the RIA News quotes from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to lose it, and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine,” said another.

An earthquake of 5.2 magnitude occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred near the Kuri Island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicentre of the earthquake was 231.8 km north-east of the city of North Kurilsk.
The area was 92.5 km in depth.
Previously, seismologists observed an earthquake of 7,5 in Peru, in which 10 people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new-generation jet drones.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish factory, a type ANKA-type UAVs will be launched.
On 11 December, a freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President, Alexei Arrestovic, reported this.
So they're capable of acting against air objects, against other drones.
Even against airborne pilots.
They'll have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish Airlines: the hull and so on,” quotes the Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA, the arrester said that it was a jet, not a piston drone.
He said it's a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which outnumbers it "in all respects."
The first batch of UAVs was to be produced by the factory at the end of the following year, and he concluded the arrest.
The ANKA aircraft was set up by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the day, the Ukrainian General Staff secreted data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin rockets in the military operations of the combined forces in Donbassa.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, reported that a modern military drone factory had begun to be built.
He said that Ukraine intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Defence Department entered into an agreement to construct a centre in Kyiv oblast to train personnel, as well as to test and service Turkish Bayraktar drones.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called the memorandum a "more real step forward."
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport.
At the Singapore airport, Changi escaped the lions.
This is reported by The Streets Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions coming on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they went.
One of the runaway lions lay on the roof of the container.
The beasts could not move away from it because of a nearby protective net.
The opposition ended with the arrival at the airport of Mandai Wildlife Group, which runs all the Singapore zoos.
They have demobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and are planning to take them to the Quarantine.
It was previously reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion had fled the landlord and had been walking the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and no harm was done to the people.
Experts warned of the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research shows that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people without folic acid deficiency are less likely to suffer from some types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
In contrast, however, overdoses contribute to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietologist Beth Kitchin, advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if it is significantly diverged from this figure in a larger or smaller way.
Kitchin recommends that vitamin B9 should not be taken in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, that dosage should be monitored and that milk and other foods that contain folic acid should be avoided.
Previously, a food consultant, Rachel Feyn, called folic acid a substance that slows ageing.
Since it is, among other things, held in avocados, Fein recommended that men, after 50 years of age, eat the fruit more frequently.
In the United Kingdom, about 75,000 people could die by April.
Forecasts by British scientists indicate that the proliferation of the omicron-stam coronavirus may cause up to 75,000 deaths in England in the next five months, unless restrictive measures are tightened in winter.
The Guardian, referring to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reported this to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast by the British Cabinet's Scientific and Resource Group on Emergencies, by April 2022 the country would have recorded at least 25,000 deaths due to the omicron strain, with a total hospitalization of some 175,000 patients.
At the height of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 people per day.
“Serious measures to control the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from overburdening if the omicron-stam is more contagious than the delta option, and the current vaccines will not be able to prevent the infection,” said the mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
The British Health Safety Agency had previously reported that, if the current rate of omicron-stamp distribution continued, about 1 million cases would be detected by the end of the year.
By mid-December, however, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, there are 1,898 cases of omicron-stamp coronavirus infection in the United Kingdom, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
On 9 December, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that, in reality, the figure might already be as high as 10,000.

The demand for super-hulls grew by a quarter in the world.
The construction of superhulls this year, and the orders for next year, have hit all the world's records, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and to combat climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the world registry was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the will and the money for a floating fortress for 50 million pounds or more will not decline, writes the Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25 per cent more vessels were ordered than the previous year.
Brokers say it's been 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear contamination on land and prefer to flee the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If all of these people used to go to the office and meet with their business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and they negotiate in the winter.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that the yards take orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that the customers are willing to pay more so that their yacht is ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just hunt for freedom, and super-rich people can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to realize that in times of space travel, life on boats, or flight on their own planes, the public is irritating, because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
The economists call on governments to act and suggest that new taxes and rules be imposed on super-rich people, although they realize that it will be extremely difficult to implement with this mobility of money.
In the meantime, the number of super-yutes ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Requet is constructing a 180-metre-long REV Ocean yacht.
It's gonna be the biggest yacht in the world.
There is a “summer pool” on the yacht, as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
In the existing super-yahts, it is common for the helicopter, the open-air cinema, and some of them, like the McGregor Boat, to be a platform for unification. Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at the University of the United States of America in Indiana, says that, compared to the total number of greenhouse gas selections, the carbon trace produced by super-rich ones is not significant.
But it's symbolic, given that the multi-billionaires in the world are just over 2,000.
This is just another example of the overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emissions trace of billionaires is thousands of times the trace of the world's average.
While one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the world's largest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the effusion trail cooled down on his yacht, Eclipse, which was 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the crew to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superys don't make other people sympathize when, like the richest Australian woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complains over YouTube that there is no room for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call for the construction of marinas for ships in excess of 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified leading to the development of intestinal cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of cancer.
It's written by the Daily Express.
The experts concluded that the use of four or more drinks a week involved a higher risk of oncology.
However, the risk of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of intestinal cancer than women.
The exact cause of this kind of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, noting that certain factors lead to a process that is harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old
Many, or more precisely, all dog lovers believe that these creatures are very smart.
But even they don't know how advanced four-legged pets are.
Over the years, biologists have been experimenting with different kinds of experiments to be sure of how the brains of animals are developed.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as vast as human, a new study proves that a dog can respond to 89 words or phrases in a consistent way.
The works of scientists were published in Sciencealtert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poems, know nothing about politics, economics, and art, but they often fool their masters.
Some species, experts believe, show better results in understanding human language, but statistics are not yet sufficient for accurate conclusions.
For example, some species are traditionally considered dog geniuses, such as labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and their ability to learn is not less than a two - year - old.

In Ukraine, they're ready to trade in the US and Russia
The United States and Russia will “trade” about Ukraine's entry into NATO, the Analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the Glossaurus.
In his view, Washington and Moscow are about to continue negotiations on United States guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden on the right of countries to “to go anywhere”.
If you're offered something that's known to be unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not gonna trade, you're just gonna send the offerer.
And Ukraine is about to be traded," wrote an analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine, but was seeking a dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparation is conducted secretly, quickly, and immediately to offensive action, rather than waiting for the group to find and deploy the forces of resistance,” he noted.
China promotes the development of the rail transport industry
China's advanced technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Expo, held in Zhuzhou Province of Hunan/Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, noted the representative of How Zhaoven.
High-speed trains on the China-Laos rail line, which was put into service earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will make the rolling stock more reliable and efficient.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased rail exports, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “China's speed”.
In May of this year, the first double-storey power trains developed in China to be exported to Europe from the CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. production line.
At a maximum operating speed of 200 km/h, the trains will travel on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a pilot subway train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began operation.
The train will be moving along the line of the metropolitan link between the centre of Istanbul and the airport of the city.
The subway line will be open next year.
This will be the fastest subway line in Turkey at a rate of 120 kilometers per hour.
“The Chinese Rail Machinery Industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the highest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaoxian, head of the China International Trade Promotion Committee's Department of Commerce and Investment/CEBT/.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's production of high-end equipment on the world market," said Feng Yaosian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, after a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of equipment for rail transport, with a full range of aids and large-scale production.
According to Feng Yaosyan, the country is ranked first in the level of electrification of railways and in the running of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed the early signs of dementia
In an interview with Radio Sputnik, a bioscientific candidate, Semen Holoshakin listed the early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive irregularities, such as the failure to concentrate, to plan, and to reduce abstract thinking.
The current debate is that hearing loss can be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, says the specialist.
Holoshakin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurogeneative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis in the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
Biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know how to treat dementia effectively.
It is therefore necessary to start prevention in time.
He said that foreign language and active communication would help to reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends the maintenance of a moderate level of physical stress, the regular training of cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory engagement and thinking logic
“There are recommendations for the application of the various BADs, but their effectiveness and utility are still being discussed in the scientific community,” said Holoshakin.
“The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of a moderate level of physical stress, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and reasoning,” said Holoshakin.
Previously, the British Dementia Foundation stated that the disease is becoming more common among people over the age of 40.
The early symptoms of Alzheimer's have been reported by the medics.
The first warning sign is visual problems, which make it difficult for a patient to detect objects.
Another sign of developing dementia was the aphasia, a state in which a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist ordered Saakashvili to be sent for treatment abroad.
The former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, is in need of psychoactive treatment and rehabilitation abroad, told journalists by the neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of a medical consimilation set up under the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
The problems of movement, coordination, variability of character,” said the specialist, noting that this was not outside the normative framework, and that the ex-president now needed to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, which we did not find possible in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical treatment after he was disciplined by the prison service.
The Georgian policy was quick to lift the penalty and to reinstate itself.

Protests against COVID-passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, there were protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, which is transmitted to Europe Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports became mandatory for bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, nursing homes, and night entertainment.
Many of the protesters have come to the party without masks.
They blamed the State for totalitarianism with slogans on their posters and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required for access to entertainment and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatoria, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus have been detected since the start of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on non-vaccinants.
The bill on the common QR code system was introduced by the Government in the State Duma on 12 November.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit mass event sites, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities, with either a certificate of vaccination or a medical certificate for vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and aircraft.

Smooth rise: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the hills and help to create international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will make it possible for President Xi Jinping to collect 1 trillion yuan, but will also contribute to the economic development of the backward, remote provinces.
The Taiwu Mining resort in Zhangjiakou, not far from the winter Olympics, is becoming more popular among the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening is being carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many parts of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are snow problems.
The main long-term challenge is to provide comfort and fun rest in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, it is far from there.
==History==A consultant for the Games, Justin Downs, said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry had changed to unrecognized.
Every winter more Chinese go to the hills.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many years to create a ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and develop the infrastructure needed for rest.
The 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chungley, not far from the winter Olympics.
He noted that in recent years there had been a boom in winter sporting.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chungley, they set up a high-speed railroad, and now none of the locals suffers from work.
There are more and more stores in the country selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, we open up the food points of the national kitchen.
There's even a test station on COVID-19 in Taiwan.
China is trying to create a flourishing winter sport industry, its athletes must be the leaders of the major international competitions, and resorts and equipment must be at the global level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, said at WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be plunged into extreme poverty because of the Coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed human progress in universal access to health care, has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
On 12 December, the International Day for Universal Health Care, WHO and WB issued two complementary reports.
They found that the pandemic had led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, and had caused excessive stress in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has declined, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic had caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
This situation drives more than 500 million people "to extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the Coronavirus Pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and that more than four billion people had little social support.

The speech of Taiwan's digital minister, Audrey Tan, at the panel discussion during the US-sponsored "Sammit for Democracy" was translated into a video-free mode, attesting to the record of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, with reference to sources, claims that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was distinguished by a colour from the PRC, which considered the island to be its territory.
The map, shown by Miss Tan, was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was identified green as “free” and the PRC, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Laos and Viet Nam as red as “closed”.
After the Minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the views of the discussants “do not necessarily express the position of the US Government”.
The PRC was not invited to the "Sammit for Democracy."
Reuters notes that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister may have run counter to the “one China” policy of Washington.
One of the agency's sources said that the US National Security Council, after displaying the map, had angryly contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan a separate country.
Washington's "Sammit for Democracy" was held from 9 to 10 December with the participation of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and philanthropic organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero-day” summit, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, editor-in-chief of the New Newspaper, Dmitri Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be spent on charity.
Earlier today, the Undersecretary of the Russian Federation, Yuri Averyanov, stated that the summit was “an anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.
You get the info like they're cooking, and there's a dead meat everywhere, and the butcher's got the last piece of meat.

The New Shepard spaceship, with six tourists on board, made a suborbital flight
The New Shepard Blue Origin, with six tourists on board, made a suborbital flight on Saturday, 11 December.
The travel on the company's website lasted a total of more than 10 minutes, after which the passenger capsule went down to Earth, reports the TASS.
The launcher was launched from a launch site in the U.S. state of Van Horn, Texas.
The ship rose to a height of just over 100 kilometers, and space tourists were in a state of impoverishment.
The launch vehicle itself landed stately on the launch site.
Blue Origin successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard with passengers on board on 20 July.

China is strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities with land access points
The joint mechanism for the prevention and control of the State Council of the PRC issued a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in the cities where the land gates are located, with a view to further preventing the import of infections from abroad.
According to the circular, people who leave the cities in question must submit a negative test result for the nucleic acids of COVID-19, which was obtained within 48 hours of departure.
Those who come to the cities where land access points are located must take at least one test for the nucleic acids of COVID-19 upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day when the relevant provincial-level administrative units will identify and publish the zones of the towns in question, up to 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land access points that meet certain conditions may consider establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we heard about the “truthful conclusion” between Russia and the United States.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Ryabkov, in an interview with the News, assessed the prospects for the relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long road of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There's one-sided negative predictability, but there's some prospect of a better relationship that's completely unforeseeable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long road we have travelled with both the current administration and Trump and Obama.
The problem didn't start yesterday,' said the diplomat.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is that the US is trying to impose on Russia a multiplicity of approaches.
The heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that it would not be risky to present optimistic forecasts of prospects for better relations, nor would it expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress had been made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the messages will be heard and that the Americans will heed the arguments of common sense.
Previously, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
The virus warns of the risk of vaccination with a nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
In the case of COVID-19 drug users, they may be allergic and need medical help, so the first points to inoculate this drug should not be arranged at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by the TASS by the virologist, the RAN correspondent member, the Bionanotechnology, Microbiology and Virology of the Novosibirs State University, Sergey Netes.
It's easier to set up vaccination sites at airports and shopping centers, but I'd do it in the first place only in health-care facilities.
The fact is that the risk of allergic reactions to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable that the person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-alergic drugs that work in just a minute or two, which can be very needed,” says Netes.
In the view of the virologist, it would be possible to consider vaccinations at shopping centres when there was experience in the use of the drug.
He also stressed that in using a solo vaccine, it was important that it hit the mucous casing in the bow.
However, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the inoculated nose is shrivelled after injection.

In the United Kingdom, 1,239 cases of infection with the new omicron-stamp coronavirus were detected 24 hours a day.
Sky News informs about this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of "omicron" have been recorded in England, 38 people have been diagnosed with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the United Kingdom was 3,137.
In a pessimistic prediction, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had previously estimated that 75,000 people might die in England by April due to a coronavirus outbreak caused by the "omicron" strain.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries imposing anti-Russian sanctions
The Spokesman for the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of “aggressive action” against Ukraine, including the alleged “prosecution” into the country's territory.
“It is not possible to impose any restrictions on Russia and not to suffer,” the official representative of the Kremlin aired on Radio Russia 1.
Sandov claims it's "all the world understands."

At the same time, the head of the Sberbank, Herman Griff, is convinced that this is not possible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to withdraw from France.
On 12 December, the French channel BFM.TV reported this.
96.5 per cent of those who voted opposed independence.
In the South Pacific, 3.51 per cent of the inhabitants of the archipelago supported independence from France.
The results of the 2.99 per cent ballots were cancelled.
The voting rate was very low on that day, with about 55 per cent of the inhabitants of the archipelago coming to the sites.
According to the experts, the low attendance was due to calls by separatists to withdraw from the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the location of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 km from the mainland of France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia to be its domain.
Some 270,000 people live on the archipelago, and the Territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
The 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration is in force, whereby the region can organize a vote on its independence twice, with a difference of two years.

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that the “omicron” is less dangerous than the delta-stam of the coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of a decline in the effectiveness of vaccines in the new version of COVID-19.
According to information on 9 December, “omicron” was registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly modified antigeneous profile of the "omicron" strain suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the anti-infection vaccine and the transfer of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it (the burden of the disease - Red.) may be less severe than in the case of a “delta”, states a WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of “omicrone” infection in the EU are easy or unsymptomed.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spread faster than the delta.
There are two cases of omicron-stamp infection in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," reported the Gamaley Center.
The head of Rostlyznadzor, Anna Popova, claimed that there was still no reliable evidence that the new version of the coronavirus was less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine, four scripts were named for the
Ex-Deputy of the Supreme Council, Vadim Denisenko, listed four options for developments for the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State could be left without the support of the West, as well as perhaps compromises on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko spoke about it in a publication on the Gloss Portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called “the perfect storm”, suggests that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kyiv may face in 2023.
"The price of key goods that we have traditionally exported is collapsing in parallel ... > internal protests and opposition to key FPGs (financial-industry groups. - Red.) ", added an ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of “war against everyone”.
This prediction will come true in the event of a high level of turbulence in global politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
Because of this state of affairs, the Ukrainian leadership can make compromises on Donbass, which can lead to domestic confrontation.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will be weakened, and the probability of such a situation, according to the former Nardep, is up to 50-55%.
The third option in the Ukrainian policy is to confront dissenting groups of the Green and the President, which is likely to take control of the force bloc and implement “populist initiatives”.
In the course of this scenario of the crisis, Zelenski will begin the “reform of power”, added Denisenko.
Another scenario is to turn Zelenski into a "Father of the Nation."
This may result in an event that will be a major shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to trigger reactions from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine,” Denisenko said.
Such an option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made disaster or a Russian act of aggression.
On the other hand, the Russian side has on more than one occasion rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that are increasing military activity along Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, a survey of the Sociological Group Reiting showed that the ranking of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low of 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest number since his election as Head of State.
Analysts had predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next election of the President of Ukraine for Zelenski, only 21.8 per cent of the votes would have been cast, whereas for the ex-president of the country, Peter Poroshenko, 14.5 per cent.
Of all those interviewed, only 19.3 per cent had expressed support for the President.

Arrested for an action in Red Square by a poet: "A quote from Eutouchenko gives 10 days, that's the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the UCE was arrested in Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poets of the United States was written by a poet.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugenius Eutoshenko.
A protocol had been drawn up for Alexander on the administrative article on the renegotiation of the public action.
He was first arrested on 23 January in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The aim was to draw attention to poetry in general, and now, unfortunately, has lost interest in it, to the decline of the culture common in Russia, and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," Alexander explains.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the arrest and to give more details to his message.
How have you been treated by the police this time and before?
What'd the department ask how you commented on your action?
This time the staff was more accurate, arresting as polite as possible, as funny as it sounded in some context.
At Pushkin, they took the OMONs and took them hard.
Asked standard about motive.
When we heard, in principle, we saw it, if we didn't, it was understandable.
With the exception of the four-way-delivery of the monkey, it was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was going to do.
And if, after the action under this hashtag, they start to write their poems, at least a few people, I'm going to sit for 10 days.

It's protocol and nothing else, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks very well in Russian, and nevertheless resorts to the help of an interpreter.

Researchers explained how potatoes help to control age disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that contribute to improved circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
Roots contain vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, ribophlavin, folic acid, and pantotenic acid.
All of these elements help the system of the organism to function.
In addition, potatoes help to combat age disorders.
Because of the high cell content, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help to prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the most good of all, root is best put out or cooked, not cooked on butter.
Previously, The Daily Express had warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, like other high-glycemic products.
These are products with carbohydrates that quickly split into sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Summersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian canteen potatoes, noting the decline in production in the private sector and the increase in processing capacity.
In the view of the market, the current product deficit will only replace imports.
Lostfilm, longfilm and other pirates will be removed from the Yandex
Nominations for departure
In 2015, the rights holders of the RAAC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate web sites and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazarian, Director of the Institute for Internet Research.
But some -- Kinogo, Lostfield, Filmix -- did survive, including a regular change of domain name, he added.
For example, in the Lostfield, which is available in search of both the Yandex and Google, you can see pirate copies of Netflix's "Squid Game" and "The Tenderness" by the director Anna Melician, the original series of Russia's largest video service, ivi.
You can look at the Encanto animation novel at Kinogo, which is also available in the search engine, but by the quality of the video, it's a so-called screen (a pirate copy of the movie taken in the theater).
On the Filmix, which is also available via search engine, there is a series of "Universe. Ten Years Later" by TNT (entered in Gazprom Media).
Svetlana M., I'm sorry, of course, but I don't care if my son is offended by her mommy or not.

The lamp is the wall of Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
The wide circumference of the "molecules" of the light provides as uniform and bright a light as possible.
“Atomic” or “molekular” design, reflecting the nature and nature of each subject, does not lose its relevance and allows for the sharing of accents in the interior.
One characteristic of such lamps is the weightlessness of the structure.
The thin, almost invisible cables that are adjusted in heights make it feel like the chandelier floats in the air.
The metallic gold fittings and the matt-and-white miniature phonographs will easily add to any palette, and the hinged chandelier and bras in the collection will be the ready ensemble to light the living room, the bedroom, and the hallway.
Well, it tastes like the color it's called.
I really liked the Tarkhun, not the current one, of course.
Very tasty was the sap in the spill from high glass cylinders.
Three drinks of syrup is too much for my taste.
Two were perfect.
Dimax Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient in that it has two softly different surfaces, a high hardness and a little bit more than the average.
The product includes only quality and bonus fillings, which have proved to be of the best value.
Springs: An independent micropackage spring block is placed at the centre of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the bed, which work completely autonomously.
It is their function that provides a unique point-by-point adjustment.
"Micropacket" is the highest-frequency range of the Dimax spring blocks, so it has a strong orthopaedic effect and is considered primal.
Fillers: A combination of the layers of the carpet and natural latex is in place from the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If there's a latex on one surface, the other has a coconut coke.
It's been classical for a long time, because it's not only an orthopedic but also anatomical.
If the coira provides the right back support, the latex will adapt the surface to the human body.
Cologne: The model is presented in the protruding tricottal cover of Aloe Vera.
At the client's request, it can be either filmed or fixed.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended sleeper load is 170 kg.
Safeguards and security: the guarantee period is 3 years.
The mattress received all the necessary certificates and documents to prove its complete safety and security in operation.
The orthopaedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will look for life in Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, and reported on Sunday, "The Accuum".
The purpose of the five-year start-up missions is to assess the fitness of Venus's clouds, and then to look for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
So far, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the nearest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
A sample from Venus should arrive during the third mission.
Let's say that if we find life there, the main question is whether it's Earth-like or different.
If so, it will be evident that life on earth did not begin.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth,” said the head of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Michael Paisal.

Metal universes will change Russia's business
The theme of metavolents became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the major player confirmed the development of a new format for digital interaction between humans.
So business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own metavolents and their subsequent monetization.
The metavolents should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to create remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, as people are tired of divisiveness and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is the result of business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
With the third, they are a logical follow-up to the trend of the digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art, or even money are digitized.
Anya, you're right, changing the diet is an informed process.
When you start eating the right food, you don't want anything too fat or too bad.
Of course, we're going to have some traditional olivier and a herring under my coat, but no one's making me eat everything at once.
You can eat a spoon, try it, and that's it.
After all, it's ten weekends ahead of you, you can make any good and useful dishes.

The British economist failed to make a 2022 prognosis
The British economist Jim O'Neill failed to make a 2022 prognosis, because in his view, such attempts would fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert is of the view that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend may change the course.
The most important factor is the Coronavirus Pandemic, and the second is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the price rise was temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, it was clear before the pandemic that “the world of the endless generosity of central banks has become obsolete” and it is time to return to a relationship where inflation-related interest rates will correlate with the expected rate of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that, in the context of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies may, in the view of some experts, lead to a new upsurge in inflation.
Attention should also be drawn to the issue of productivity growth, as well as to the rise in poverty and climate change, as summarized by O'Neill.
Mikhail Schulgin, the head of Global Studies, Open Investment, had previously reported that the positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remained, with less potential for growth.
Among the risks to the dollar was the Fed’s monetary policy, oil price dynamics, and fears in the context of the Coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is, when you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There's progress, but it's sluggish.
There's a problem: there's a lot of environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
All kinds of ecotaxis that take the waste out of the house.

Russians gave about 4.5% of the country ' s GDP to autodealers
As a result of the 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion roubles to buy new cars, an increase of 28 per cent over the same period last year, as shown by statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPA).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and the economy during the Coronavirus Pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of country of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that that amount was comparable to more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In the Russian market, the Korean brand of Kia is the top of the market.
In the 10 months of this year, he managed to sell 325.7 billion roubles, an increase of almost 24 per cent over the previous year.
The associated Hyundai brand has an even larger growth rate of over 35%, and the profit from the car sales is estimated to be 279.3 billion roubles.
At the top of the line, this brand and by increasing the weighted average price of the car - it rose by almost 21% in Hyundai over a year, to 1.94 million roubles - the most significant travel was for Changan, Chery, Geely, and Mercides-Benz.
However, the sales of Korean brands have not increased so much: according to the statistics of the Auto-Producing Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kya has made 9.4 per cent more cars in the same period than the year before.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota is a three-man-monetary-sale company that has spent 275.5 billion roubles on this brand in 10 months, an increase of 14 per cent over the year before.
The Japanese follow the Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion roubles (+75 per cent) - the German bonus-brand has also increased sales (37 per cent) and the weighted average car price (almost 28 per cent up to 8.2 million roubles).
"Mercedes-Benz has at the same time seen a good growth in sales and a weighted average price - more than BMW - from here on, and a larger increase in financial capacity -" explained the CEO of NAPI Tatiana Arabaji. -
At the rate of growth in sales, fantastic performance is shown by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased the financial capacity this year.
Russia's Lada shows an average of 28% of the market, and 229.4 billion roubles were spent on the brand's cars in 10 months.
At last year's financial capacity, the companies that sold their cars in 2021 fell, including Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Nissan.
The UZA, in the minus, spent 12 billion roubles on SUVs and pickups in 10 months, compared to 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
Against the background of the problems of the supply of motor vehicles and the disruptions in production that have affected the world's roadway, motor companies continue to continuously adjust prices, the same Autowaz increased the cost of the Lada model seven times a year, the last trip (by 8 to 10,000 roubles) occurred at the end of November.
Prices are regularly renegotiated for their products and other automakers.
Russia’s car market will continue to expand in monetary terms - in addition to the shortage of machines, inflation is contributing to it, as well as the drive of car concerts to win back past losses, experts believe.
Given the shortage of cars, I think that a lot of car concerts have even been able to partially transfer to the consumer the costs of past periods, which they have not been able to place at the price of cars before,
Says an analyst at the BTB Capital on the Vladimir Bespalov motorway.
I believe that, in financial terms, automakers are feeling very well right now, maintaining a high margin of marketing."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of motor vehicles, which is observed in 2021, and the price of new machines is rising faster than inflation, the expert explains.
In the long run, the market will grow in both quantitative and monetary terms, but mainly through inflation and the complex design of the machines themselves, foretells the Bespails.
With the increase in supply, the potential for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, Russian authors will continue to grow next year, even if the cost of motor vehicles slows down, automakers will be able to earn their income from the volume, notes the independent consultant for the Car industry, Sergey Burgasliev.
In view of the high demand and undersupply, automakers are now trying to make the most of the money from each car sold, notes the Burgasleys.
No increase in car production is expected in the next six months, and Russia is also aroused by uncertainty about the future.
Against the background of the market situation, cars have proved to be a good place to invest - a car that was bought a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold more than the original cost, the expert notes.
Biden commented on a US military transfer to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion
The U.S. leadership never considered sending the US military to Ukraine in the case of Russia's “execution.”
President Joe Biden of the United States made this statement.
"Never had such plans," said the White House head, answering a journalist's question about whether the US had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalated, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the US and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defence of Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invaded the territory of Ukraine, the US would send forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic).
"We will have to send more American and Natyan troops to the east flank, B9 -- all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, President Dmitry Peskov's Spokesman stressed that Moscow had no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow saw a problem in the military use by Kyiv of Turkish-made drones, as well as in the fact that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
I'm out of this interview right away.

The mattress is perfect for both one person and a couple.
The latter will particularly appreciate the existence of a stable surface and the absence of a "wave" effect, when the swings on the same side of the mattress can be transmitted to the opposite, the anxiety of a person in a dream.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, like a "MVD staff member" or another force structure, it is inefficient to drop it at once, and it is likely that it will not be possible to put it on the black list.
Because in order to prove his lies about his involvement in security structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to frighten and persuasive.
More useful recommendations are needed for the people.
Oh, that's bullshit.
I can't believe it was like that.
They don't know how to figure out who to blame.
The Queen's got here.
And most of all, they think it's everyone's fault, except the most...
It wouldn't be easier to leave people alone from being coerced, of course, if ours cared for their people.
