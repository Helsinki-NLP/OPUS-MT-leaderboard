.Football, basketball, Waleball, Fencing, Rugby, One-sex, Razor, Playboy, Playboy, Player, and Formula One Race are part of the populary sport here.
The most populous nature of winter-style sport is used in the North, with international games and allysics being played by Italians and Italians.
Japan is located on nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is the Island of Hansus, and thanks to this, Japan is occupying the 7th place in the world among the world's most violent islands.
Japan is often called the "archipelago" from the point of viewing geography, because it represents a cluster or a group of Islanders.
Taiwan’s history began 15 years ago, and its name was then recorded by the European Marokes, which had mimicized the term “Farmosa” — meaning “smart island.”
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base on the South-Western Taiwan Territory and initiated reform of basic bakery practices.
The Dinar Tsin (1644-1912), in 1683, captured the Western and North Taiwanese Territory and declared Taiwan to the Tsin Empire in 1885.
==History==*After a match in the First Chinese-Japanese War (1894–1895) the Cinn Board in 1895 entered the Simanasec Queen, in line with which Japan was granted the right to a sovereign right over the island, and the last minister in Taiwan until 1945.
There are three main objects in the Machu-Picchu complex: the Inichuatana, the temple of the Sun, and the Park with three windows.
To make it possible for tourists to get a better picture of how most of the first buildings on the edges of the complex looked first, the last of them had been rebuilt.
* By 1976, the three-thirty-works of Machu-Picchu had been re-engineered.
So, the most popular in the world is the image format for motionless frames, which is a 35 mm format. On the slope of the era of analogue images, this format of the film was overridden.
This film is still being made, however, more importantly, by the state of its widths and heights is now being used in the formats of the matrix of the digital cameras.
It can be a bit off the pantalk, but in fact the format for 35 mm has 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
* As appropriate, it is considered that the commonalities for this format (after division by 12 to the simplest line of whole digits) is 3:2.
The same or similar commonalities have many common formats (e.g. the APS family).
The rule of the tranquillity, which is often combined with attack and mockery, introduces simple parades that provide for dynamism and at the same time keep the right level of order in the image.
If you believe in it, the best place to place the main project is at the cross-lines that divide the picture in vertical and horizontal flats on the third (see example).
* In this period of European history, the cataloguing king, who became rich and magnificent, was given full attention.
* In all the language and cultural differences that have been in place, the Christian religion has united the European country in over a thousand years.
* Everything — from the King to the Reality — was under her universal ruler.
The essence of one of the main dogma of Christianity is that you need to use this to reduce your head and to legitimize your sacrificiality, and that there are, for that reason, the kind of money that the King has.
* In over a thousand years, the central royal governments have been in Rome, and because of this concentration of power and money, a lot of people wonder if this dogma is being implemented.
* The Great Breath initiated the marina side of Germany shortly after the war action began.
Embargo on the snare of the life of important war- and country-based goods at the home and shattered the generally recognized international law that the last two centuries had been overtaken at the senior level by a number of international reminders, yet an effective strategy had emerged.
The Great Breath replaces international waters so that ships can't be in the right spaces of the ocean, and so it's caused the security of even neutral ships.
* For the reason that much of the reaction to this tactic was unattended, Germany felt that it would also not be able to do the unlimited underwater wars.
In the 1920s, the population of most of the country and the country exceeded the sentiments of pacification and disparateness.
It was the intention of the elders and the nations to escape such a situation in the future, for they had already witnessed horrors and atrocities in the First World War.
Tesla moved to live in the United States of America in 1884, because he managed to work for the Edizan Company in New York.
The total of four cents, a congregation of horsemen and a recommittal letter to Thomas Edisan, written by Charles Bechlar (his manager from his previous job) was in his pocket when he arrived in the U.S.A.
The ancient Chinese have unique ways of denoting different eras. At each stage of China's history, or in each family, there are marked dynasties.
* In addition to this, the period of the control of the melons was divided between the periods of the divisive law when the instability was prevalent, and the best known was the period of the three Kings, which lasted 60 years between the Dinosaurs of Han and Jin.
These periods, many of the twilights that fought for the throne, led to brutal warfare between themselves.
* One of the most crumbling periods in the history of the State of China was the era of the three kingdoms: thousands of people had been killed in the struggle for the opportunity to occupy the highest seat in a large station in Sian.
The French revalidation is a lot of social and political action, and they are moving from absoluteism to the republican system of correction, the introduction of the metrical system, the identification of nationalism, and the re-performing of the country, which is not a single right, but a people.
* In the same way, the different seats after the Revalucion have become available to all male candidates, the result being the most successful and ambivalent at the top.
The same was the case in the army, for when the military had previously been dedicated to the military, when it had left the sacrament, it was now a basic skill and skill.
* In addition, many of the other jumping laborers from other parts of the country were inspired by the French revolt to start their own revolutions.
Magmath was very interested in the questions that went beyond the limits of the life of men. To pursue his medical studies and to be aware, he often visited the five to the Hare of Noor (began as "sacred"), which is known as "Hira".
* The very night that has kept the process of time, gives a very bright picture of the spirits of Magomet.
It is located at the top of one of the mountains, north of Meka.
In fact, it's very hard to find her, even if anyone knows about her existence.
* With the exception of pure, good-looking skies up the top, and many mountain ranges, you can see nothing, and you can see and hear very little of this world out of the berm.
The Pyramid of Heops is the one with the seven wonders of the world that has taken hold of the world to this day.
The Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramids that have been identified to honor the memory of the ungodly pharaoh. It was built in the third century B.C.
* On the Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza Necropale, in the Dahl of Death in Egypt, there is a number of pyramids (the most extreme of which is the Great Pyramid), the shave of smaller towers, a number of temples, and a large Sphinx.
The building of the Great Pyramid was a tribute to the memory of Pharaoh Heops, and many smaller pyramids, temples, and robberies to the wife and members of the Pharaoh's family.
The sign that denotes the movement of the junction up, looks like "V", and down is like a string or square without the lower side.
The "Foot of the junction" means that you have to start moving from the end of the junction and weaving it up, and the "Roar of the junction down" means that you have to start from the colon (where your hand is holding the link) and weigh the lunatic down.
The movement of the link upwards usually produces a softer sound, while the downward is more powerful and more secure.
* You can set your mark as a salon, but remember that the printed symmetries of the symmetries do not just stand there, but with a certain musical opportunity, so they should normally be kept.
* 6 castrica 1789, due to the crowding of women from the market, King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette, and their two small children (the chaste Louis-Charles and the 11-year-old Mary Terez) and Madame Lizavet, the sister of the King, had to return from Versailles to Paris.
The Queen's family was taken to Paris, and on the way they were surrounded by crowds -- people in them were told, lomanted, and threatened in the address of the King and Queen.
The King and the Queen had to open the windows of the carriages under the yoke of men.
* At a certain moment, a man with a memory of memory went out of front of the King, who was and without it was overwhelmed to death, head-killed in Versailles by a sufferer.
The war expenses of the U.S. imperialists, which had been incurred in connection with the invading of the Philippines, had to be paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
In order to pay a significant portion of the costs and work done by the United States, which was stationed through the Banking Lady Wall Street from the name of the Philippine Council, they had to pay the tax to the United States calanial mode.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the imperialists of the U.S. would be the exacerbation that led to the continued exploitation of the Filipino people.
* To imagine who the Templars were, you need to know well what has become a rethinking of the order.
The traditional era, when these events take place, is called the Classic Middle Ages, a period of history of Europe, which is the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1,000–1300 C.E.).
==History==The last one, when it was taken to count, ended in 1500.
Under the term "technological determinism", the term "technological determinism" is used to understand the whole range of practical ideas, from the application of the intent to introduce the right technology or the technical need for an accurate understanding of the fact that humans have been built up in logic, which is based on scientific laws, and their specificity in the field of technology.
Two general ideas are useful for most of the interpretations of technology determinism: the self-development of technology in a significant way goes outside of cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, only makes it (not socially rebuilt) a social impact.
* In private, there is the argument that the use of a car in the vicinity makes the road develop.
However, if the number of machines is small, the totality of the automotive road network is not economical. For this reason, the development of new ways of producing the product, which can reduce the cost of owning the automobile road.
* Because of the large number of auto-owners, increase the number of road crashes. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the field of accommodation, which allows for different trams.
The major element of cultural determinism, on which the works of such writers as Goete, Fichte, and Schlegel had flown, had been a feature of Ramantism.
And when we're getting married about the age of Ramantism, we've had a strong influence on the geographies of the presence, and we've seen the tragedies and the culture associated with it since then, and they've been better than the free passage of laws, because they've been in line with the place and status that the community occupied.
While Paris is considered to be a modern style steel, Constantinopel was known as a European fashion steel in feudal times.
* In 400 C.E., the city acquires knowledge as an epicentre of luxuries and maintains this status almost by 1100 C.E.
This is the 12th-century-century of his status as a stallion of luxuriant patches, and this was, in the main, because there was a return of transponders with gifts, among whom there were sharp spices and slips, and they were much more appreciative than they had offered to the Byzantian markets.
* Then Constantinopel took the style of the Paris fashion table.
The blossom of the ghetto style was between 10 and 11 and 14 in the 14th century.
* At first, a strong influence on the style of the dress was reflected in the Eastern Byzantine culture.
The Western styles may, however, be 25 to 30 years late due to the slowness of the communica channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style at the end of the Midnight, and the fact that people, as a result of cross-country events, began to use the guises to block the resentment went to the extremes of that time.
* In the natural country office, the number of food products produced is as high as that of a farmer and his family.
The natural land industry is a simple and, as the rule is, an arganic system. It is based on the use of the property of the right ecological region of the stored seed in the reduction of sevasion or other generally uncomplicated metadata. The purpose of all this is to get out of the maximal redundancy.
* Many of the land-farms who had had a long history of natural rural landlords, and many of the third world countrysides are still practising it.
Subcultures draw close to people with similar views, who, from the position of social norms, feel overwhelmed, and allow them to develop a sense of self-existence.
. Age, ethnic identity, class, location, and (or) gender of the publishers can be a prominent body of subcultures.
Defining a specific subculture may be based on different factors — language, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or their dispersal.
* Members of the same subculture often define their belongings to it through a clear and symmetrical style of dress, manner of conduct, and jargon.
* As an illustration of what is a socialization and how important it is, it is often an example of children who have not respected the growth in the atmosphere of the hills, the neglect, the various hardships, the neglect and the resentment, and those who have not been socialized in the child.
Some of the “wild” children have been in enslavement for a long time (usually they had their own parents); in individual cases, the absence of a parent's problem was the result of a reluctance on the part of the parents to note the serious physical or intellectual grievances and the inexperience of the child.
* Before they were left behind or escaped, the wild children could have been subjected to serious decorations or besieged by the tragedy.
Others, as if they had been brought up by animals; some of them were said to have been self-serving in a wild monster.
* When a child is completely raised by a living person, his behavior is almost in all (taking into account the physical limits) to reflect the behavior of a life-bearer: for example, such a child may be afraid of humans or be safe to them.
While the objective of the project training is to make the learning process more easy and more interesting, the scoping in this way is still going on.
Scaffolding is not a method of training, but rather a helper to help people learn new stuff in a school. This can mean using new computer applications or starting a new project.
The helplines can be real as well as virtual. For example, the help workers are both a mentor and a small socket in the Microsoft Office program.
* In the software security program, virtual handhelds have been charred, and they need to ask questions, to give tips, and to explain the process with which the student or the listener is hard to deal with on his own.
There are a lot of reasons why children can end up in a good family, and it can be both a hard drive, and a sense of hopelessness, and even a compulsion.
It is not possible to let children grow up in an environment where no one can touch them, they don't bring them up, and they don't do their training, but it's still happening.
In our view, the system of pleasant families is for such children a safe zone.
It is hoped that, by thanking our system of pleasant families, the good families will have a secure medical care, safe ladies, good and cool inmates, and stable education.
It's supposed that a good family has to protect all the needs of a child who didn't have a place in the house before he was taken away.
The Internet is not only a source of mass communication, but also of interpersonal relations.
* Thanks to the special characterization of the Internet, there are additional opportunities for its use and satisfaction of the authenticity of the Internet.
Yes, for example, there is the idea that “education” and “socialization” are difficult things to use in the Internet (James et al., 1995).
* "Permanent Participation" and "Standard Relationships" were also identified by Amy and McCord (1998) as new aspects of the environment in the investigation of the audio response to the Internet site.
* The video has been made, thanks to the video, important openings in the interpretation of myriads, in terms of the movement of the face, which is only a few milliseconds long.
It is stated that the correct interdiction may help to determine whether a person is grieving or telling the truth.
* In his work "Presidency Presentation", Oliver Sachs pointed out that, by imagining brain-harmed people, without understanding the very talk, they might, however, be able to give a fair estimate of the scalability.
It even suggests that the natives, such as the home-wives, can also be able to interact correctly with human behavior.
The results of the studies of the 20th century show that there are two genetic change funds, while the same is true and concealed.
* Under the influence of mutation, new genetic variants emerge, and with the help of a selection, they are removed from the pool of found.
* With each subsequent recovery of segregation and recognition, the variants in the two pools are moved.
* In the savage, there are existing disparate resources that cannot satisfy the need for primates in aminoquislots when they have a brutal system similar to that of a human being.
And more so, if they don't, then the attacks are serious, and it's both an undernourishment, a deprecies of growth, and an inevitable death.
The best available dispersal resources would be the slugs that can be found in the women's and sheets, but if they don't get them properly, then the organisms of primates like us are hard to get.
In fact, the diet of animal affinity (mary, termites, eggs) provides for the archanism of a large number of slugs, rich in all the needed amino acids, and at the same time easy to absorb.
It's not surprising to see that our products have solved their own “black problem” in the same way as the shimpans in the savage today.
* Sleep breaks have to do with the deliberate awakening of a sleeper in the process of normal sleep and the re-entering of a sleeper over a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
To do this can be done by helping with a relative quiet weekmaker that will wake you up, but not entirely.
If it turns out that you're moving the watch in your sleep, try to put it at the other end of the room, so you need to get up out of bed to turn it off.
* In agreement with the other biaritm-based variants, which require a lot of water and tea before bedtime (in the first order of water or tea, in order to make a man get up at night to get up at night).
* Inside a man's tranquillity, inversely, the horizontal stress of his body and spirit.
The real power of life is the more stable than the stress below. Absolute rest and satisfaction are available to everyone.
The sacrificiality can be achieved by everyone, and the only harm on this path is our own indigent and stressful.
* In the main, the Tibetan structure is based on the Buddhism, which was filled with the way of love for the mocha and the Sheraga methods of Indian yoga.
The nature of the Tibetan building is very simple, and it is the subject of health care, Kundalini, and the love for the whole human race.
. The natives of Yogi Kundalini state that to create the energy of Kundalini (power of shining), it is necessary to put in place a proper position of hers, mantras and visualization, as well as to perform breathing practices.
The Bogo is the main part of the practice of the Tibetan Medical Survey, and visualization of the different scales allows for the clean up of the energy channels, the opening of the chakras, and the provision of an enlightened conscience.
In the Second World War, Germany was a common enemy, thanking the USSR and the U.S. for the reason, and after the end of the war, the system, industry, and cultural conflicts led to war between the countries.
* Two years after the end of the war, the Cold War begins — the former Soviets have been turned into enemies.
It lasted the next 40 years, and in the next 40 years, it really fought the armies of friendly lands, and the bits were in different regions, from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
The Polish Warrant was split up by September 17, 1939. The retreat and retrieval along the Romanian postures remained the only hope.
Even so, all night, these plans lost meaning, for more than 800,000 US dollars of the Red Army in the compound of the Belorussian and the Ukrainian Francs entered the territory of the Eastern Regions of Poland in the shaming of the Rizh River-minor, the Russian-Polish Pact on Injuries, and other two-sided and multi-sided international reminiscents.
The transport of cargo by ship is clearly the most effective means of transpondering a large number of people and cargoes through the ocean.
The traditional task of the war-marsh villages was to ensure that their country was able to transform humans and foods, and at the same time the labourer would not be able to outstrip his people and foods.
The North Atlantic Company in the Second World War has become one of the most significant examples of this idea, with the help of the Great British Americans trying to transport people and materials through the Atlantic Ocean.
* At the same time, the Navy of Germany tried to stop the movement in question, using mainly subboats to do so.
Germany would probably have been able to take over and Great Britain in the same way as it had conquered the rest of Europe if the Southerns had made a failure.
It looks like the goats were first tamed in the Iran Hares of Zagros about 10,000 years ago.
*People of ancient cultures and ploughs began to breed them so that they could always have a handful of small, wool, meat, and chicken.

* As early as 16 years ago in England, grass roads had been built.
To keep the roads on the road, and to represent all the parallel woodboards, they let the main horse move with more speed and load the cargo with more weight than on the existing non-main roads.
* Stabs are used to keep reeks at a place pretty early. However, after a while, it became clear that the movement would be more effective when they were covered with pity.
* This practice has been extended, but with the presence of wooden colons of wagons, they have been moving more quickly.
* After some time, the wooden circles had to change, and the first complete metal rails that had been made out of metal had appeared in 1767.
Two million years ago, with the name of Homa erectus (which means "the man of the past"), people started to go to the vertical position.
The Australians, their predecessors, usually didn't go.
==History==The average size of the Australian community is found in the area of accommodation, which is 4.2 to 3.9 million years old, but it is very possible that seven million years ago, the Sahelanthropist had already been on two feet.
You can be more specific about the environment, you can be part of the ecology movement, you can even become an activist, so that in the future the abyss is not very strong.
But if we need more than just a temporary solution, we need to find and remove the root causes of the problem.
It is quite evident that, thanks to the technological and scientific access of humans, the world has changed considerably.
* After the 4th of July of the declaratory was accepted by the Country, her hand-written copy, signed by senior Kangrais John Hankak and the eldest Charles Tomson, was added to the John Dunlap printery, which was located in a number of blocks away.
This night was made from 150 to 200 copies, now known as the Dunlap Paper.
~ July 8, John Nixan for the first time publicized the document in the Indemnance Hall.
~ July 6, George Washington got one of the contacts he had on the 9th of July closed his military in New York. The 10th of the day another was a member of London.
*To this day, 25 of the first printed sets of the Independence Declaration (known as Dunlap Broadsides) have been released.
* Many of the modern pilots think that a group of speakers has managed to survive, and that it even exists, just what we call them Birds.
Because of the frequencies and the ability to fly, many people don't count them as speakers.
But the birds still have a lot of shared roses from the Dinosaurier.
They have knuckles and a lubricant on their feet, they put their eggs, and like the rex, they walk on the two backlegs.
* In practice, all modern computers perform operations with a coded binary number of information.
* Binary numbers can add all of the two digits, 0 or 1, and these numbers are correlated with binary digits, or (on computer jargon) bitumen.
* Inside an intervention may not have a clear effect. For example, the rash is a very general symptom, which makes it impossible to install an immediate diagnostic.
* On the in-house interference, the first thing that can be seen is the open volume of tablets or taxi-cosms.
It is necessary to look at the etiquettes for this concrete attrition.
The term "clop" is used in a formal sense to define this group of all kinds of enthamologens.
This is the term of the prisoner, because people have long known that they think they're target-classes, which are so many of the things that are, at the top, adapted to people's self-consciousness.
* Both the kissing classes and the target clusters are nested parities, and they have been used to live in nests or in the home of their master.
* When 400,000 cases of dispersal sclerosis (DS) are registered in the United States of America, and the same is true that this neurologic disease is the main area among older people of the young and the middle-century age.
Spreaded sclerosis is a disease that affects the nerve system. In the last part, the head and the spinal brain enter in, as well as the optic nerve.
. As a result of the research, it was found that women are twice as often men as men who are victims of the MS.
* A couple may come to the conclusion that it's not the same intel or the kind that they already have.
* Such couples can give their baby to be adopted.
When a parent's father is adopted, the child's parents refuse to give up their father's rights in order to grow and bring it up.
The main object of science is to detect the scientific method of the world's function. In fact, most scientific studies are based on this method.
There is, however, not just him. The experiment (this is the kind of test that comes to disable one or more of the possible hypotheses in the use of questions and observations) also sends and emboldens scientific research.
* Most of all the attention the physicists and naturalists gave to classical text, the first thing to say is that it's going, in number, and about the Bible in Latin.
* Aristoteles' general views at the time were considered to be aristocean in all scientific matters, in fact, in the field of psychology.
* When the number of people in the hands of the language decreased, Zajad ended up gifted by his scientific and physisophilosophic crowns.
* Many biometrics, which can be seen in the behavior and physiology of the living, are hugely dependent on the presence of endogenous kikkers. The latter result in the function of the biological clock.
* In most of the living creatures, the number of bacteria, fishes, sprouts, and diets, there was a number of periodical rhymes, which are not a direct reaction to external periodic alarms.
The Bialogic Hour is an automotive process. Even if the alarms do not proceed, the process continues in the form of the independent free of the current kikals.
* One of the main hypotheses, which claimed that DNA was genetic material, was verified in the course of Hershey and Chase's experiment.
* For the implantation of their own DNA in Hershey and Chase's bacteria, they used fagies or viruses.
They ran two experiments, which, through radioactive phosphorus, marked the DNA of the bacteriaphagus or the radioeactive sulfur, the bolt of the bacteria.
* Depending on the type of mutation, the magnitude of the genetic material in which the mutation took place, and whether or not the cells in her cell are a breeding line, the mutations can have the most different attacks.
The only causes are mutations in embryonic cells. Other effects can result in cellular oblasts or cancer.
The ecology attracts those people who have an interest in visiting different natural zones and territories, because they want to get an accommodation from the common image and landscape, so they're looking at the colors and colors.
* As an example of what you can do at the stage, you can bring fishing, hunting, bird-watching, parks, and essays.
* As an example, you can produce visits, studies, and photographs of anorangutans on the island of Barnea.
Every morning, people are forced on their cars from small lawn halls to go to work, and on the way to work, they are encouraged by other people who work there, from where they just left.
* In this dynamic transport industry, all have the same or different data to be found on a private transport system based on a private car and to support it.
Scientific evidence shows that modern-day high-universal economics has stymied the stability of the biosphere, which has greatly contributed to the evolution of a man in the last two million years.
– The transport systems are used by all the people who are involved in the community life, and almost all of them are unsatisfied with these transport systems.
* In developed lands, you will either hear or hear so many complaints about masts or the quality of water.
Why are transport systems a constant source of similar accounts, why do they regularly promote action? Is there a reason why there are not enough computer-assisted transparant ingenieurs? Is there something more real?
\x{\cH00FF00} The "Transport Movement" refers to an analysis of the movement of individual managers and transport links between the two points, as well as the identification of how they interact between themselves.
* Sadly, the identification of transport streams poses a complex problem, since it is not possible to demonstrate the behaviour of the managers in a workable way.
* Managers, in luck, tend to behave fairly sequentially; for, as the rule is, the flow of transport is characterized by an accurate, rationally remunerated follow-up and can be well described with the help of mathematical models.
To show more fully and in some way that the movement of the transport subsoils represents itself, the three basic parameters are: (1) flow, (2) volume, and (3) speed.
The existence of these links helps to plan and design road objects and also to exploit them.
The first of the livelies in the air had a lot to catch up with. The ability to fly helped them more effectively to remove the enemies, as well as to find partners and food.
* In most cases, the wings of all sorts are located at the side of the body.
* By reason of this, they may be killed in different very small places to hide out of the treacherous.
* Strucks and midwives are today the only so many that can't make wings.
A man named Aristarchus, a few thousands of years ago, said that the solar system was circling around the sun.
There were some who believed that he had a rationality, but there was a lot of other thinking that the solar system (then the number of the Sun and the Other Stars) was going around the Earth.
It's smart to say it's smart, because when on Earth, it's hard to say, it's nothing, isn't it?
The Amazon River occupies another place on the Earth for a long time among all the other years, and is the largest of them, and the water in it is eight times more than the water in the same place.
The most extensive cancer on earth is the Amazon, sometimes its vastness reaches six miles.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 water-related water products that are coming from the lakes of the planet.
The Amazon River, which contains water from thousands of smaller rivers, has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 m).
Though the construction of the pyramid with the use of the stone went on to the end of the Old King's era, by the size and technical perfection of the building, no one has ever been able to reach the Giza's pyramids.
The period of history of the Novaya Empire has come to the enlightenment of the monuments that have been shared by their products, which at that time have been over a thousand years.
