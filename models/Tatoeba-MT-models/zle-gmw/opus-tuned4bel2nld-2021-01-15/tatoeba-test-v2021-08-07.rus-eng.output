A white pawn on f3, a black pawn on e6, a white pawn on g4, a black queen on h4-mat!
Whites: a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Blacks: pawns on a7 and b7, King on a8, Elephant on b8. Whites place the rival in the position of the tshogwang, positioning the torch on a6, and then blacks have only two options: to take the torch on a6 or to move the elephant to any other field of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, whites move the pawn from b6 to b7 and put the mat. In the second case the white torch takes the black pawn on a7 with the same result.
