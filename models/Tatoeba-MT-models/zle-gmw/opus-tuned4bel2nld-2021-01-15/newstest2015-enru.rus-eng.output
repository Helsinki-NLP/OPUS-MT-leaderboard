The Russian FANO will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia), together with the RNA, will hold the third Expert Session on the Assessment of the Effectiveness of the Activities of the Scientific Organizations.
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, as reported in a press release to Lenta.Rue.
At the third meeting, it is planned to take stock of the work of the Expert Session over the year and to draw up a final list of indicators to measure the impact of scientific organizations.
Individual participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of the scientific groups and the criteria for the conduct of the assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to create a one-size-fits-all approach to the assessment of the impact of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have been able to do so, and the final version of the normative instruments is in the process of being negotiated.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the process of science and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment,” said the head of the expert and analytical office of the Russian FANO, Elena Axenova.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than 100 scientific institutions in Russia.
As a result, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at the City of Moscow, Solanka Street, House 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of experts will make it possible to search for kinsmen among the stars, that is, from the same cluster.
The results of their studies have been published in the magazine Nature and are available briefly on the University's website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearest stars is the turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas that precedes the formation of the stars.
Even if a born star then leaves the star cluster, the chemical composition of the star can determine the place of its birth and the region of its birth.
In the past, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster might lead to differences in its chemical content from that of a relative in the cluster.
The model results of astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their research, experts modelled two streams of interstellar gas, which together formed a cloud.
This object, for a few million years under its own gravity, is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added tags to the initial gas streams and found that rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud achieved a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
Astrophysics believe that their research proves that it is possible to look for chemically related stars, as well as for possible regions of the formation of such sites.
Carrata Police arrested a 20-year-old after following a motorbike at high speed.
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at 125 km/h in the area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and across the bushland to escape the Pilbar Police.
A transport patrol in Carrat this morning tried to stop the blue motorbike, detecting a speed of 125 km/h when it left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continued on the Burgess Road, then rolled off to the bushland, which left the police out of sight.
The motorcycle and the driver's description were spotted next to the Wallcott Way house in Bulgarra.
The Carrata police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and driving dangerously.
He is to be brought before the Carrata Court of Justice on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.
The school year in the DND will not start before October

Judge Lady Ray scheduled a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh on November 17.
Lavrov: Russia will not "knock the door" in connection with the new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not "knock the door" in connection with the new sanctions.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergey Lavrov, made this statement today to the students and professors of the MGIMO.
With regard to our response to a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything must be specifically calculated,' he said.
And when we figure out what European and American partners are gonna do this time, then we'll decide how to respond.
This will not involve slaming doors, some sort of resentment, misunderstood,' the Minister stressed.
First of all, we will be moving away from our interests, our interests to protect our economies, our social sectors, our citizens, our business, and will draw conclusions from the actions of the partners to ensure their adequacy, contractability and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions can be very well judged by what partners are doing, as continued by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
If the whole voice is said that "they're gonna be painful for us, too, but we have to do it to punish Russia," it's probably not very appropriate."
As far as the WTO is concerned, the withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions is not.
On the other hand, we want to learn more about the tools of the WTO, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, we believe, the EU ' s discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping, while applying anti-dumping measures against the Russian economy.
“We are ready to use the WTO mechanisms and to defend our position that the third EU power pack should not be applied retrospectively,” said Lavrov.
How do you use the grayberries in the design of the garden?
Answers Irina Okuneva:
As the graybery loses its main attraction after blooming, it is desirable to plant it along with other bushes.
It fits perfectly with many cultures.
And you can and should plant plants that are decorative at different times and bloom at the same time.
Another plus-siren is that it offers a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stamp tree of different heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base, and even a likeness of a garden bonsae, a tree with a bizarrely curved stem.
Just choose the form that is more in line with the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a man in Leningrad County was convicted of selling counterfeit money.
According to the national Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was involved in his criminal activities in the Olonetsk and Segezh districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other parts of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in inheriting the Vologd region, where he had been sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment in the spring of the year.
Later, the man was brought before the Olonets District Court.
And to complete the investigation of crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segejo.
In the course of the investigation, a number of episodes of the sale of counterfeit money in the summer of 2013 have been proved guilty.
At the end of June this year, the criminal record of the indictment was sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to replace the term of deprivation of liberty with four years in a general-regime colony.
The sentence did not enter into force.
Let's recall, last week, two more counterfeit money dealers were convicted of paying for it in Petrozavodsk's stores.
The citizens of Azerbaijan had also come to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is incarcerated for five years, the other for four.
A fine of 500,000 roubles is imposed on everyone.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
In Archangelsk, the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy, "Dervish"
The rally, which was held at the district centre, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
The Durvish delivered military assistance from the US and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
In Archangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the site of a future monument to the northern convoys, which is located on the Cedov River name in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of Veteran organizations of the Archangels, children of the cadets.
For the first time, we met twenty-three years ago when the mortgage stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a festival, but a day of memory of those who have not been returned by the sea,” noted Boris Karpov, chairman of the North Sea Veterans' Council.
The event was followed by the town's perfume band, and the cadets of the cadets gave the veterans flowers and marched with the Russian flags and the banner of the Victory.
The meeting ended with the placing of colors on a mortgage stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of uniformed boots, tin, wool, and a host of other tools and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and armament - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Harrikane fighter jets - were on board in disassembled condition.
At the same time, the escort was 16 British Navy ships, including two carriers.
The ship's caravan was not found by the opponent and reached its destination, Archangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 were killed by transport and about 50 by military vessels.

Recalling the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis proposed a bill under which trade union organization is protected as a civil law.
"Where trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, a Democrat from Minnesota, who is the co-chair of the Progressive Fracture Congress.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act, along with the symbol of the civil rights movement, John Lewis.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade union organizations as other forms of discrimination by halting the forces of trade union opponents
The amendment of the Labour Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for taking part in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in the civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis, and the drafters of the bill offer is to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks on trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states all over the country - Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when that country was simultaneously defending democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his associates helped the country adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that the war-ridden autocracy of Hideki Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware of the role that workers and their trade unions play in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate and to act collectively is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his associates helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler’s fascism had been replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the need for workers to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to everyone and to every profession or activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will have no legal effect; measures to that end will be considered illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, to be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to defend his or her interests”.
In generations, Americans have accepted as a proper basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and to have the union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the nation's forces, but has increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it should be for us.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - was long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are reviving ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge is temporarily blocking a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the U.S., the federal judge temporarily blocked the enactment of the Louisiana Act on Sunday, about which his supporters say that he is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana, Bobby Ginadl, in June, and was to enter into force on 1 September, the doctors who perform abortions would have had the power to receive patients in the hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that, to date, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions by continuing to seek such authorization.
"The appellants will be allowed to work legally while continuing to exercise their powers," wrote Judge John de Gravells in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled within the month at which the judge will render a more permanent decision under the Act.
Advocates of the right to an abortion gladly met this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to get hospital authority.
“Today's decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from an insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northap, president and head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed a motion to stop the law on behalf of three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to the doctors in the two clinics who did not file a complaint in the case, and also applied for admission.
Louisiana is a member of the 11 states that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the admissions laws impose medical restrictions that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion objected that such measures were aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some also noted their positive effect in closing the clinics.
Only one doctor who performs an abortion in Louisiana has the power to attend the hospital, informed the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state had to stop doing this procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would have stopped doing it, the group reported.
Criticizing that decision, the Louisiana officials said that they would not punish the doctors who performed the abortions while their applications for admission were pending a decision.
The result of the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each product in the range of trade networks must be Russian, and Oleg Nilov, a member of the State Duma of the Fair Russia faction, considers them to be Russian.
The Parliamentarian has drafted a bill to introduce protective measures against domestic producers, writing in the newspaper Izvestia.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort to the buyers.
This is the case for goods that are not produced in Russia, and for the rest of the product groups that are produced in Russia, the Riteiller will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers,” Nilov reported to the edition.
Together with the amendments to the article “On the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation”, the bill provides for the amendment of the Tax Code, which establishes a lower rate of VAT of 10 per cent for the marketing of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is part of a package of incentives for Russian producers.
There will be more than a few times more domestic goods on the counters.
However, the initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, say experts.
According to the lawyer of the tax company, a member of the independent expert centre “Public Duma”, Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food sectors, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
The pros will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means they'll get more.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, as they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will result in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, and some industries will start to expand, some will become more self-sustainable, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will drop several times, but not immediately,” the expert observes.
In the past, Russian enterprises were often unable to access local stores because of high competition from foreign analogues.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been freed up and can breathe a breath of relief.
But let us not forget that, after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey, and Serbia will flow to the Russian market.
In other words, now is the moment of quiet, when the former players have already left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
About a month later, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the rise in the prices of finished products,” said AIF.ru, the first vice-president of the Russian public organization, the Russian Club of Financial Directors, and Tamara Kasyanov.
It is clear that the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food in each category will help to secure the sector for local producers.
In that case, they would compete with each other, not with goods that, through subsidies from another State, were cheaper.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will be waged between companies operating under the same industry law.
On the other hand, Kasyanov notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots in far less than all the articles.
And in this situation, the trade networks will have to “create” the share of Russian goods up to half of the range.
As a result, there is a growing fear that poor products will be brought to the counters.
Perhaps, under the guise of being produced in Russia, foreign products will be supplied with broken labels,” the expert adds.
The negative impact of quota implementation will be felt by large trade networks, particularly those that are more advantageous to co-operate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer as the demand for their products drops.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian produce may give way to import analogues, while shops will be able to inflate the price of the second product as a deficient product.
In the early 2000s, economists again talked about the idea of import-immunization in February this year because of the continued devaluation of the ruble.
Now, in the face of a difficult relationship with the West, the issue of non-importing products is becoming even more urgent.
The law is intended to require retellers to be treated with domestic producers when ordering suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the way to import, and the product planning system will be put in place in a shorter time frame,” says MP Oleg Nilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism will be for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to cover the Russian store counters completely.
In addition, meat production can produce a strong impulse.
As is known, the highest proportion of imports is maintained for beef, between 30 per cent and 35 per cent.
So 65 to 70% of the product is still Russian,” Kasyanov reasoned.
The experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to import and may speed up the process.
However, this initiative will not in itself lead to import, as it requires a set of measures, I believe Litvinenko.
In any event, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative may still be imported from abroad, which means that no full import will take place, but significant steps will be taken.
In addition, it is not enough to set quotas, but it is still necessary to produce domestic products in the country in order to meet those quotas.
The quota data will provide such guarantees,” the expert notes.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than urban residents.
Researchers analysed the disease maps of over 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35% had lived five years after the diagnosis.
The lead researcher, Susan Jordan, at the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research, reported that the probability of dying during the study is 20 percent higher for those living in the state regions and remote areas than for those living in urban areas.
A LITTLE STUDY: New drugs can slow down lung cancer and ovarian cancer
Researchers have tracked the women's medical path in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the existence of current diseases, and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote states, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecology, and they are mostly in big cities," she said.
Despite the improvement in the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of out-of-area services that would enable professionals to treat women closer to the home and support programmes for people in treatment far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical location, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, emphasizing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Chancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank, Elisha Neev, was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open the door in the Kujener district
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktybelik was started in April of this year and was based on a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of Chapter Mary Al, the project was financed from the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the facility under construction is almost 230 square metres.
Health care will be provided to the inhabitants of eight localities: the village of Toktybeliac and the villages of Dementievo, Püncherymal, Tuna, Fomichi, Toribelac, Shinur and Cheskaal.
The new health centre will replace the existing FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long run out of resources, and its premises do not meet the sanitary requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
The killer of a four-month-old son in a drunken state will be brought to justice.
The woman in Chuvashia will be on the bench for the murder of her own child.
In Ceboxasar, the criminal case of a 31-year-old inhabitant of Novogochezarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation found that, on 26 July this year, the accused, together with his four-month-old son, had come to celebrate the birth of the child of his home in Ceboxara.
After a long table, the new schoolteacher decided to stay and put the baby to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, the sober woman put it next to her bed to feed her breasts, but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, the woman fell on her son, causing him to die of asphyxiation.
The criminal case, according to the U.S. Press Service of the U.S.C.C. for Chuvashi, is brought to court.
Inflation's out of vacation.
Will the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices
As a result of the Russian Federation's and West's cross-fired sanctions, inflation in Russia will accelerate and fail to respond to the authorities' predictions, and the analysts of the TBT Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015 by RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast by the Ministry of Economic Development, inflation in 2014 will be between 6.5 and 7.5 per cent, down from 6.5 per cent in the following year.
However, according to the newspaper Comersant, this week the IER is expected to make “small but principled” adjustments to the macro-economic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can lower the rate of inflation for 2015 to eliminate the expected upturn in the population ' s income.
The forecast assumed that the Russian Federation ' s food sanctions were in force for a year, until August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation presupposes a one-time shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change,” said the newspaper’s source in Minfin.
The BTB-Capital economists do not share the Government's financial and economic expectations for inflation and forecast a price rise of 8 per cent in 2014.
The main effect of food bans will be combined with the possible introduction of a sales tax (SL tax) in the RF regions in 2015.
Inflation peaks of 9% will take place in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will slow down, according to experts.
By the way, last week, Rosstat failed the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed “soft sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed the experts and found out their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deyev, Head of the Analysis Department of the FC AForex:
Prices are already rising for the main segments of the goods.
Moreover, when socially important products began to be valued, the Government was forced to implement system-wide price stability monitoring to prevent the risk of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Vendors and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to the regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason is triggering the price hike.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the huge rate of capital outflow, the over-funding of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal convertion due to the flight of the population to foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If the inflationary pressure had been kept under control, the cost of the basket of a minimum set of products would not have jumped by 12 per cent in a quarter alone.
The ban on the import of food had caused a supply shock on the domestic market and had led to a perfectly logical increase in the final cost.
As we are not in a position to fully implement the import-imposition mechanism at the current stage, as well as to improve the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the sanctions will continue to bear the risks of the growth of the inflationary component.
By the end of this year, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent if the fiscal reasons for the lack of trust in the national currency, as well as the poorer prospects for economic growth, are added.
Alexander Rasuwaev, Director of the Analysis Department of Alpari
In the 1990s, inflation was sometimes up to 20-30% a month, and in the zeros it was also above the current level, another thing that was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think the year's inflation will be 8-8.5 per cent.
Plato Maguta, U.C. Asset Manager, Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with the sanctions against Russia is still being successfully restrained, but if there is a further rise in pressure, particularly on the financial sector, it can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually reflected in the purchase of cash currency to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the Russian Federation CB and the Ministry of Finance will try to soften the smooth weakening of the ruble by both market and public regulation.
But the price rise starts traditionally after summer quiet and may become more visible this fall.
Russia’s target of 7.5 per cent of consumer inflation is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
The horticultural centres are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, due to the exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, may cause horticulture centers to lose tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the “primary age of horticulture,” according to a study by HTA, reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, renters spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount spent by homeowners on horticulture.
It refers to an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without orchards, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of the parking home, and the reduction of the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, with an estimated annual sales rate of £5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest spending rate in the United Kingdom on gardening goods per household.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that renting and lack of garden space do not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the Chief Gardening Advisor at RHS, said, "The growing of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants, who can transport plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden age” of the retail trade in horticulture products, as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year, thanks to better weather after the adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture carried out mass-cleaning at the Earth Islands Foundation
Three of the four heads of the Earth Islands Foundation were replaced on Friday.
A total of three of the four heads of the Landdelia Foundation were replaced on Friday.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture officially reported only the removal of Atanas Dogov as Executive Director.
Lozan Vasiliev took his place.
It turned out that two of the three Fund's Deputy Executive Directors had been quietly replaced on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatiana Angelov, who had been in charge of State aid and the SAPARD programme, has been released, informs BGNES by reference to the newspaper Trudd.
I didn't attend the fund's board because by law we weren't members of the board, but I was later told that I was released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal is not reported on the Foundation's website.
I'm on vacation.
"I hope I know more on Monday," said Angelov.
Ivanka Bagatov, who was still the head of "Investment Credit" at the central foundation in "Landland" in Sofia, will take her place.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nikolai Dachev, was also released.
Until then, it was responsible for direct subsidies for the fields paid by the EU.
Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the Regional Directorate of the Landdelia Foundation in the city of Velgo-Ternovo, will be appointed to his seat until January 2014.
Only the Deputy Chief of the Atije Aliyev-Veli Foundation retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey summons an American diplomat in connection with a report of spying
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey summoned the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent reported that the American Chargé d'affaires and Turkish officials had discussed the message on Monday.
The German magazine "Der Spiegel" and the Internet magazine "The Intercept" reported that the documents provided by former U.S. National Security Analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for US and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news agencies, the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan, undercut the importance of this report, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Previous reports that the German General Intelligence Agency had also made Ankara a target of intelligence have provoked a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies united against Alibaba
Chinese companies, among which China's largest real estate developer, Dalian Wanda Group, and the Internet Giants Tencent Holdings (Society, Massenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are setting up a company that will compete in the online trade with Alibaba.
But catching up on the wonder of the Chinese Internet, which even left behind its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the Greatest
Companies are planning to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million), 70 per cent will belong to Wanda, and 15 per cent to each of the Internet companies, according to Wanda Group.
It is planned to register the firm in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent, and Wanda's infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fair hotels, the Wanda group manages at least 49 commercial properties throughout China and 40 shopping centers.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (over $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a theme park in Qindao (a city in the east of China on the shore of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors per year and generate a profit of $960 million per year.
In addition, Wanda owns the American AMC Entertainment Holdings, making the company the world's largest cinema operator.
By 2015, Wanda is planning to provide all its shopping centres, hotels and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the emerging rival Alibaba.
According to Dun Ce, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site is to be the world's largest platform online-to-offline, notes Dong Ce.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) is to attract customers online to go to regular offline stores or to buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sale of coupons like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "bird" in the online commerce," said the head of Wanda Van Jianglin (quota on Bloomberg).
"Now there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation the odds are about the same," he believes.
China's Internet market is the world's largest, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will more than triple by 2015 from 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, with Bloomberg providing official statistics: this is the largest population in the world, with the exception of India.
And it is projected that by 2015 that this number can rise to 850 million.
Union of the Rich
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten was until recently the richest man in China, but according to the Bloomberg Millionaires Index, the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, had already outpaced it by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share in Alibaba.
Baidu's manager, Robin Lee, is now ranked third among China's richest people, while Van Jianglin of Wanda is ranked fourth.
"It's very interesting to see this battle: the three richest men are working together to challenge the richer one," said Bloomberg, director of the Chinese e-business research centre in Hangzhou Tsao Lai.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Aliba right after it was created: "Rome can't be built in one day."
The fact that it is not easy to compete with Aliba not only with new companies, but also with well-deserved world Internet leaders is evident from the report on the last quarter of Aliba's financial performance that was published the previous day.
Alibaba is often described as the average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than the two American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit over the period is almost double the sum of the total competitors - it grew by almost three times the annual figure to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a huge potential for generating money, largely thanks to his mobile applications," comments Bloomberg's Analyst in Hong Kong's Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba prospect on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, well above the March figure (163 million).
In addition, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of her shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 Bloomberg analysts, the company can be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg, Aliba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) can take place as early as 16 September.
The Road-show company, which precedes this event, is scheduled to start on 3 September.
It is expected that Alibaba's release to the IPO will be record in the history of NYSE and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the US stock market record was in the Visa payment system, which in 2008 made a first-time investment of $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food in the trade networks should be produced in Russia, and members of the State do.
They had drafted a bill on the subject.
These are the changes to article 8 of the FM, “On the basis of State regulation of trade in the Russian Federation”, and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, of at least 50 per cent of the domestic product in the shops should be for each product.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruit in winter, so they will be given a “shortcut” to avoid possible discomfort to customers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the tax code of the Russian Federation, which sets a lower rate of VAT of 10 per cent for the sale of all food items of which Russia is the country of origin, and reports to the newspaper Izvestia.
On 27 August, a bill was submitted to the lower House of Parliament to amend the FZ “On Retail Markets”, which proposes to re-establish in Russia farm markets in which small-scale producers will be able to sell their products.
Chief of Police Magalufa is charged with corruption
The complainants submitted evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the State Attorney of Malorca on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvia on the Malorca resort island was arrested as a result of charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandalous mawluffée unbridled drinking center.
The Chief Inspector, José Antonio Navarro, was detained as a result of allegations of corruption by a number of businessmen in Punta Ballen, a street in which most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online Mallorca Diario, the complainants submitted evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the Malorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two more local police officers had been arrested by the Spanish National Guard on charges of corruption and would be interrogated by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say that protectionism by the authorities seriously affects their business.
"The talk is no longer about making money, it's about surviving," said a businessman to the court.
Our livelihoods cannot be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was hit in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer blowing 24 men in a bar race.
Since then, the island has been trying to stop drunkenness among resting Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandalous alcohol races in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the blowjob incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and Carnage runners together were fined a Y55,000 ($73000).
The Magaluf Tourist resort, mostly popular among young British resters, was also the site of numerous alcohol-intoxicated accidents associated with the crazy fun known as "balconing," when people jump from one balcony to the next or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WEEKS prepared a cold surprise in South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9:00 p.m. in the evening, following the 6.6 mm that fell in the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short rains with a stormy wind, including a storm that began just before 8:00 p.m. and spilled almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter released an early portion of the spring last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
Squilist conditions are expected to be one of the reasons for the delay in landing Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land right after 7:30 p.m., but hit the wind shift zone - a sudden change in the speed or direction of the wind at short distance - and was forced to climb high.
The wind storms reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to climb at the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay in the flight led to the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is predicted in Adelaide on Tuesday, with the probability of one or two rains.
Calculation of the construction cost in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as the problems of network connectivity, are subject to special control by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The FAS has set up an expert board for the promotion of competition in the field of construction.
At the meeting, the head of the FAC Control, Construction and Natural Resources Office, Vadim Solovyev, stated that “the current calculation of the construction budget is completely incomprehensible”.
The regulatory framework renders pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable cost of construction, is considered by the FAS.
And they offer the cost of constructing public property at the design stage to determine, on the basis of market prices, design solutions instead of the currently estimated standards and single costs for technology operations.
These proposals are included in the road map and are currently under consideration in the ministrate.
“Replacing the traditional construction estimates by calculating the design elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” explains Vadim Solovyev's “RGB.
After all, the budget now calculates each bolt and ballet, and it is not always possible to check it, so sometimes in the records, unscrupulous construction companies can bury “integrated tractors”.
In a ministro, the FAC agrees.
“The first designs for the costing of the design elements are already in place: methodologies for the calculation of the cost of the design solutions, the calculation of the estimates for these indicators,” said the head of the Department of Urban Planning and the Mining Architecture, Elena Zhukov.
Road construction has been selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As RGB's head of the Pro-Invest Construction Company, Anatoly Demianco, said, the estimated standards have long been out of date, but no other business mechanism has yet been proposed.
“As far as the proposed calculations for design elements are concerned, this is difficult to implement in practice, as the construction of buildings often uses very different technologies,” he considers.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing in large part thanks to government orders.
According to the Chairman of the NP, “Expert Community of Professionals of State Order”, Catherine Lezina, the State is the most solvent client today.
The Deputy Director of Engineering of the Rosatom Branch Capital Construction Centre, Vladimir Malakhov, noted that the market is now conditionally divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts, and to companies that have monopolistic competences and do not allow competitors to do so.
He believed that a transparent market was possible only if access to contracts was protected as far as possible from the influence of someone.
At the Expert Council, it was suggested that a system of public order should be established in such a way that the same performer was not entitled to more than one contract of more than 1 billion roubles or more than 1 billion roubles.
In the ministrate, it is believed that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of business impact as well as the efficiency of building management.
As Elena Zhukov explained, in this case it will be necessary to assign to the client the functions of the design contractor, which will result in an increase in the number of clients and the budget for the maintenance of the client.
In doing so, clients will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by the contracting organizations, as well as their safety.
Often, such a breakdown will need to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly qualified bidders due to a lack of interest in obtaining a public order for part-time work and a small sum of the contract.
The heads of the Institute of Procurement's expert advice centre, Alexander Eustashenkov, believe that the State order process has now become a business game for the care of the contractor.
An example was given: “A party, when completing an application, should indicate `specific indicators', without specifying the words `or equivalent', `must be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be, `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be', `to be' etc.
Thus, clients often abuse their right to prescribe the content of an application submitted by the contracting organizations.
Another problem 44-FZ, in the view of Eustashchenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work at the application stage through the participant's “paper” proposal.
When considering the participant's application, it is only the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of the work that has not even begun, that is, the expert suggests.
The quality of the work can be assessed only when it is accepted.
The expert board had also proposed that the margin of income from the upper to the lower echelon should be transferred to ensure that intermediate contractors would disappear.
The Chairman of the Council of Experts, the State Secretary, the Deputy Head of the FAS, Andrey Czarkovsky, believes that this is not the case, as the contractor must be responsible for the order.
Or else, like in a famous reprisal of Arkady Rykin's Athele, "Do you have a problem with buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday, after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the Territory recovered from the fighting.
The start of the school was a source of joy and excitement to the rocket-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the south town of Ashdod, the Pashos kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of fragments from the walls and rollers before the students arrived.
"We're a bit afraid, but we're happy to look to the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Sa'ad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our region do need to return to a normal life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly she'd start going back to school "a little weird."
"We had a hard time, and we didn't get out of our homes at all," she said.
President Reven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz, which is close to the Gaza border, to express his support.
Prior to the cease-fire last week, thousands of people in border settlements, such as Saad, did not go out or left their homes, moving to safer areas far from the Gaza Strip to escape from rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a fragment of a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which had made a great deal of effort from the Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study carefully and said, "We will do our best to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately put an end to the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as the Hamas demand to lift the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of the two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians, three quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, were estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations, lost their lives in the war.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of the people killed were militants; however, it did not provide any substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
In the meantime, the Israeli army carried out over 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip had been damaged and destroyed, and it was estimated that 250,000 people had taken refuge in more than 100 schools, which had been converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fighting continued, the education officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon open up so that we can complete our education like the children of the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a school in Gaza.
According to the popular criteria, real estate prices have shown the largest winter growth in seven years.
The housing cost index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 per cent in August, and RP data was reported by RP data on Monday.
This increase led to a combined 4.2 per cent increase in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double that of 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly spread across the country.
The RP Data Director, Tim Lawless, reported that Sydney and Melbourne run a two-tier market.
Figures of RP Data show that in Sydney the price of housing rose by 16.1 per cent over the past year, while in Melbourne it rose by 11.7 per cent.
The next major markets were Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where the average price rose from 5 to 6 per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government cost cuts took place, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that, now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties put on the market over the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
"Bearing in mind the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
How People Live in the Oldest House of Ufa
In the former home of the gold and mining industry, Yevdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October revolution, 57/1 (former Greater Kazan) had 18 flats.
The 18th-century house has not changed much since the construction, except for the old age.
Foreigners come here as an excursion, and the tenants suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege of living in the oldest Ufim home, whose walls remember General Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the building is not accurate, and historians point to two dates, 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out that the building is 300 years old.
Old courtyard, always open door, violin ladder.
The doors to the apartments are close to each other, the walls are cracked, and the street is visible in the openings of the shredded plaster.
It looks like it's all about telling the truth.
And the locals say, "You don't think it is."
Living in an 18th-century wooden house is very difficult, says Tatiana Lukianova, a resident of apartment number 3.
The object is on the state guard, but the money for its maintenance has not been spent for decades, and we feel like museum artifacts that the authorities have simply forgotten.
Last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still clinging, but the foundations are rotten.
Many of the tenants still go to the toilet outdoors, and they wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be content under such conditions?
The road goes right under the windows, not even a footpath.
Tatiana is moving the curtain.
Now you can see what you've only heard before: there's a flow of cars under the windows.
You see, the window's dilapidated all the time, we can't open the window, we're used to the noise.
You get used to everything, to the good and the bad.
Our apartment is still perfect, thanks to his husband, his hands are golden.
Besides, we have two rooms, the three of us live with our son.
And other families have a much worse environment, and the second floor is a little bit over a foot high.
To contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment 6 to Ludmile Old Man.
A nice, hospitable woman from the door offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a single-room flat, 14.5 square meters per four people, and we live with my husband and my daughter and my granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another area, and Ludmila's eyeballing the room: antressoli, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and very different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But there is a regular flow from the ceiling: the water system is no good.
Ludmila talks about her apartment at the same time as an Italian woman whose home is on the Roman ruins.
I mean, it's one very old and recent, everyday and legendary thing:
The water pipeline was run some 40 years ago during the last repairs.
At the same time, we had a small kitchen in a box and a toilet from the former closet.
We live just where Demidov and his family lived, and there were servants on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Center, it's said that privatization doesn't matter.
We'll only get a single-room flat anyway, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, they promised to displace us, but it didn't go any further.
I'm not used to complain, and I'm not gonna complain.
There was a dynasty in this apartment (room!): my grandparents, my mom and dad, my husband and my daughter and granddaughter.
There's been a lot of things in that time.
For example, big rats ran in the kitchen.
Look at the wall of the fridge, it's a meter thick!
They say the solution was on the eggs, so it's been holding up for so long.
The house is well-built, thanks to Demid!
That's probably why no one's been killed by a crashed ceiling or his own.
Only the building is slowly dying in front of us: the planks and logs of the house are rotting, the floors have collapsed, we have poured cement, but it's useless - the solution goes to the ground like a well.
They say it is, under our room, a secret loophole and a move to the White River, which was deliberately made by the old men who once lived here, to be able to escape the danger, in the event of it.
They were being chased.
Ludmila Starstin tells us how some historian came to see them, begged to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then he convinced me to give them the place in exchange for his one on October Prospect.
Ludmila to the historian refused:
Where are we four in one?
And here, at least a small hope is that it's going to make a bigger place.
If we agreed to the trade, we wouldn't have won anything.
Even so, the Old Men's family won nothing.
Ludmila's biggest dream to be scattered, and her 16-year-old daughter was given a separate room.
So two families have set aside a two-bedroom apartment instead of the most majestic ruins in which two generations live.
The cute, miniature girl Olesha Karsakov from apartments 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, her large family lives in two small rooms, with a total area of 23 square feet [23 m2].
There are seven of us, two of us.
You can see the conditions.
The scoop falls off with bits, as do the window frames, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms, throughdoor holes.
The water in the crane all year long is cold.
When you go through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, you can make sure that the Lorrentev's wives are the luckiest in apartment 4.
They're occupying the most spacious rooms on the ground floor.
You're right, there's plenty of space!
It's 75 squares, it's three people.
We live in the right rooms, where the legend is that Suvorov was staying in Ufa, says the family head Alexander Dmitriyevich Lawrence.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One thing's bad, it's all cracking up, it's falling apart, it's falling apart.
Neighbors must have told you!
The most agony we've had with the floors is that the wooden planks have rotted, the ground has literally left under our feet.
I've set up the sockets, the bow, and there's nothing in the hall, and in the other room we're swinging like a swing, so shaky.
Alexander Dmitriyevich can best tell about the home of the merchant Eudokim Demidov.
A gold industryman is treated like a native, speaks with admiration of him.
In fact, the identity was extraordinary: the owner of the Kagin and Ujiang factories built houses, poured guns and bells, and held Ural mines.
The heirs of the property are proud of their ancestor, but they don't want to live under the same roof as history.
I lived here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitriyevich.
Then there were wooden carriages, stables, and guard booths that had been demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our home, but something was interrupting...
The story recurred in 2014: a new home was lured.
As a team, we collected all the files, ran the right offices, and all of a sudden we found out that moving to the apartments was moving to 2015 or 2016.
Somethin' doesn't believe in it anymore...
Two years ago, Lawrence went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bascortostan to learn about the fate of the home.
The tenants didn't accept the tenant.
Sent from one table to the next, and then, as a mockery, issued a paper without a signature or a stamp: "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the settlement of the tenants."
I even get the feeling that our home is no longer in the city, because it was first number 57, then it was 57 A, and now it's 57/1.
It's like it's been demolished in the '70s.
The Russian Planet has reached out to the head of the Information and Analysis Branch of the Ufa Land Office, Vladimir Barabash.
It is part of the old housing settlement programme.
I can't be held responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, but I know there was a plan at the time to destroy all the old houses, despite the historic significance.
Happily, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities to rebuild all the old houses on the October revolution, which represent architectural value, is being successfully implemented.
The residents are about to be resettled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the House of Demidov will be an Italian specialist who was involved in the restoration of the buildings in Venice.
An architectural biennal is currently under way in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there, among others.
I hope that by 2016, the entire old Kasan Street will be restarted, says the official.
Homes will become suitable for what was earlier, three centuries ago.
The House of Demidov is likely to become a museum open to all.
In addition, a decision was made at the government level to make the street a walker on weekends.
On a weekday, unfortunately, it's not going to work, it's going to be too busy in the city.
He promises to resettle people from the future museum, Vladimir Barabash, in 2015.
However, it is unlikely that they will be content: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from a different era.
A forest fire broke out in Primorje because of the storm
The dry storm caused a forest fire in the area of the Hunting Plant Foresting in the Primorsk district of the region.
There is a build-up of forces and assets at the site of the fire.
According to the management of the Maritime Air Base, the conditions created at the site of the fire require the engagement of the air force.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Chief of the Air Base:
A fire in a hard-to-reach area was detected by an observer pilot from an An-2 patrol aircraft in an area of 3 hectare.
The wood leftovers on the old burner are on fire.
A strong terrain and a steep slope of more than 45 degrees, the absence of suitable fire landing sites pose significant challenges to the carnage.
We need an MI-8.
The movement of forces by the MI-2 and AN-2 aircraft at the disposal of the airbase is very difficult.
After the discovery of the fire, four parachute firemen were quickly disembarked.
The main task of the specialists is to put out the fire and to prepare the site for the delivery of additional fire-extinguishing equipment.
In the area of lunch, three additional paratroopers were taken to the village of the Hunting Helicopter.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the area of fire is ready, the specialists will be moved to the site of the carnage, and are posted on the website of the Primorsky Province Administration.
My father never hugged me.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry's rehearsing a comedy, "Soft Rudy records," which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew up in a series of radio 4 shows.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are happy.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, and Henry often pondered his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the form of a beer, the beauty of punching in cricket.
I've never spoken to him like that.
He was such a smug guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a lithing workshop in Dudley and, although the conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to see what his life must have been.
It's a bit better now, but it's a dark, smoky, depths of a labyrinth with fire and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father was getting in the bathtub and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to wash off the lithium shop.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing it for years and years to make us a living, and I appreciated it more.
Still, Henry got out of childhood without parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It was only when Mom got sick at the very end of her life that we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he needed when he was a kid.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, who he's been married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother himself had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
So I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to take a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's career shift is probably reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he got his critics' confession for his Othello, he's been completely in the theater.
Followed the "Fault comedy" and then the "Storages" of August Wilson.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedy, which were an inseparable attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in the factory.
DJ spotted him parading on the stage, and wrote about him in "The New Faces."
His TV career began in the middle of the '70s: "For a long time I was the only black parody/comic on TV."
He went to school at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on TV, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "The New People" in 1975
Since his manager had the right to the Black and White Show of Messler, a light entertainment program in which people "blacked their face," Henry found out he had been in it for five years.
My family didn't like it.
I kind of want it never to happen to me, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I was working on large sites and learning to work with the crowd.
But what was "the award-winning easy entertainment classical on British TV for years and years" was "the big black-people parody."
Presenting the characters who mocked the culture of blacks in the United Kingdom, Henry worked in an alternative comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of "Lennie Henry's Show" was aired in 1984, and in the '90s he was known, among other things, as Chief Gareth Blacklock of the "Sheep!" comedy show.
Advertising videos, documentaries, TV series, and role in films took over the next ten years of his life, but after his show on BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What are you gonna do next, Len, 'cause it's a little bit like you're dragging time or slowing it down."
And then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's Good in...?"
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a real allergie for Shakespeare.
You can't say I'm being taught that in high school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of the middle-class white people with the caps and the cabbage at the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Leicester, Judy Dench, said, "You need to try.
Don't swear it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines of Othello's last monologue for a document, and he got caught.
I had a feeling I could do it.
It's like my head's been fixed.
"This is what it is, it's a big deal, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little study.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we set it up.
And it was a success.
It looked like they had been waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the "Fault comedy."
Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical failure, and Henry instinctively felt that his business was to entertain the public.
"A quiet voice inside me said, "You're gonna have to work for 10 minutes while they're fixing the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my job.
I can let someone else handle it.
"You play in the play, stay in the role."
Henry's at the Duchess Theatre.
It was hard to learn the text for "the fences."
Panic's pretty useful, it's boosting the muscle.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign from the top, showing, "This is what you need to do."
He's saying it, of course, by a loud voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the rehearsal.
By the way, Henry's still thinking comedian - all the way to our conversation is interrupting the outbreaks of his humor, and when he starts, he stops imagining.
I just decided not to work at the stand-up, because this thing with the instant payout from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you keep trying to do that, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work at the Apollo Lives when I want to, but, mostly, I don't get as much fun as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever give the stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the start, the middle, and the end of the road - I don't think I'd ever want to give it up.
So this is his new embodiment?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and this is the perfect place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is registering civil servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya began biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid are reported in the Government application.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after they have left the public service.
President Uhuru Keniata has promised to reduce corruption in government structures since coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month was lost by payments to “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that wages continue to be paid to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusiri, from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants are required to report to identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected by means of a biometric registration procedure, as reported in the Government ' s application.
Anyone who does not do so without a valid reason will be struck off the payroll, as reported.
“This procedure will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of the Government - thus putting an end to the problem of “invisible workers”, said Ann Weigur, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for Planning and Structure of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers have been arrested in connection with a “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the Government”, reports local news agencies.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Huriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in last December in a corruption-detection exercise aimed at vetting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and tapping a phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic cleric Fathullah Guelen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer break.
This day has traditionally been a big event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yazenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told the expectant reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do his best to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony was not held in every school on September 1.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, the vast unified Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastukhov, headmaster of a school in Slavansk, to which Yacenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by the fact that children wear their shirts, hold balloons in their hands, and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, he may have found such an impressive leader she needs.
It is followed by a plume of fame from the world of banking, the media and the Tori Party's internal circles.
In fact, she has her own experience in senior posts.
Her career began at the Bay and Co Global Governance Consulting Company, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world in Pearsons.
She had been the head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring when a senior position in the Pearson's parent company was held by a male colleague who held a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are close to £1 million.
Its political ratings are also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of the BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former adviser to Tori.
Earlier in May, I named the work of the president a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two orientations: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but out as a voice of public concern and anxiety when something goes wrong.
It is an almost unattainable duopoly that requires complete radical reform.
However, what new president would risk coming by stifling and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he were to lose his own work in the process.
It's a hard decision.
It wouldn't be so hard, many people would be happy to see the BBC go down in size, after re-evaluating its powers, finance, and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of a license pose a particular risk to the BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British buy a share in the most definitely the world's largest media venture.
BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of the households and are only 40p a day for each of them.
Moreover, Beeb’s popularity is evidently growing: 53 percent support it today, up from 31 percent 10 years ago.
BBC's browsing and use patterns have changed: I now get headlines on my cell phone and watch the missing software on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive president - I hope it found him.
Perry from Texas says that the humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
The tweet from the confirmed account of the Texas Governor of Republican Rick Perry on Sunday night contained an offensive image of the D.A. from the Democrats, who is at the center of the criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another one from Perry's account, in which the record was disavowed.
I just got a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I've removed it," the later record says.
Assistants Perry did not immediately respond to the communications with a request for comment.
Although the records had been downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was actually publishing the tape.
The earlier tweet contained an ill-advised cartoon on the DA of the district of Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving under a state of intoxication in April 2013.
Perry banned the funding of her office when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a grand jury in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 elections.
The tweet says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of intoxication that is three times the allowable level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg office did not conduct an investigation involving a grand jury against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrume, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His strong law team had asked the trial judge to dismiss the indictment, stating that the law that was used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas's history was vague, which ran counter to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the state's State Public Control Department, which is based in Travis County, to pursue corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
Veto raised a formal complaint from a public control group with a left-handed view.
The feed of Perry's confirmed account is often updated - and sometimes become famous.
By coming to the fifth party convention in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to rumours that he might drop out of the game by tweeting a picture of himself running next to the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market is back to normal.
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in southeast England had "returned" to normal levels of activity.
Homes in the capital have been the subject of intense demand and fast-growing prices, with widespread fear that the credit bubble will push Bank of England to set limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Peejley, the founder and president of the elite Berkeley construction company, said on Monday, "Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013, "and this has provided a "stable working environment."
The London real estate market was successful during the recession, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the last year alone, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly exceeding the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for private, affordable and student schemes of Berkeley rose by about one fifth last year, reaching £423000 at the end of April.
But the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also halted the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “mansion tax” before the next May general election.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons last week warned that the April reform of the mortgage market, which had introduced stricter loan conditions, would also lead to a decline in market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Updated data from Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgages in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its forecast of the rise in London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent, based on the fact that real estate prices are already weakening.
In the meantime, transactions fell by a quarter over the previous year in the most expensive parts of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, the demand for houses in the capital was very lucrative for Berkeley, raising sales volumes above £2,2 billion.
Mr. Peedley added: "The demand for the right product with the best design and the best location has remained the same and, reflecting it, the sales have remained for a long time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year by the end of April, about a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, and the income rose by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, in front of the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Peedley said that Berkeley's expected income for the year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of the analysts, a profit of £450 million is expected for the whole year prior to the payment of taxes.
The value of Berkeley's shares was held at £23,96 in the afternoon at the London Exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence published online by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th annual American Film Academy Award.
Photos of naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar Award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a "catalogue" picture of another 100 rising stars.
A representative of the star "Hungry Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and he denounced the hacker for "invaded privacy."
The law enforcement authorities have been contacted, and they will pursue anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photographs originally posted on the 4chan photo-sharing site are alleged to have been derived from the lack of Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged “catalogue” of the victims of the break-in includes the names of dozens of women, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of these photos are real, although the star "Scott Pilgrim Against All" Winstead on Twitter also condemned the break-in.
"Those who look at the photos that we took with our husband a few years ago, in private at home, - I hope you're proud of yourself," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice, from the Nikolodeon "iCarly" and "Victoria the Winner", denied that in the photos, she tweeted: "These so-called pictures of me naked, people.
Let me stop it in the foetus.
Buzzfeed told me last Sunday that a representative of the pop star, Ariana Grande, had denied that the photos on which she was believed to be real.
Exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J" that lauded critics
They dissolved, and that's the best way to say it, they gradually fell apart, like the cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only at times did a woman tell him that he was too serious, hard to communicate, tense, closed, and perhaps a little irritating.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw the irritability in him.
He was stingy like a cookie, yes.
The last victim of this prank was a small novel, from which he expected more than usual to be freed from a lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some sort of satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a frightening, delicate, hair-shaped, heart-brighting, from a northern island village, even more remote and severe than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, who Kever thought was her aunt, the last of whom had inherited a house in a raw but paradise-like valley, the joyous name of which was "Paradise Valley."
No one's been in the house for years.
The pipes flowed, in the bathtubs, the spiders sat still, the slugs left their tracks on all the windows, confident that the house was theirs; the garden was full of weeds that looked like giant crows.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both frightening and charming, full of secret garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the Booker Lounge in 2014.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Kevern and Eileenn sat by the hands, in broken sheds of high grass, enjoying the sudden warm spring day; they both tampered with the cheap console, which provided the country with quiet music and comforting news, when, after glance at her crossed brown feet, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black performer, whom his father loved to listen to, casting the curtains in the house.
You've got too big a leg.
Because of their aggressive nature, songs of this kind were no longer lost on consoles.
They weren't banned - nothing was actually banned - just not lost any more.
They were helped to become archaic, as the word "archaic."
Public taste did something that would never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and just as people had chosen the memoirs of rich people who had grown up in poverty, cookbooks and love novels, they had chosen ballads out of all the music.
As a result of this day, Kevern began to play on the imaginary piano and a ruthless comical voice to sing Eilinn's big legs.
Eileenn didn't get it.
"It was a popular jazz piano song called Fats Waller," he said to her, mechanically putting two fingers on her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it went off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J," forgetting to put two fingers on your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It was not a very fun game then, and it was not very fun now.
He knew he was supposed to do it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileenn never heard it.
Jazz didn't play either, even though it was not explicitly banned.
Improvisation's out of style.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the tune started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with wit.
His unpredictability was getting on people's nerves.
And jazz was the wit of music.
Although he had reached the age of 10, never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kever knew about the jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Aileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembers the time when popular singers weren't black.
Again, no law or pressure.
The society was obedient, which meant that each segment of it agreed to the thanks - the thanks of those who had been spared - for the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean origin, temperament and physical characteristics, were well suited for entertainment and sport, and they sang and ran.
The people from India, as if they were naturally talented in everything about electronics, were trying to make sure that no family was left without a functioning electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish Diaspora was doing plumbing; what was left of the Greek was bleaching dishes.
The people from the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not rush out of the country, when, WHEN the world was going to happen, in fear of being accused of inflaming the flames, in fear, that the flames would consume them next, opened up restaurants with lavnaes and cliffs, held back, and swept for nothing.
Everyone's in power.
Since she had only heard ballads before, Eileenn was hard to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevin.
Unless maybe for people with big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved the song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him an illusion of security.
No word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant leaves that look like cabbage.
Eileenn didn't get it anyway.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on her lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head with distrust, shutting down the eye of Cavern.
There was nothing in the whole world but a corsage of her black-ass hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying in her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big a leg?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Ankles, maybe a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He might have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverted.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often made him uncomfortable because, like his father, he lacked the comforting charm that might ease the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he did, Kevin, too.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and rose from the shed, overturning the console and spilling the wine they had been drinking.
Wine from the buffalo, so the intoxication couldn't justify it.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a storm.
"And I like you because you have a dumb head," she said...
I don't like you, though.
He felt sorry for her and for the rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eye when she repelled him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in the main, she was like this place.
The same huge ice ocean fell on both of them.
The same distraught men, even more sensitive and presumptuous after what happened, if their ancestors, smugglers, and destroyers had gone roaming from the pub to the pub, ready to raise their hand to any woman who dared to refuse or tease them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she weren't careful!
First a kiss - the kiss is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballad that gave the console - to kiss her first and then hit her.
The overstatement, according to Kevern, was because the kiss itself was already a hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons' body showed that he needed to go.
He climbed out of the shed like an old man.
She felt the lead weight herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him go, and from the top window she watched him go, and her companion was a man who himself had borne the burden.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a need for compassion for him and for men at all, even though some of them had raised their hands on her.
A man who turned away from her, with his back bent, shy, scorched, all the power to fight left him - why did she think that she knew it so well if she could not remember a single case, until today, when she would see it?
Again, one Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the above-mentioned events or so on, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and vibrant 32-year-old researcher who worked at the Ofnau, the informal public mood control service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decrease if it did not stop at all, given the means and forces that had been devoted to its eradication.
"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "to soften the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in the thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these misguided branches and narrowly splintered terrain, where, despite the swelling over the hedges of the churches, the tender breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
However, some qualities have proved to be inexhaustible.
The higher the spire, the lower the passions it breeds.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows up stories of overwhelmed obstacles, and announces its ferocious faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only does the old rudeness maintain its strong grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is also evidence that new and vicious violence is emerging in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have a frustrating habit of writing too much," said her academic head, reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum put her head down.
I should also ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you gay?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I'm asking," finally said Luther Rabinitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We don't have any prejudices here.
We are the servants of the community without prejudice.
But some types of hyperresponsibility, completely acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, like the ones you've shown me.
Obviously, you're the one who's biased against the church, and what you call "vilest" and "gross," others would interpret as an expression of natural life and energy.
To continue to be bored about what was happening, if the world had been affected, as if it had happened, if at all, yesterday, was to deprive the country of the life it needed.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinitz was talking.
Behind his head, the pink letters, like flamingo, echoed the tips that Offnau had given to the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, value your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, say yes, apologise.
Talking is better than silence, the word of a song is better than a written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you're trying to say," replied quietly to Esme Nussbaum, when she made sure that her academic supervisor had finished talking, "and I don't want to say anything but that we haven't been cured as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I am concerned that, if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating the mistakes that originally led to what happened if the world was dead.
Only this time, we will cast our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinitz combined his fingertips in the pyramid.
This gesture was to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling `mistakes' the actions that our grandfathers had or had not committed.
You go too far and when you talk about them throwing their anger and their distrust on "others."
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that by understanding the past, that is, by protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" or "they."
There was no "us" and no "other."
It was a time of disorder - that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with herself," dared to put Esme in, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what's done is done.
It was then.
You don't have to say anything else, we agree here.
And as no one should be blamed, there is no need to justify it if it is appropriate or if something can be fixed.
But why the past, if not to learn -
The past exists to make us forget it.
If I can add one word to that -
The Pyramid Luther Rabinitz fell apart.
"I will consider your report," he said, releasing her.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who was on the sidewalk, as the passers-by described, "in an angry rage."
Coincidences happen.
The Lesotho Army states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The members of the Lesotho Army denied that they had been preparing a coup to overthrow the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police, who had been suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane left the country, claiming that the country ' s army had surrounded his official residence and had taken over government buildings in Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with an attack on his life.
The army spokesman, Major Ntléle Ntoi, said that there had been no actual coup, but that the army had responded to the threat from the “political fanatics” that the police had tried to arm.
“What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action by receiving a number of intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of the political parties that were ready to cause chaos,” he reported to the American Voice.
A South African government spokesman, Clayson Moniel, said that the army's actions looked like a coup.
“Although no one has claimed to take power by force, according to all reports, the actions of the Armed Forces of Lesotho to date have the main signs of a coup,” he said.
The Army of Lesotho reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was quiet.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mottejoa Metsing manages the government in the absence of Tabane.
Thabane stated that he believed that he was under attack in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabana suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his united Government.
He stated that his actions had not undermined the Government, despite allegations of the contrary.
"Chelsey's half-defendant, Marco van Ginkel, will be holding the next season on lease in Milana, a report by Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he only went to the London Club field three times.
Let's recall that earlier, Milaan had leased from the Liverpool of the attacker, Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest rate in 13 months
Growth in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to popular research.
The last value of the eurozone's business index (PMI) on Markit fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed, and enterprises have been affected by the growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values went to the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will be waiting for the bank to make a clear plan to cope with the eurozone’s recovery, as well as the risk of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
It is suggested that ECB head Mario Draghi may later this week give additional signals that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the brake effect of growing economic and geo-political uncertainty on producers is becoming more evident," said Rob Dobson, senior economist Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of concern, as does Italy's weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth pulse has faded mainly from the industrial engine, Germany, as well as from Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence,” said Mr. Dobson.
The slowing down of industry is likely to add oil to the fire to analysts who are waiting for additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI had grown to 57,3 its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist of the IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing to say about the August business index of the eurozone's production sector is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: “The producers of the eurozone seem to find life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical strain - particularly in connection with Russia/Ukrainian - adds uncertainty to the still complex conditions in many countries.
This increased tensions seem to have hit the business - and especially the consumer confidence - and may result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said that "more and more like it," that the ECB would, of course, have to do some kind of quantitative mitigation, "although we suspect it will be limited."
The inhabitants of Mariupol will set up a chain of life against the militia
In Mariupol, until last week, it was quiet - no one rushed to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the people are horrifyingly waiting for the uniforms to arrive.
According to the Politologists, the separatists are breaking into Mariupol to get to the Sea of Azov - a town of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which was not previously part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupols had decided that the Ukrainian army, even though it would defend them, had a little force against the well-armed members of the NRD-LDC, and were about to help the military.
They're digging trenches, building roadblocks and reinforcements.
On the evening of Saturday, a number of thousands of people arrived at the eastern border of the city, standing there in a live chain singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same in the event of an attack.
The volunteers collect and transport equipment and food, collect drugs, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually shut down, and banks and ATMs are shut down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the horrendous grip of the school, as the children who have been in it still suffer
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, south Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day trial, which shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated on death in a brutal school.
Exactly ten years after the horrendous takeover of the Neslan school, in which 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, heroically survivors of the disaster warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the start of a new quarter, it seemed to be some sort of extreme evil.
The tragedy united the East and the West in a disgust, which in an amazing way then turned into action and hope for the future in the face of the worst of grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in the south of Russia to find some of the victims who had deceived death during the atrocities at school.
We have discovered amazing young people who have stood up to adversity, even though the memory of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is currently wreaking on Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now end.
The girl in the picture is trying to get back in the shelling gym.
It is recorded in a picture of a well-known Russian photographer, Dmitri Belyakov, when in one underwear he tried to climb back into the shelling gym after the mine exploded.
In the confusion of Hades, she was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There was a fear that both of them had died, but in fact they had survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't," said Hades.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few fragments left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist, to help people the way the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but of course it didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"It's happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it any other day.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dr. Gapoev was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture stays with her, even though the memory is a little blurred every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our misfortunes, and we are so grateful for the help that we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see on the Internet a picture of me climbing into the school window, I think that a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
The boy who ran through the hail of bullets, believing that his mother was dead
It was his first day in school (the Russians start school at the age of 7) and survived three days of captivity, hugging his mother, Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran, and on the way he saw the baby crying, grabbed the baby by the hand, and ran through the hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who had taken his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara got out of prison and was in the hospital with injuries on her feet, in turn thinking her son was dead.
After their reunion, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now the non-existent News of the World), where he was awarded as the Protector of Children from Barnardo's Premier Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I'd like to stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you that I've lost it in my memory.
I remember right after I threw out all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with the shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I was playing with in the yard that never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted, and a trip in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars have brought about the grief that he and his friends have endured.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who last week volunteered at the monastery.
I want to help so much.
I want to be a cop someday, and I hope I'm enrolled in the Academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 children were killed in our block, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence right after the takeover, just no kids screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I was telling our story.
I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, help us.
She was grateful to "Sheri Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Cherie and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat the borsche, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still think this world hasn't been a better place in 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and quiet boy, he's neither aggressive nor mean.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not focused on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym every once in a while and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning his back on us for hours.
No sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing out all his weapons and other military toys, and Damira's 17, he's taller than me, handsome, smart, and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the blast, and I got up on my feet, I looked back, and I saw hell all around me, when body parts were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, "Damir, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran.
So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
George Illin, 17
A boy whose shocking post-capture picture was the key to the tragedy in Beslan.
Rest: Surviving Beslan George Ilyin with his mom Fatima after the takeover in 2004 and right George today
His bloody face had a pattern of fear when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarity in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, was the principal doctor, took him to school on the first day of school before taking Vladimir's eldest son to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she remembered.
Not all alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia survived.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it was yesterday, some of the scenes of these days have been in front of me all the time.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The picture of Georgie (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember George so wanted to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of crying Georgia in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our home.
I understand, but I also think that this picture makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
George now says, "It's important that it never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never find out the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what caused it?
This world is coming to something very bad.
"I can't figure out how this is happening, 'cause if you ask people, no one wants war, because it happens?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
We need to go decades to forget her a little bit.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares over the takeover, but now I'm getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym every 1 September.
I want to pay a tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to the University of Medicine in Vladikavkaz.
I'll learn to become a cardio surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but I didn't get any health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
George Farniev, 20
A boy who survived even though he was at the feet of a killer terrorist
Impossible: George Farniev was at the feet of the killer terrorist during the capture, but he managed to survive.
During the hijacking, he was photographed in the gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer terrorist.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We think it was yesterday," said Georgie, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but failed because of the damage to his health during the hijacking.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are easy to deal with bad things - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the following year, it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I passed out.
I'd never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: George Farniev today with a photo of himself on his laptop at the hospital after hijacking
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as my physical condition is concerned, I'm well.
I need to be careful with the knee that's been damaged, but right now I'm walking well.
Still, my health prevented me from going to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent out my files, including medical records, and they said it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to veterinary.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I'll never tell my children about my experience.
It's not something children should know about, and of course it's not what they're supposed to be going through.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark it.
I know George won't go.
For him, it must be even stronger, because he was there, and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me, and here in Beslan, the fingerprint is on everyone.
He stays with us.
George's a grown-up, but he's still having this nightmare.
It's hard to accept when something so awfully unjust happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had a number of surgeries, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he's 50 percent overwhelmed this nightmare, but you can't completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will stay with us.
A lot of friends and neighbors were killed in the hijacking, and it only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and loved.
My son is with me, and it's the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw it in the hospital.
Now I'm looking at what's happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
War is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure a lot of children have already been killed in Ukraine and a lot will be killed.
If we could grab all the rebels and get rid of them, as far as we can.
Alona Tskaeva, 10
A baby who was taken to a safe place by a Special Forces fighter
Saved: Alena Zkaewu is being taken to a safe place by a Russian Special Forces (left).
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember a monstrous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when Little Alena carried a Russian cop out of a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, her ten-year-old sister, Christina, and her brother Mahar in the school gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, escaped, but Alenina's mother and sister died in a deadly slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, had been remarried since then, and he and his new wife, Svetlana, had a little daughter, whom he called Christina in memory of the daughter he had lost.
Alona, who is now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and blooms into a smart and life-loving girl, says the neighbors.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alona and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father, and he wants to keep them out of all memory when it's the tenth anniversary.
You can see why.
Half-defendant Shinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to the Dorthmund "Boroussia", noted that he was looking forward to re-entering the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous career event.
Of course, I'm very glad to play for "Borussia" again, - quotes Bild's words to Kagawa.
I feel very good.
It's full of positive emotions, and I look forward to getting back on the field in the form of "Borussia."
To recall, Kagawa moved to the MU from "Borussia" in the summer of 2012 for 16 million Euros.
However, he was never able to join the English club, having spent only 38 games in two seasons in the England Cup, scored six balls and gave eight performances.
A man charged with attacking a girl at the Pelican walkway in Fife
A 78-year-old man will stand trial on the charge of attacking a 3-year-old girl at the Pelican walkway in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at the Pittenwin crossing in East Newk.
The prosecutors said that Mr. Stewart was running his Audi Q3 without due diligence and attention and hit the girl, resulting in an injury.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt in the Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the King's counsel, set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel, and Holland won't hang out in Vladivostok.
A duty-free shop at Vladivostok Airport put up a sign prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders in the store.
No perfume, no vodka, no cognac.
The store decided that US President Barack Obama, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, Vitaly Clique, Julia Tymoshenko, Japan's Prime Minister, and a number of other well-known fellows would not be able to drink vodka, cognac, and perfume in their store.
And put a plaque on the door.
Obama had previously been barred from entering an even less accessible institution, the MGA Dietary Cafeteria, as reported by the website of the general restaurants.
Whether the American president ever dreamed of eating in a dietary canteen in Russia is not known, but the banners seem to be very smart.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the agraries
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev of Russia believes that under the embargo, Russian agrians should learn new technologies to produce the needed cheese from the buyers.
The Board was given during a visit to the Agrocomplex by the South Pacific Company.
The head of government also advised the restauranters to redirect to Russian meat, the quality of which is at an appropriate level.
The annual food import embargo has been imposed in Russia since 7 August.
Valentine Maslakov, the head coach of the Russian team, is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted training for the competition.
Our athletes have performed at their own level, citing the word "All Sport" by Maslakov.
Third place is confirmation of our high command level.
It's nice that the French, and even the Americans, have a minimal advantage over us.
We haven't prepared for this competition.
The season was over, and we didn't commit our leaders to the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we've been second at this tournament, but this season we've been re-educated.
The French, on the other hand, set up a capable team of 13 European champions.
They have not concealed their intention to win this year, which they have repeatedly publicly declared.
But even this composition of the hosts of the competition failed to confront the Americans.
I believe, therefore, that the Russians have come to such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order below the same Brilliant League.
Season over.
Of course, athletes no longer care about the result, much less in team-level competitions.
The main thing was the place.
And as a result, I agree, it was absurd when at 1500 meters men were so passionate about the tactical tactics of the race that the result was lower than the average... of the women's races.
4 hints to improve the quality of underwater images and videos
If you want to take a picture or make a video underwater, you have a number of hardware options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a watertight "silver", for example, the Nikon Colpix AW120, or an action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures at the family holiday with a couple of cameras, all at a cost of about $350.
No matter what kind of equipment you use, there are a number of rules that need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Recheck your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight cell, make sure the cell battery and other compartments are closed tightly.
In addition, set up your camera for the kind of picture or video you're going to be filming.
Some photo and video cameras have camera or object-type modes that optimize the display for darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump in the water, figure out how deep your hardware can sink.
Some of the cells are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's management and digital camera ratings for both traditional and watertight models.
Take a few shots, because most of them won't.
The mints have a VCD that will help you compile the images, while the action cameras don't usually have them.
Even if you have LCD, it's gonna be hard to see underwater, and the frame layout will be a random process.
So make a few frames.
Also, if your camera has a series mode that shoots a number of frames with a little bit different displays, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The number of light drops significantly, the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you shoot in the pool, the river, or the ocean.
This will also allow you to pass more colors on the photos; the deeper you go, the smaller the color you see.
Draw closer to the target.
It's a good tip for a land shoot, but it's even more important underwater due to darkened light conditions.
It's particularly important if you're filming an action camera: this equipment is often fitted with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you're gonna have to get close to the camera if you want to fill in the frame.
The 2012 Bilal Mahov Olympics Bronze Priest can move into the Greek-Roman fight.
This was reported by Sazeed Sajid, the main coach of the Dagestan team for the free fight.
He did not exclude the athlete from the World Cup in Tashkent in September 2014.
At present, Bill Mahov is at the gathering of the "Classics" team, which is quoted as "R-Sport" by Sajid Sajidov.
In fact, Billal's grandchildren also performed in both styles.
At the 2005 world's youth top, he was the winner of the freelance tournament and the third prizer in the Greek-Roman competition, and decided to focus on the free fight.
It's been a long time since we've been talking about a new stage of our career, our heavyweight, in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll tell you more: Mahov can already perform at the world championship in Tashkent - if he wins the outfit.
But the final word is always for the coach's staff led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose personality might have shaken things up, even in a huge organization like the National Health Service.
He was an anesthesiologist, who devoted his career to riding the sick of both the suffering of the disease and the agony of the treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife remembers him, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that as long as doctors are interested in diagnoses and diseases, those who are being treated are mostly concerned about something very different -- pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who started to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
In his struggle with symptoms like the flu, he found that he resented his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to go faster, not later," he pointed out.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found out that he was unusual and unimaginable about why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a co-worker to get a chest X-ray.
Only two weeks earlier, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The X-ray results are back.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the plevre, or the pulmonary shell.
For most cancers, it's hard to figure out the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all people with lung cancer have smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbest, fibrous building material, which was once called a "wraith," but which is now known to be fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the United Kingdom since the 1960s, when the industrial recommendation ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only people in specific sectors worked in close contact with it: pipe-sizers, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But this calm is wrong.
The United Kingdom is now at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
Here, mesothelioma kills more people than any other country on the planet.
At an annual death rate of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die of the disease as from car accidents.
Annual mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are experiencing its deadly effects now is that, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), mesothelioma tends to take decades to develop.
And the attack by mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial engineering.
Asbest was, and in many cases stays, in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we go shopping in.
As a result, mesothelioma ignores class, wealth, profession, or age.
The Bastions of Choice, from the fancy London supermarkets to private schools, did not prove to be a salvation.
The House of Parliament is infested with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have proved to be the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a trumpet insulation.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with the asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It looks like there might have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's hospital, where I spent six years internment," he wrote.
All the students, the nurses, the doctors and the transporters used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question that, unfortunately, he might have given a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who had been interned at the Gaia hospital and who had subsequently developed a mesothelioma over the past five years, "he said in a letter in 2010, "I'm the one who survived."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with a mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
It's not natural to live so long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die eight months after the diagnosis.
It's always fatal.
So now we can just repeat the question of Lawson, "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to the lead mesothelioma expert in the United Kingdom, Professor Julian Pito is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the British asbestos epidemic is expected to survive, about 900,000 people will die.
Most people don't think they're gonna die like that right now.
Asbest mine in Quebec, Canada
A quick look at the records from the courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma’s attack has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they had misunderstood Janice Ellen's exposure to asbestos.
She worked online for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, directing dress departments at two sites, one of which was the main store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbest.
It never occurred to me that it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They had their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a fibrous structure that informs them of strength and flexibility.
Of the six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler sutures, even in the brake pads of cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that could lead to death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there are strong, though indirect, grounds for believing that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of mesothelioma patients [in the United Kingdom]”.

Janice Ellen may not have thought of himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Pito suggests that her history is far from unusual.
He carried out a study of the patients, which suggests that “a significant percentage of mesotheli is likely to be caused by the exposure of the environment to asbestos when there is no known impact on the work or the home”.
Most of the impact, he says, is due to the "normal use and impact of the weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which addressed the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the very center of the government, may have been unwittingly exposed.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and the pipelines behind the parliamentary committees had been contaminated with asbestos, the fatal fibers of which could have been driven by something as harmless as “severe air streams”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems to be true.
Although the Directorate of the Maintenance of Parliament insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “pure health certificate”, it now recognized that it was necessary to work for £1 billion in the renovation of Parliament by improving the electricity and removing the asbestos, and that, after the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might meet at the QE2 conference centre nearby, rather than at the Westminster Greenbeds.
The Goddard report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed in accordance with different regulations”.
It is not possible to know if this management error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to detect their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, he suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at the hospital, which was successfully sued for asbest," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009 when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late at night.
All of a sudden, I started to get feverish.
It started very fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wouldn't be able to make it all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming out of the plevre, the shell around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
Eventually, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took x-rays of the chest and put in pleural catheters to extract the liquid from the lungs and send it to the tests.
Still, his condition was undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was in sports and breathing hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients went to his hospital with similar symptoms, and was later diagnosed with a mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was tens of years older and worked directly with the asbestos.
The connection in this case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and the doctor consulting him showed the results of his C.T. and X-rays to the team of specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel ill, the camera sensor was injected into the cavity between the casing of his chest and the casing of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just moving on," he says.
I didn't worry too much about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year's, "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed by mesothelioma
All of a sudden, Abbott went into meetings with the Macmillan nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
"Asbestos appears to have been widely used, particularly in large public buildings, where thermal insulation on pipes was very common," he said.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from the disease.
So mesothelioma is now affecting younger people with atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients will be affected.
But many of the staff who went through the pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basements (as Graham Abbott often did) almost certainly had been exposed to a toxic substance.
For decades after the war, it turns out that the hospitals were a place where, in theory, they saved the lives of the people, but a place that was a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolmates set up their Bunsen burners on the asbestos pads.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestus was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls because of his amazing insulation and fire-resistant properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in the class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, the school children placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos pads.
Websites have emerged that highlight the problem of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, harmless things, such as floor tiles or roofs of barns, tend to contain asbest.
"It's an industrial poison set up in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against the Gaius hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden barn in the 1970s.
So watch out for the garden barns.
The effect of a diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a lot of time to find out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to go out and deal with myself.
Well, I won't see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the shift from a doctor to a patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information that needed to be taken.
"It was hard to understand," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it is the mechanic of how we support life - the act of breath - that causes cancer that kills.
Most mesotheliomas are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos breaks down and the fibers inhale, they can be trapped in a pleura, a pulmonary shell.
Asbestos fibers irritate the plevre and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises from the inhalation of needle-cut asbestos fibres,” by Professor Tom Treger, cardiothoracic surgeon, who came to the Gaia hospital in 2001.
It's the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, ironically, now leading a mesothelioma treatment center.
The coach knew Lawson and treated some of the others who might have been exposed to internment at the hospital.
When the needles of asbestos fall into the tissue of the lungs, Treadier says, "the breath of the needles pushes them to the periphery where the shell is.
This is, in essence, an invasive process from the start.
Normal treatment options for other forms of cancer are far less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is arousing a heated debate.
Some feel it's worth a try.
The coach disagrees.
"No way to cut out the plevre," he says.
There's no way to get around her with a knife.
In the meantime, this cancer is "not very good at chemo," which is "acting," but not curing.
"Sometimes there are sick people who live long," says Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Happily, some patients live much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, had become a single support and counseling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Rock Central," he said lively when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six rounds of chemo, which would take four months to extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "became to make things a little more colorful."
After meeting with a number of experts, Abbott decided to continue the treatment with Professor Loick Lung-Lazdunski, a professor of thoracic surgery at the Gaia hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a line, I just called them, and they accepted me," admits Graham.
The average patient would have to receive a referral and approval for funding.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to get the best available treatment.
But when such treatment is finally inefficient, many patients face another financial cause of concern - the future of the families that they will leave.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It was known that asbestos had been harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what's changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small amounts might have put health at risk.
That's when the company's bad faith was said.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-value settlement," according to Morgan, because Lawson was unable to prove clearly that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbest at Guy's hospital.
After an investigation of his death, the representative of the Gaius hospital confirmed, however, that “the bench in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, tying a fatal contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually tens of years later - has proved to be a major problem for mesothelioma patients.
Many of their former employers had changed ownership or closed down.
The insurance records may have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that they have no time on their side, of course.
In response this year, serious new legislation has emerged that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the Act, a £350 million fund, funded by the insurance industry, was set up for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but no one to sue.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could have awarded in the ordinary compensation case, about £1200.
Some 300 successful suits under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, as many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by the insurers for the insurers," he says, insinuating that the sum is a quarter of what the insurers would have had to pay if the time had not interfered and the Mesothelioma patients would have been able to track down the companies and file a claim in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “improved.”
However, both Penning and Morgan recognize that while seven people die every day, quick action was needed.
"People suffer so much, and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of the Bill of Mesothelioma last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lung-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapies, a tri-therapy, in which Lung-Lazdunski can boast 40 percent of the survivors in five years.
Abbott was feeling a surge of strength.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some kind of power that's backing you up.
When you give up, it can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went to surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six chemotherapies.
The next scans did not show any sign of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots in my chest.
I was about to turn 50.
It's not a life-threatening thing.
It's the end of life.
Again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemo.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, the process is both physical and emotional.
You can think of practical things -- finances when I die, for example, or how to show my wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get the bad news, you get so gloomy.
We need to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls I had a disease that means I'm not going to be old.
They reacted in a very different way.
Tamsin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and a lot of people called us very quickly.
Ally was more tempered.
She didn't talk much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by the simplicity of the possibility of survival.
This disease carries with it (even after all Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not a threat to life.

Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health harm caused by contact with asbestos in the United Kingdom.
Global asbestos production has grown to more than 4,213,000 tons per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139,000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in the United Kingdom requires that all contractors working with asbestos be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is illegal in the United Kingdom.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the United Kingdom.
The Mesothelioma Act was passed in the United Kingdom.
A compensation scheme of £350 million has been declared.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in low-cost construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear to avenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to stand for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demand for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to start the long-awaited protests in the business district of Hong Kong, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the statement.
In fact, the decision of the All-China People's Congress allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't fool our expectations, but it still angered us," said the lawmaker Emily Lau, the president of the Democratic Party.
It's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's men.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
In defending China's decision, Lee Faye, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing the popular nomination of Hong Kong's leader for election would be too “chootic”.
Since 1997 when the British handed over control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to vote for the head of government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders had presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward, as it gave the Hong Kongs the right to vote directly; however, the decision also made it clear that Chinese leaders would continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a commission for the nomination of candidates strictly controlled from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when some of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong took place over the years.
A major part of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to shut down Hong Kong's financial area if Beijing does not guarantee a true universal right to vote.
On Sunday night, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise in the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “did consider the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can be taken only if all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other option.
It is with great regret that we report that, to date, every opportunity for dialogue has been exhausted and that the seizure of the central region will certainly take place.
The public authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing's statement for a few days, and security measures had been strengthened at the Government's headquarters on Sunday, with the involvement of the police and the barricade.
At the root of the riots is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The flow of inhabitants from the mainland increases competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and free speech, are beginning to weaken under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put Hong Kong's business power at risk.
"The protest they're talking about can cause a lot of economic damage, depending on how long and how many people will be involved," said the lawmaker Regina Ip, who's been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of hand.
It's an image that's bad for investment.
Chinese public media has also been reporting in recent days, in which Hong Kong democratic activists have been portrayed by subversives sent by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
American prom culture reaches university life: first-year students are offered to come on a private jet
We are happy to respond to such a demand by launching the British first lux travel service for current students.
In order to give a strong impression of coming to the university, the company also offers transport options such as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also claimed that the service was thinking about safety.
This service is the perfect alternative for students who usually have to transport their stuff all over the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping students this year reach the university with the minimum of effort and maximum luxury.
The representative of the company stated that, as the service had just been launched, the orders had not yet been received, but added that “students will start ordering the service in the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that, despite the need for students to pay £90,000 a year, it was still hoping to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever to make an excellent first impression, and the VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as being detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, the NSS Vice-President for Higher Education, said, "This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most of the students.
Many of the students who are going to start university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis, when available financial support in the form of loans and grants is failing to meet the fast-growing costs of basic needs before they can even begin to think about taking out thousands of pounds on some sort of simple entry to the dorm.
Feminist women raise the issue of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in connection with the murder of an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a shift in Internet conversations among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who had left comments had placed the gender over race when it came to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as the tensions in the Middle West grew and national attention was drawn, Perez saw the responses of white women, who had concentrated 100 per cent on race.
Compared to the reactions of black women shortly after the murder of August 9, a personal essay with headlines such as “the idea of Ferguson on behalf of a white woman” and “Feminism is not just about the oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there's a lot of people talking about white skin and privileges at this high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic for the crisis that we're facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so racially related, they felt they had to point it out.
For a professor of English at the University of Ohio, Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as “female problems” in the cultural field.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner, and get 150 liquor from everywhere," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are being attacked in their own country, silence is overwhelmed.
"Why is it safe for women to talk in public about relationships, but not about public safety?" she asks.
For black women, like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share those problems; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"In the 1865s and 1890s, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and this almost always stemmed from the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
Needed a white woman to back up the story to justify lynching.
From Hatteri's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white superstitioners, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and found that the struggle for the right to vote would only work for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in a basket of women's right to vote, and the blacks' right to vote was due later," said Hattery.
Looking back at this kind of thing gives us a clear idea why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women had won the right to vote in 1920, it had taken 10 years for white women to unite against lynchings in the Association of South Women for the Prevention of Litigation.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
From Mitchell's point of view, the rise of white feminist reactions to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminist women had had to deal with the problems that black women had had to deal with in several generations.
"I mean, it would be great if the activists who have this [conventional feminist] ideology take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The second-wave feminists, who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are beginning to see what that means.
A well-known white activist, Gloria Steinem, used Facebook two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, and published a sharp article by the columnist Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take a more active part in racist protest.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the views on racial problems that are very different in public polls - will be at the centre of change," Stynem wrote.
Although Steinem is vouching for a more intersecting feminism that includes both race and gender, her comments on race in America are still surprising to some.
Researcher Christina Somers of the American Institute of Business, the author of "Who Stolen Feminism?", said She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, are “more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem's remark about Ferguson contradicts the criticism she had expressed earlier.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, "The Watcher of My Brother" to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking young men, the anger of many feminist women, including Gloria Steinem, followed.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that promotes the front line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-west border of the country this year, immigration reform resurfaced - this time as a women's problem.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present the problem as important to women, it was just to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of workers are granted [men's immigrant] visas, women who come with them find themselves in a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are resonant with women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich's pork house is for sale.
The picture of the house on sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it showed a large pig resting in the living room.
It is sold for £120000, a separate home with a single bedroom on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was a picture of the living room of the home - a pig with a head resting on the couch.
The Real Estate Agency Connells reported that the pig in the picture is the homeowner's pet.
“The photograph was, however, misplaced and had already been deleted,” the company's representative reported.
In a detailed description of the home, Connells described the former assembly home as "a unique single home with a single bedroom."
Despite the fact that the agency had removed the picture from its website, it was still in advertising.
The sale of the home generated interest in social media, where some asked if the pig was sold along with the home.
A Russian tennis player, Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of the US Open, is a failed Carolyn Wozniatski, who believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to get to a new level, handing Vasily OSYPOWs out of New York.
How do you generally rate your results at the Great Helmet tournaments this year?
Of course I'm glad I won the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I did not have the stability, especially at the end of some games.
I'm, of course, upset right now.
I couldn't even get to the quarterfinals.
What challenges do you have before the end of the season?
After an offended defeat, I have a huge motive to get to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm gonna do everything I can to make it a good year.
The Asian series of tournaments begins in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth, former world champion Nikolai Valuev, offered to give GTO bonuses on entry to higher education.
He said that, in general, the standards would be the same as in Soviet times - people would pass the standards by traction, running, and other exercises.
Recall that the 12 Russian entities will begin implementing the GTO standards on their territory on 1 September.
I also offered to school students who had passed the GTO to give bonuses on their admission to higher education, I noted to Valuev.
For example, you can add some points to the EEG.
There are also proposals to give additional weekends to the employees of the enterprises who have passed the sports tests.
There's a new millionaire in the city of Harvey in South Wales after winning the lottery.
He's a lottery player from Harvey this month.
A search is under way for a new millionaire southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million from a lottery play on Saturday night.
The newsstand at Harvey's is a gold game for the second time in five years, and the last win was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful victor still needs to make a statement.
The owner of the store, Steve Forward, said that the winnings caused a big deal in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole town is talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought it might be a secret win.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the winners of the major prize last month, marking the end of a few successful weeks for state players.
Last week, the Canning Vale player became one of the five millionaires in August, following a huge $7.5 million win from Belmont just a few weeks before.
The winning couple had been playing for 20 years and reported that the wins had given them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mino-Economy wants to boost the growth of the market for electric vehicles
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce to the Government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, and the Deputy Director of the Ministry's Department, Oleg Pluichnikov, at the round table, which was held at the Moscow Motor Show in 2014.
The plan is a Government-mandated plan, one of the main goals being to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted at the end of September - early in October, says Plownikov, the proposed measures concern electric vehicles and hybrids - a road map for the development of gas-fuelled vehicles in Russia is already in place.
The plan (a copy of the report) is designed for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport need to be developed and how to promote the use and production of clean vehicles.
A report to the Government describing tax and customs support measures for electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a scheme of soft credit and soft lease will be available by April 2015; and proposals for lowering the price of machines, encouraging localization and building service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014 - 2015, legal and regulatory changes are to be made to facilitate the construction of the charger infrastructure (parking, refuelling stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials will make proposals to the regional authorities in the course of 2015 to also promote the use of clean transport - in the form of an advantage in traffic and parking, for example, and by February 2016 - and to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Environment and Development will include in the list of performance indicators for regional authorities criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support for the production of clean transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is still in the form of some 100 electric vehicles sold throughout the country in 2013.
In early 2014, the import duty for electric vehicles was removed, so sales will be about 500 grand, predicted by the Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But the five-fold growth doesn't make electric cars any more visible: in 2013 in Russia, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors has imported electric vehicles to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start the import, a company that focuses on corporate clients, says Renault's Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Russia, Nicolas Remiz.
Most of the other manufacturers of electric transport have taken a wait-and-see position with regard to Russia.
The development of electric vehicles is also available to Russian manufacturers - ", GAZ, ", but the output is small.
For example, in January and July 2014, according to ASM Holding, Autowaz released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the Director of Autowaza's Engineering Sergey Amanov, there will be no breakthrough in this segment...
The development of the Russian market for electric vehicles, in addition to the expensive machinery (those that are sold in Russia, on average double the equivalents of internal combustion engines) is hindering the inexperience of the charging infrastructure (fuelling units), and is being sighed by the CEO of the Autostat, Sergei Celkov.
Due to the high cost and low cost of electric vehicles in the next three to four years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicted by the editor-in-chief of the "Autorevo" Mikhail Podorozhanski, Zelkov accepts it.
On the other hand, automakers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the normal cost.
The Russian market for electric vehicles has good prospects, and the main thing is to create consumer confidence that “electronicity” is real; this will be facilitated, in particular, by the emergence of new charging stations, by the president of the BMW group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimma.
Such infrastructural projects are being implemented by, for example, the Rosseti State Company: a number of stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon be available.
Negotiations are also under way with other regions for the construction of a refuelling network.
According to the Director of the Department of Rossete, Vladimir Sofyin, the company believes in the market for electric vehicles and is ready to build gas stations all over the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of different brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a network company, is not allowed to sell electricity, and the possibility of charging electric vehicles is being explored.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure is to control the formation of a market for electric vehicles in Russia by removing customs duties.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it, extending the grace list is being considered.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and concerns all machines) will also support the market, but not as tangible as the customs preferences, Pankov believes.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sales of electric vehicles, accounting for 12% of the market.
Russia also needs incentives for autoowners, for example, to park free in the centre of the city (as already done in Moscow), I'm sure the Pankovs, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles along the marked lanes, which Russia does not yet have.
A private jet crashed in Colorado
Piper PA-46 crashed in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it died, handing over ITAR-TASS.
The survivors have been taken to the hospital.
The crash took place a few kilometers from the Denver Airport runway.
The causes of the tragedy are now being identified.
In Donetsk oblast, prisoners of the Donbas Battalion are being dealt with.
The punishers were surrounded by Ilowaysk.
They had been loyal to their own commanders, and dozens of silos had died under fire.
The survivors say that if they knew what the actual situation in south-east Ukraine was, they would not go to war.
One hundred and twenty-eight prisoners are lucky.
The Donbas Battalion's cartels were left alive after the "measles" in which they fell under Ilowaysky.
In the area of the army of the Donetsk People ' s Republic, the militants spent a few days de facto abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters reported that the ring could be removed from the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But just a couple of minutes later, the shells and the bullets hung from all sides.
"On the basis of the information I was given, we had a hallway, and we were allowed to go out," he says, "and so does the Deputy Battalion Commander, who has a call call for "Lermontov."
And when we went down to the bottom between multipole and Rednosel, there was a cross-fire with anti-tank guided rockets, with "threats," with rocket launchers of 30-millimeter, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
I had four cars in front of me and three cars in the back, and there were only two of them left.
An officer named "Lermontov" said that almost immediately at least 60 people had died, dozens had been wounded, and many had died later.
The survivors are now being treated by the people they come to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called “terrorists” treat them well, provide food, medicine.
While their own commanders defrauded them and condemned them to the right death.
We were simply betrayed, they say.
The column, the whole battalion, to be destroyed.
To the Donbass Battalion, like many of his friends, Alexei volunteered, for the Ukrainian news was reporting the atrocities allegedly committed by the separatists in the south-east.
This is where Alexei saw a very different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that a mortar attack was under way, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces,” says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
After that, I wanted to leave the battalion.
They didn't let us out of Ilowaysk, they said we were in a ring.
I've already made a deal with the commander, and the report has already written out.
We were taken to Ilowaysk from the pickup with Zurahov.
According to the prisoners, there's a 300-350 man trapped in the Cotla under Ilowaysky.
Now, some survivors have admitted that if the time could be reversed, they would never have joined the retaliatory battalion.
All the prisoners had been handed over by the militia to the DNR.
Everyone's gonna be vetted for war crimes.
The region has set up a food price control centre
A headquarters has been established in Krasnoyar province to limit the price of products in the region, if necessary.
A decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the provincial government, representatives of the executive branch and oversight agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural production in the province.
- Will Kyiv "Rosnefty" pay $140 million in damages?
The head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, stated that the company estimated the damage caused by the shelling of the Lisician NPP in Ukraine in the amount of $140 million.
He reported this in an interview with Spider.
"We estimate $140 million in damages and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government for compensation," said Sechin.
According to him, the upgrade of the Lisician NPP was scheduled to take place in 2014.
However, part of the factory was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting, no "borrowing rebels," but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
In addition, the technological oil inflated into the pipes is missing," he said.
Recall, on 18 July, in connection with the shelling of the Lisician NPP, the oil storage tank was burned down and the buildings of the two warehouses were destroyed.
The Lisican NPP is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, and the first stage of the plant was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the LSN is about 7 million tons of oil per year.
The plant is capable of releasing the fuel of Euro 4 as well as the batches of Euro 5 diz-fuels.
In March 2012, the oil supply to the LSN was suspended due to its loss.
At the plant, it was decided to start the repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisician NPP, together with other Ukrainian assets of the TNC-XB.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea launched a short-range projectile in the direction of the Japanese Sea.
According to the South Korean media, this was about 10:30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
As Interfax was told in the Joint South Korean Chiefs of Staff Committee, it is believed that the missile fell into the Japanese Sea after flying some 220 kilometers.
The ruble drops in the context of geo-political pressure
At the Moscow Exchange, the dollar rose by 3 cop to 37.15 roubles at the opening, and the ruble fell to the sling basket in a context of geo-political tension.
ETS tenders for the dollar started with transactions at 37.11-37.2 roubles/$1 in an average of 37.16 roubles/$1 in two minutes, which is 4 cops above the previous closure.
The euro was 48.79 roubles per euro, which is 3 cops above the previous closure.
The price of the battling basket added 3,5 cop to 42,395 roubles.
The United States dollar trades at 23 p.m. above the official rate, and the euro at 16 p.m. above the official rate.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He continued to be cheap and ruble, and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Now investors are already pre-empting the deterioration of the geo-political environment and possible new sanctions against Russia.
So far, however, it's more like an artificial hysteria that's spiked through the media, especially the Westerns.
There are not many options for imposing new sanctions on the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the punch basket.
The geopolitic background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, Russian indexes and national currency positions can be adjusted.
Orenburg Airlines will be suing Perfect Tour
Orenburg Airlines brought a total of 4.7 billion roubles to perfect-tour.
These are two cases that will take place in October.
There will be different judges to try.
According to Interfax, the first suit was filed on 14 August.
It's a little over 425 million roubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 7 October.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
It's 4.24 billion roubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 2 October.
Journalists in the Russian Union of the Touring Industry have been informed that there are different judges.
In July, there was information in the media about the debt of the “ideal-tour” to Orenburg Airlines in the amount of 1.5 billion roubles.
The CEO of the airline, Victor Zukin, speaks of a sum of 1.6 billion roubles.
The CEO of the Aeroflot, Vitaly Savelyev, calls an even larger sum - two billion roubles.
Twitter tried to be more interesting to new users
The Twitter microblogs tool changed the user registration process to involve new players more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This should reduce the number of microblogging people.
New Twitter users will now view a large number of recommitted accounts at the time of registration in order to make up their own reading circles.
The recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests indicated in the registration.
In this way, Twitter will automatically check the subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
That's why the user will have to hand-click the tags so he won't read those he's not interested in.
While users of microblogs had previously seen only the avatars of the recommended users, Twitter now produces a sample of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help impress the person.
This is the largest change in Twitter registration in the last three years.
Twitter has been active in modernizing the service recently.
This activity is particularly linked to the continuing efforts of the service to achieve cost-neutrality.
In 2014, the microblog service experienced a slower growth of the user base and a drop in readership.
The company is now desperately in need of more loyal consumer resources, which would have stayed a long time.
It is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.
A day of knowledge in Moscow will be lovable and rainy
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy all day long, report by meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow will be between 16 and 18 degrees, and in Moscow it will be between 13 and 18 degrees.
With cloudy, clear weather, the rains will pass, the wind of the east quarter will be relatively weak, just 3-8 meters per second.
Recycling programme resumed on 1 September
As of 1 September, Russia is resuming a car recycling programme.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As explained by the Head of the Ministry of Prompromgue of the Russian Federation, Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by the reallocation of support from other sources.
The programme will affect all vehicles over the age of six.
The amount of compensation will range from 40,000 per car to 350,000 roubles per truck.
Previously, Russia had a similar car recycling programme.
The main difference in the current project, the Minister explained, is that it is not only intended to dispose of the machines for a later discount, but also the possibility, if the car is over six years old, to buy a new one, with a discount on the old one's transfer to the Trade-in from the dealer, to Interfax.
Over 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal recycling programme, which was in operation from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
As a result, the production of passenger cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million (a plus 101.4 per cent as compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will produce a game on modern journalism
Game designer Nicky Keyes, famous for Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game on modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
The Keyes started work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact is now very well known.
A source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where protests are taking place after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has no name yet, will be the way in which information about stories affects their impact.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to take a picture of what's happening in the area where the police and the public are fighting.
A hero can take a different picture of what's happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police look like heroes, and the protesters look like bandits, the police will be more likely to treat him and let him go where a normal person can't go.
If he does not cover the events differently, his photos can turn peaceful protests into a massive rebellion.
The points in the game will need to be put on Twitter by the hero, where new followers will appear, if the photos in the game prove to be popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of the exit and the platform on which it will appear is unknown.
The case, however, published an image showing how an event can change depending on how a picture of it is taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Keyes, he explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but he originally wanted to dedicate it to events in the Gaza Strip, not to protest in the United States.
After he began to collect material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media report on events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game motivated by what had happened.
Nicky Keyes is an independent developer who produces web games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which talks about events in Keyes' own biography, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to tell homophobic parents about his or her relationship.
Geneteus is dragging Ukraine into the bloodbath
In an appeal to prepare for another “ten thousand” of the victims, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Valery Gueletei, is dragging the people into a bloody confrontation, as stated in the report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Geletheus, who declared “the completion of the operation to free the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great National War”, which will cost “tens of thousands”.
The level of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the post on his Facebook page - a subject for the study of non-military experts - is stated in a report by Russian diplomats.
They have difficulty believing that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “The Russian side has already threatened, through informal channels, that if resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
He stated, however, that the “Operation for the Liberation of the East of Ukraine” had been completed.
Perez Hilton deleted all intimate images of the stars and apologized.
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars have been terrorized.
The hackers hacked primitive passwords in iCloud (data repository) in smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
Not for long, really.
To recall, Jennifer Lawrence, an official of the Star of the Hunger Games, has already reported the theft of photos from her cell phone, and has confirmed that all the images that are “shining” on the Internet are authentic.
Perez Hilton, the creator of the same-name tabloid website, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her workmates for publishing their frank images, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
I haven't been contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to remove the candid picture of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," wrote a Twitter blogger.
However, all the candid images of the stars have already spread over the Net.

David Beckham crashed on a motorbike, fleeing the paparazzi.
It happened in Los Angeles at a turn in the Sunset Boulevard.
The British footballer got off with a bruise and spraining of his right arm.
Beckham got out of the tattoo salon, where the paparazzi was waiting for him.
Slipped from their pursuit on the motorbike, he failed in the turn of the control and fell down, writing TMZ with a reference to a footballer's close source.
As a result, Beckham suffered a bruise, a spraining of his right arm and a scratch.
Tony Stewart's crashing back on the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track had already ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tire exploded on 172 laps, ending his performance.
Stuart took his shattered car to the garage and then left without talking to the reporters.
The head of his team, Chad Johnston, said that 14 team members were upset, but now they're gonna focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I'd like to have a better try and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do better.
Stuart first hit the wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repair of the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty big hope of coming to the finish well," said Johnston, adding, "just failed."
Shortly after the second crash, Stuart's car was loaded on the tow truck, and the team was ready to go.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Spring Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver in a race on the ground in the North of New York State.
He decided to come back this week, and he had to win either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to take part in the stalking.
He returned to work in an investigation into a tragic incident that had led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had taken the road to express his displeasure with Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
No decision was made as to whether Stuart would be charged.
The three-time champ was greeted with loud screams and applause when he was presented before the race.
Started at the 12th position, Stuart went at the 1st 10 at the start of the race, getting to the 4th position.
Then at 122 laps after Bush's restart number.
Car 18 got off the trajectory on the way out of turn 2 and hit Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart went on, but he's back to position 21.
Sobchak and Wittorgan are having breakfast cigarettes with Guenetski in Odessa.
Xenia Sobchak and Maxim Wittorgan are now in Odessa, which the broadcaster has not failed to report in her Instagram.
True, one picture was very surprising and very confusing to the couple's fans.
The picture is taken at Zvanetski's.
"At the breakfast at Mikhalyc Mikhalych Zhenetski Maxim explains the instagram:) #odessa", he signed a picture of Xenia Sobchak.
But there's nothing on the table but cigarettes.
No coffee, buns, butter, etcetera...
The couple's fans thought Xyusha was smoking, and they blamed her for it.
"Whose cigarettes?, "Smoking kills!", "What kind of cigarette breakfast?", "As if breakfast, and on the table only the cigarettes))) ", "Xenia, do you smoke too?", agitated for her favorite followers of her blog.
Let's recall, Sobchak recently boasted of what a delicious meal Maxim Wittorgan had made her for the first time in her life.
"Happy is when you come to the house, and your husband is here to make dinner (for the first time in your marriage, but it's good. It's important that at the end of the dinner he doesn't say in the words of the joke, "that it should be like this every day," she said to her husband, Xenia Sobchak.
The picture shows that Maxime is making something with diligence, and the table is already full of salts and baked chicken.
Bulgarian prison officers held a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the old working conditions that had recently been changed.
Salary increases are also part of the list of requirements to be discussed with the Acting Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov.
During the month, the officers protested symbolically against the new schedule of work, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the Prison Service Union had met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, no agreement had been reached, it was reported to the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
The talks are ongoing, as the Head of the General Department for the Execution of Punishments, Rossen Jeliazkov, reported to the BND.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest by the prison union.
The Army Controls the New Thai Government
General Pruth (right) appointed to the post of Minister of Defence, Prait Wongsuwan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chang-Ocha, announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers of the country, in which more than a third of the posts are occupied by retired or retired generals.
The army received key positions: the Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chang-Ocha was officially appointed Prime Minister following the King of Thailand's formal approval of the appointment of the head of the interim military Government to the post.
A 60-year-old soldier who had taken power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup d'état of 22 May was the only candidate for the prime office.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
The army had previously appointed members of Parliament.
According to Prauta Chang-Ouch, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat ' s Government.
Officially, Praut Chang-Ocha will be a temporary premiere, as the military is planning to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there is concern that the military is trying to strengthen its authority in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
With the total paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties had been temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglik Chinavat.
Some journalists and public figures had also been detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army removed Brother Yinglik Chinawat Thaksin as Prime Minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, particularly in the northern part of the country, which has led to their success in the elections on many occasions.
However, many members of the middle class and the capital elite had joined the anti-government movement, which had virtually paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one's ever said it's gonna be better in the lettuce, I didn't promise you that, and the waitress from the new Palm brasser.
You have to formally admit that it is, but the mind and the stomach remain unswerving.
We all know for a long time, we say "Belgium" -- we mean media, we say "Mids" -- we mean "Belgium."
Restaurants like to say in depth that the success of an institution depends on three factors: location, location, and, once again, location.
There are places that are not good, but even good, but bad.
So, when I sat down at Palm's table, I remembered that there was a City Café (after the same TV show), then an Odessa-Mommy, and a restaurant called "God" and a "Friends" beer.
It's a beer again, but it's not nostalgic-soviet, it's Belgian.
There was only the tip of the iceberg above the ground: a bar and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space without even a hint of sunlight.
But it's fun like in the children's room: red, yellow, and green walls, multicolored chairs, instead of windows - TVs, where girls are swimming.
Belgium’s establishments in St. Petersburg are no longer new, so there is a lot to compare with.
There are eight types of spilled beer (260-300 roubles per 0.5 litre) and countless bottled beer (170-1550 roubles).
A companist-positive waitress has a fun presentation of the menu, telling us that "Mids are full of big seed," and it should be noted that service, despite some disadvantages, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but is often very unexpectedly executed.
Well, who, for example, is supposed to know that a meat loaf with a Walloon prune (280 roubles) is actually a carpaccio, cut so thin that perkament paper will look uglyly fat in comparison to it.
You can only taste a taste if you warm up the poultry.
It's worse with the salads.
Classic leash (260) is the right thing to do to make it a crime against the Belgian people: some slurred iceberg that was once cooked a long time ago, swollen Kenyan beans, decimated bacon chips, and something marooned onions.
You don't want to meet anyone with a lettuce like that!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If the unripe chunks of cherry tomatoes or overcooked champignons could still close their eyes, why do the mice look like they've been defrosted and cooked a number of times in their lives!
I already know there's a perfectly normal white-sea mould here!
They're served in pots "in the sauce for your choice" (490-560 roubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen soups, the one from white wine, celery, and carrots, didn't work out.
Vegetables are there, but no flavor, and whether there was wine, it was still a mystery.
Well, they're good at moths with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken water here is not a sour, so thick, that, depending on the mood, you can decide the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice butter soup.
The rabbit was said to be cooked by a local cook in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On the other hand, the situation was diametrically different: rosemary overwhelmed it all.
It seemed that the rabbit had been fed exclusively to rosemary bushes in his lifetime, making the meat so incredibly aroma.

The dollar has risen to over 37 roubles on the news of new Western sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
By 10:29 a.m., Msk grew by 26.9 kopecks and was 37.02 roubles, and the euro rose by 30 kopecks, up to 48.73 roubles, as shown by the Moscow Exchange.
The currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and was worth 42.28 roubles.
Prior to the Crimean events, the dollar peaked on February 19, 2009, at a cost of 36.43 roubles, and on March 3, 2014, it was 37,005 roubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The relaxation of the ruble is long-term, in pairs with the euro, and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term prognosis presupposed this mark, says Senior Analyst "Alpari" Anna Bodrova.
Anything related to Ukraine will be reflected in one way or another in the course.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumours about the military incursion have not been confirmed on any side, but the market has been very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to that kind of news was struck yesterday.
The week is forecast to close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, the price of oil is weak, the policy, the sanctions, the problem of the transit of gas through Ukraine are all the links of the same chain.
Inflation is also projected to rise, with 5 to 10 per cent being added to current autumn prices.
There will soon be an end to seasonal vegetables and fruit, and there will be a vacuum as the nets shift to other suppliers.
"The dollar went to the 37 rubles mark, passed it, and returned, some powerful hysterical, no," comments the head of the Market Analysis Department, "Opening the Broker," Constantin Bushuev.
They will still see if the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The Ruble, he said, was severely weakened after the tax season was over, followed by news on Ukraine, and the CB last week stated that it was moving completely to the floating rate by the end of the year and was not taking any foreign exchange intervention.
When you look at the day-to-day swing, it's not different from the previous one this month, and it's just the 37 rubles that scared everyone, the analyst continues.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful has happened.
The turbulent times for the currency market were, I recall, when late in January there was an increased demand for the currency, as well as the third March, when the CB sent a record number of the currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of weakening the ruble.
First of all, it's an increase in the revenue from export transactions, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through import cost, says the Chief Analyst of UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.
The travel of imported goods and services is a negative aspect.
The sharp swings in Russian currency have significantly reduced the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, led to an increase in inflationary pressures, and, as a result, led to an increase in the cost of borrowing money, which in turn impedes the development of the country’s economy.
With regard to the stock market, the depreciation of the rouble is somewhat lessening the drop in the price of the equities expressed in the roubles.
For example, the MIFB index fell by 1.67 per cent during the tendering on Thursday, and the RTS index lost 3.27 per cent.
This significant difference in the relative reduction of indexes is due to a loss of more than 1.5 per cent of the rouble during the day.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy a currency.
As practice shows, the emotions are gradually obliterating, and the rubles are either partially or completely restoring the lost positions.
"We believe that we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency at the level of 36 roubles to the dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
A genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
The British woman reported that she had spent many years thinking that she would die after a misdiagnosis.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teens thinking that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had the disease of Charco-Marie-Tut, a group of hereditary disorders that cause nerve damage outside her brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosed is a common problem among people with HMT because so little is known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are believed to have MTSs that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, unsure walking, and squeezing toes.
Patients can feel numbness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progressing, which means that the symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the attack by Friedrich, a state for which the prognosis was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be chained to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and die before she was 30.
The mother of the two children, now 51, said, "I knew as a child I couldn't do what the others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I've never been able to skateboard or skateboard with any of the other kids, and I've been bullied a lot at school for walking and running.
Rogers said that, when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked in the medical records when her doctor left the room, and it said that she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn't, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about that condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked, and I experienced the worst possible panic.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that space.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she had realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and had asked her doctor.
He just got up, hugged me, and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease, because you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something that is a much less life-threatening thing.
After a couple of genetic tests, she was found with a CMT.
"When he explained what a MIT is, I thought I'd pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The British HMT Charitable Organization announced a month of information about the HMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
The tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area is increasing as the economy recovers
The recovering economy means more clients, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies all over the country increased moderately last year, when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area - no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia combined to pay $27.6 billion to the state and local treasury in fiscal year 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the $21.6 billion collected in 2012.
Last year, the tax burden on state and local business increased by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after the years after which the accounts fell, in 2009 and 2010.
State tax increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local tax, 3.9 per cent, according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district tax revenue, 56 per cent, is taxed on business, while 36 per cent of Maryland tax revenue is from firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, generates the lowest tax revenues, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to the return to the old value of real property in companies, according to researchers, which raised real property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 per cent.
While large states, such as California, New York, and Texas, account for a large share of this revenue, the same seems to be happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia have combined to pay $10 billion in real estate taxes for the state and local level last year, an increase of $9.6 billion over 2012 - a 4.2 per cent increase over the previous year.
However, the observed return to real property does not have any similar effect on the rise in state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real property taxes are just over one fifth of the company's tax accounts.
Virginia and D.C. companies pay about half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real property taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around D.C., belongs either to the government or to a non-profit organization that does not pay the property tax," said Douglas Lindholm, the executive director of the State Taxation Centre.
So Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from business cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Business income also appears to be improving, according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion of corporate income tax, most of it in the region.
While trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three districts.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was the same as the national average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth rate in Maryland was much faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (one with the same corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is relatively high at 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower taxes on state and local business and, in general, a more favourable environment for business tax than Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from her neighbour from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law that reduces the corporate rate from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, as in Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continued to meet its tax revenue targets next year, the law could have raised the rate of income tax for business even to 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime, small business in the Washington area seems to be feeling better and thus paying more taxes on the state and at the local level, according to a recent study.
Taxes on entrepreneurs paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners - a transitional structure for most small firms - in Columbia County, Maryland, and Virginia rose by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business tax revenues is likely to continue this year, with sales tax in state and local governments rising by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington zone may lag behind, as lower federal spending is affecting the region's labour market.
The Bronze Age of the Russian Judo
The Judo World Cup brought two silver and seven bronze awards to the Russian team.
By this indicator, the Russians have only given way to Japan's major rivalry.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk began on Monday, and the first day brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
It was owned by Beslan Saganov, who was in the category of up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the equal final fight against Boldbat Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation had resolved one comment that had been received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian team - three medals were won on Tuesday.
In men's competitions, up to 66 kg of silver was given to Mikhail Pullaev and bronze to Kamal Khan Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian gave over to the 2011 and 2013 world champion Masashi Ebinume.
Han-Magomedov, who had lost a fellow countryman in the quarter-final stage, had won the comforting tournament and had been awarded a bronze award.
In the women's tournament of up to 52 kg, Natalia Kusutin also reached the third stage.
In the semi-finals, she lost to the current world champion, Mailinda Kelmendi, from Kosovo, who was a member of the International Federation of Judo and successfully defended the title.
In the argument for the bronze, Kusutin won Ma Inan from China, but after finishing the tournament, she admitted that third place was not what she was hoping for.
Once again, Kelmendi, who had won Kusutina earlier in the European finals, was a barrier to the Russians' journey to gold.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the Russians put bronze in the back of the Russian team, which was in the category of up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, he was abused by a former Moldavia representative, Victor Skovortsov, who is now a member of the UAE team.
But then the Russian won the two contractions and became the winner of the award.
Magichkov performed at the home championship with a drumstick injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will pause in the competition.
As for ex-Moldovan Svortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal at the tournament.
Interestingly, another fellow member of his country who had accepted UAE sporting citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, with bronze, finished his performance in the category of up to 100 kg.
On the fourth day of the CM-2014, the Russians also received one bronze, which in the category of up to 81 kg was won by Ivan Niphontov.
In the hard fight of the small finale, he was defeated by the opponent, Alan Schmitt.
On Friday, the tournament was played at the same time by three sets of awards, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to a single bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
It was held by Kirill, and the Russian team was guaranteed this medal: his competitor in the comforting finale was a fellow countryman, Kirill Denisov.
However, the contraction itself did not take place: the opponent of the question was unable to reach out to the Tatami because of the injury.
The man's bronze was conquered by the hosts, and on the sixth day of the competition, Renat Saidov, who was in the category of more than 100 kg, put it in the pool.
In the comforting finale, he won a pure victory over Brazilian David Moura.
That's how the individual part of the world's primacy ended.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the world's championships were played in team competitions.
Both Russian teams, both male and female, were among the main bidders for the award, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex had been unlucky - they had not reached the Medal.
But Russian judoists have won command silver.
In a decisive stand-up, they gave way to the top winners of the competition, the Japanese team, in a hard fight against the score 2-3.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after the pure victory of Khan Magomedov and by the will of Denis Jartsev (up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories, the Japanese rivals were unable to cope with Murat Habachir (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiyev (100).
In the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament was developed, where the Russian team, at 2-0, gave way to the Japanese 2-3.
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was present at the teams in Chelyabinsk, who, after the tournament, congratulated the men's silver team.
"The second place is a very honorable one, but I want to say that it was clear that you might have been the champions," said Putin, whose words put the RIA "News."
To lose to the Japanese, to the judo-heads, there's nothing shameful about it.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
Russia's team at the home world championship was much better than it was a year ago at a level like that held in Rio.
At the time, the Russian team had only three medals, one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Aarsen Galstian and Mansour Isaev Olympic Champions.
We're all, of course, big maximalists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember, if a person in the Olympic cycle is in the 8 best, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
In a sport like judo, the Russian Minister of Sport, Vitaly Mutko, summed up the results of the tournament.
Japan's team was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of different dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will take place in the summer of next year in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her arrival at the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed her hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
"Thanks for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in the statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday, following an urgent call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopie, reporting to the sources.
The doctors deliberately keep her under narcose and strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “heavy”.
The response was wide, including numerous Internet support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripe.
The Kings will be able to do it.
The band's debut album "Royal Blood" is a new hope for British rock, which brought rock duets out of the clubs straight to the stadiums.
Duoth Royal Blood is only a year on stage, but has already been nominated for the BBC Music Award, the Arctic Monkeys opening tour, and a visit to the New York dressing room from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut single album received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before the release, and the contract for its release is in the Warner Music's major label.
In view of the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is a huge one, since it is not about the new lana Del Rey or another sweet voice representative of the "new R'n'B", but about a duo of British-like bulls playing with the volume and intensity that was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes for the first album for all the above-mentioned circumstances were particularly high and had already been fully justified.
It's not for nothing that the duo had taken a name that might have been invaded before, except for the most desperate, hairy metallists, and the blood of which the kings, they think, are flowing in their veins, too.
This is, of course, first of all, the heroes of the past level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood is intended to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, leading it to a new height.
Prognosing the success of this business is probably a bit early, but something can be said.
A dozen songs in 30 minutes is not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composing talent as a credible and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of individual numbers cannot, of course, be denied: let's say the pilot single "Out of the Black" is a drum party, not a melodic line.
The musicians joke that it's even easier to rattle than to sing.
A powerful "Little Monster" and a closing record of "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title is also worth highlighting.
The truth is, however, that each of these songs will sound great at the heavy rock party, but when they play in a row, they combine into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it's not necessarily bad, even the other way around.
Royal Blood's power is that they don't claim the credit of the new Lennon and McCartney's (previously scheduled to be the successor of Motturhead), but they've taken a lot of rock-duettes out of the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, is made for stadiums, in a space designed for less than a couple of thousands of people, and it is evidently narrow.
Part of the secret is to use the bass, which replaced the guitar in a common format that was invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
But it's not just the tools, it's the way to write songs.
The heroes of the Zero Retroroc was hard to move beyond the postmodern paradigm, and they were very reluctant to accept themselves as independent creative units, not just epigons.
Royal Blood is already sounding so powerful and insolent that this impulse has successfully emboldened some of the repetitiveness and hardness of the music.
And in the end, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: an online store and a video producer, and a hundred other things, buys a Twitch streaming video service for $1.04 billion (US970 million).
This was not a surprise because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a good billion looked complete, and that was a natural combination.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a flowing service of a general nature, the YouTube version in real time.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their inner-game moments; "YouTube for real-time games", according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos where all-famous (mainly old) games are processed like "The Mystery" is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch has been met with no special interest, a classic example of a well-established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that, according to information, he was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from the executive director of Twitch Emmett Shear: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us to achieve them faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who say they're gonna do better sport than watch it, find it hard to see the attraction of watching games instead of taking the joystick in their hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she crawls through the Resident Evil, and a very different thing to watch some outsider get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them, without controlling the angle of vision on their own, can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speeds in which the Rogers Bannisters of this e-century finish all the games in record time are entertaining.
But if it's not a virtual game or a humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will ever be interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and this is the fourth-largest source of high-end Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon make it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch will go to Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could just absorb Twitch.
But Twitch has something that any company would love to get: a crowd of young men that advertisers dream about.
As the head of Twitch Shire, Amazon, and Twitch said, "both believe in the future of the games," and this channel does not show any sign of oblivion, even - oh - as a spectacle sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, died as a result of the 2004 terrorist attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to the surviving hostages - almost all of the students now, to the parents of the dead, to the cemetery keeper - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the committee of Mother Beslan, Susan Dudieva, who took part in the special operation by a member of the MES, says Elizabeth Antonov, a correspondent of the Department of the Society, who was working on a special project.
Upon his return to Moscow, he met Aslambek Aslahanov, who 10 years ago was the president's adviser on the North Caucasus and had talks with the terrorists, as well as with the FSB's B-officer, Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What's particularly shocking me over the time I've been working on this subject is that Beslan is like it hasn't been in ten years.
It's a very painful subject for all who have anything to do with it, and people can hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job,' said Antonov.
A special project was developed by Rambler & Co's Infographic Holding Studio, which has been working for the company since spring.
Previous special projects focused on the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's reign.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea launched a short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile in the waters of the Japanese Sea, reports the Ren Hap.
The launch took place around 10:30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
It is assumed that the rocket landed in the Japanese Sea, flying some 220 kilometres, and reported to the Joint South Korean Chiefs of Staff Committee.
The deputies proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative is successful, the Russians will not be able to store them on servers abroad from 1 January 2015
The State has introduced a bill to reschedule the date of entry into force of the already adopted Law on Personal Data for Russians, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based in the lower house ' s legislative framework.
It was sponsored by members of the State Duma, Vadim Gollin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeniy Fedorov (Union Russia), Vladimir Parahin (Just Russia) and Alexander Jushchenko (CPRF).
This change, in the view of the proponents of the initiative, will help to ensure more quickly and effectively the rights of Russian citizens to the preservation of personal data and to respect the secrecy of correspondence in the information and telecommunications networks.
The Act, which is rushed by parliamentarians, requires Russians to keep their personal data on the Internet in the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, organize, store, store, refine and extract the personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located in Russia, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of Russian personal data law by a court decision.
The Act also proposes the establishment of so-called “blacklists” of offending websites, an automated information system entitled “List of violators of the rights of individual data subjects”.
This law was passed by the State of the State in the summer.
The draft law was drafted by Andrei Lugowa and Vadim Gollin of the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of the RCDF.
Money and Yushchenko are also among the sponsors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who don't have data centers in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent.
Commenting on the bill currently submitted to the State Duma, the first head of the Douma Information Policy Committee, Leonid Levin, stated that he saw no problem in moving the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that will not have their own Russian personal data repository in the Russian Federation by 1 January 2015 will be able to rent them, for example, to Rostelecoma, who has repeatedly said that they are ready to rent their servers and are already providing their servers, to Mail Group, to Western companies that are already providing their servers.
"In addition, there are a number of independent data centers ready to cooperate in this field," he added.
“If the companies decide to implement the law and continue working in the Russian Federation, I see no problem - they will have the technological space for accommodation,” Ljewin summed up.
Disputing Bill
Immediately after the bill was published, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that, if the bill was passed, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
These include online booking services for airfares and hotels.
In the view of the association, “the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data, making it imperative that their record-keeping, systematization, etc. be ensured only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement stressed that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of the location of the record, to systematize his/her personal data.
In such a case, it will be possible to choose the territory in which the said actions will take place.
The adoption of such bills to “localize” personal data in other countries has led to the loss of global services and significant economic losses.
A member of the test with a bucket of ice water twisted her jaw
Isabelle Roberts, from the United Kingdom, screamed like that when ice water was poured out on her head, damaging the bone structure of her face.
This test with a bucket of ice water went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so hard during the test with a bucket of ice water that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so fervently when ice water was poured out on her head that it damaged her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I was yelling, but when I was doing it, my jaw started getting stuck," she said to The Mirror.
The water is flowing to a 20-year-old.
Isabel Roberts seconds before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but it didn't close, it was stuck, and then it came to me that something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister got the same understanding, and they started to laugh, but I had to be taken to the emergency room right away.
A 20-year-old woman from the United Kingdom was taken to the hospital to fix her jaw after taking part in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The video became an Internet-sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The U.S. military handed over more than 400 prisoners
In the Army of Novorossia, they claim to have hit the Ukrainian Su-27 and accuse the opponent of violating the cease-fire agreement.
As at 10 a.m. on 1 September, 402 prisoners had been handed over to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom had been wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
Interfax was informed by a representative of the press service of the Army of Novorossia.
He added that “by means of air defence in the area of Mereska, Su-27 aircraft was shot down, in violation of the cease-fire arrangements”.
According to the Agency ' s interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions when shelling Lugano airport.
The Spokesman noted that the militia had been able to damage two Ukrainian air force helicopters in a night at one of the field airfields, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
“The casualties in the opponent's life - up to a hundred dead and wounded, surrendered to thirteen men,” summed up the staff member.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the “people's republics” of Donbassa announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard in the framework of the cease-fire.
At the same time, at night, the DNR army, according to the Army of Novorossia, “stopped an attempt by the National Guards to remove heavy equipment from the area, in violation of earlier agreements”.
At that time, the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in a short-term combat, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total loss of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) during that night was five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, and more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers found themselves surrounded by militias in the Ilowaysk area of Donetsk oblast.
Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has asked the leadership of the “people's republics” to release Ukrainian troops from the environment.
In the DNR, they agreed to do so on the condition that the enemy handed over the weapons and ammunition.
The first dozen soldiers began to leave the encircled localities on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion, Donbass, Semen Semenchenko, an additional 14 people left the Cotla on Sunday night.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity to the 137 regiments of the 32nd Division of the Russian Federation and the 9th Panzer Brigade of the Russian Federation" where they are treated well.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of Russia have denied the reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO of the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MFA: Russia will respond if the EU introduces new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take measures to protect its legitimate interests in the event of the imposition of new anti-Russian sanctions, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A report from the Russian Foreign Diplomacy Department states that the “convictions” of the European Council of 30 August have demonstrated the inability of the EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their unspeakable support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in the east of Ukraine, on the basis of “absolutely unsubstantiated allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of that country”, as stated on the website of the agency.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation deplores the fact that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member States, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as for a full “dialogue between the warring parties”, underscores the agency.
The agency's website also notes that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbassa, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has taken place, as well as an increasing number of civilian casualties.
We recall that specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation are planned for the next seven days in the European Union.
At the same time, EU representatives are working closely with American officials.
It is expected that they will correlate the measures imposed by the period of operation and the degree of stringency.
New EU sanctions can affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an expansion of sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Strict ways to save on university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students is over $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon be in second grade, has come up with a clever way to cut the cost.
He developed a system of how to rent books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My textbook on math, which is usually $180, I got a term for $10 and a cookie for "Chick-fil-A," says Schroeder, who is 19 years old at the College Covenant in Georgia.
The necessary literature for the last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent 120 dollars.
According to the College Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and teaching materials, but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet stores and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
The rent of books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book for a semester, and is often much less expensive than buying it.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that book rents have doubled since 2011.
Industry studies show that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores during the last spring semester were leased, says the vice president of Nibo, Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookshops, according to the professional association National Association of University Stores.
Here's an introductory course on how best to make a good deal.
Online shopping
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see at the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematic Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler is about $290 on the market, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the website of Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of books.
Purchase of used
If you don't mind someone's mark or injury, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematic Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in second-hand form on Chegg.com.
Matt Kasaday, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigam Young University, says he paid 42 cents for Amazon.com for a second-hand copy of the textbook "Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business of Advertising."
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers such as Ingrid Bracey, the director of the College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, asks students to ask their professors if they can use the previous editions.
Sometimes updates are not relevant to classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small proportion of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to the websites Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular option for the purchase of used books.
Rent
If you want to rent a book, you might want to think, if you treat it well enough, remember to get it back, and you don't want to keep it after the course is over.
You can save over 80 percent of the cost of the new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a "Mathematic Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you pick up the books, including any fines that you can get for notes, accents, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember, if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
Electronic Books
Electronic books, instead of traditional textbooks, are another option.
At times, such books are leased by e-licensing for a certain period from the distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" on Chegg.com will cost about $61 for six months.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the best prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, while literature in natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look around.
Joe Galt, 29, who is about to start at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to check the price of the book, as it guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering on the Internet, Galt says, make sure that the book is in the warehouse.
It was not easy for him to learn.
The delivery of the book he had purchased was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin stated that the Far East Development Fund was completely inefficient
Russia’s president, Vladimir Poetin, said at a meeting on the control of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, was inefficient, reports Interfax.
"15 billion roubles remained on deposit," stressed the president.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested that the approval of the list of pre-development Territories in the Far East be expedited.
He recalled that the draft law required for the establishment of the TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this fall.
The Federal Assembly, noted the President, never approved the list of pre-development territories in the Far East and their criteria until 1 July.
Vladimir Putin also set out the main challenges for the development of the Far East.
These include improving the region's transport accessibility, removing infrastructure constraints, both in the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create preconditions for attracting additional investment to the region, as well as to create pre-development areas that need to become competitive with the key business centres of the APR, the President stressed.
We recall that it was previously reported that the pre-development area could replace the NEO.
Why Watch the Galaxy couldn't save the cashier's fees
Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million out of her $90 million budget in the United States, while Sylvester Stallone returned only $12 million out of her $70 million budget.
"The Home Video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films like "How to tame Dragon 2" also disappoint the profit.
The Telegraph article by Robbie Colleen points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be about the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colleen called 2014 the "worst" year in the history of children's films, and he called "How to tame Dragon 2" a barely "functioning" continuation of Fantasy.
However, when it comes to films that target a slightly older audience, it does not seem that the problem is necessarily the movie itself.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film, which was leased in the summer with at least 2,000 copies between the May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of both the viewers and the critics, suggest that this year's film yield is similar to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that this may be about changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services, such as Netflix.
Directed by John Favro, who is currently working on the soon-to-rent Disney film "The book of the jungle" said to Hollywood Reporter's website, "I think times are changing."
We must accept that and not try to pursue what was before.
In contrast to the current drop in cash charges in Hollywood, Netflix's income from the streaming replication service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and foretelled Hollywood's "crack."
In the light of the current recession, some commentators claim that there was a share of truth in his gloomy predictions.
In view of the fact that a number of potential cashier hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including the Avengers: The Ages of Altron, the Minions and the Jurassic Park, others in the film industry are more optimistic.
The producer of "People of H" Simon Kinberg recently called the drop of the cash levies just "cyclic," saying to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the most cashier summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Productive sanctions do not frighten the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants in Europe and Japan, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
Generally speaking, the common market still prefers to replace banned imports with products from Latin America, Israel, and China, not from Russia.
"Better there is a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella," lamented the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of the cheese that the suppliers offer him in return for the Italians.
Mozzarella and the burrate cheese ended at the restaurant first, and they have a short period of storage.
Parmesan supplies should be enough for a couple more months.
What do we do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Roadmill market.
Mariano Valerio makes such an eye that it is clear that shocking memories do not let him go until now.
There was meat on the carts just 30 centimeters from the floor!
It's cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant, we'd never buy anything in the Russian market.
I don't know, maybe it's changed now.
But the other day, I was given fish from the Far East for a test.
So it turned out to be bad!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio marvels that many of the usual things for Italy are for a Russian producer in wildness.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hanged in a chiller for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It's got to hang out to be soft, so the muscles can relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get this tender meat?
I said, it's yours, Russians!
Why don't you guys do that?
At five minutes of walking from the Barlotti in the French restaurant Brassery Bridge, the kitchen has a stop-list showing the missing foods: the French oysters, the seafood.
The chef of the Brassery Bridge restaurant and the Arrow bar, Régis Trigel, is less pessimistic than Valerio: the oysters from France have already replaced the oysters from Tunisia, and the restaurant will buy Swiss instead of the French cheeses.
And Régis is getting more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Blue cabbage: 200 roubles!
I'm like, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make money too."
But this cabbage shouldn't be worth more than 80 roubles!
We buy long-east oysters by weight, but they live 15 to 20 years, you know how much their shell weighs?
The price is that it's super-delicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of terror for foreign cooks.
The standard story is, "The first three months were good, then quality fell."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibre and quality.
A lot of restaurants in Europe don't know what's gonna happen to them when they're out of cheese.

The Respondent Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures for Russia's security, mostly called food sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and co-products from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurts, tomatoes, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have started shopping with suppliers: food prices have risen, and there is an urgent need to look for analogues from other countries.
This will have the greatest impact on expensive restaurants with monocookies in France, Italy, Spain, where the products were delivered directly from the “materian” countries.
The general public had to be rebuilt before.
For example, when Rosselhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef in early 2014 and a year earlier the import of American and Canadian meat.
In return, the suppliers made deliveries of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer 2014 sanctions turned out to be far more severe.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved the amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout, lactonous milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for planting.
The Italian man Valerio hopes that the sanctions can be relaxed.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to East West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the proportion of imports in the bonus segment was up to 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries produce, "says Sergey Mironov, the restaurant owner of Restconsult.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few cooks like this, and it can take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from Brassery Bridge is ready for this: 10 to 15 percent of the dishes will have to go down, half the menu will have to be reworked.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, foods, such as marble beef steak, are already being replaced by beef stroganes, says Sergey Mironov.
"Cyres from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Chile, Tunisia, Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of East West.
The cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the United States can be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, a salmon and a seed from Norway, a salmon, a semgo, a trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of European vegetable and fruit production can be offset by the production of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
Mironov's view is that budget online restaurants will be more easily rebuilt than the bonus segment: it is unlikely that gourmets have been there to distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Though it's hard for Ginza Projects, he thinks.
Ginza Project has dozens of restaurants under different brands and menus.
It's gonna take a lot of time to replace," says Mironov.
In Ginza, the comments were rejected, citing the absence of owners in the country.
The owners of the Caucasian and Central Asian Cafés stress that the foods from the former Soviet republics are more flavoring than the European foods.
But there are a lot of restaurants that the sanctions are not going to touch.
These include institutions with the kitchen of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive foods in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the "Wai Me!" Café.
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, which is the basis of many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic greens we don't use."
No dishes have yet been removed from the menu at the Colossians.
Timur Lanski, the owner of Chichon N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchens, the sanctions don't bother, but he'll only have to change lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia were to import from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we would even win the price, it would be cheaper for us than it would for us to import from Europe, he said.
You can get cheaper cuts, lambs, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fruit.
However, what comes from Central Asia is much better than the plastics from Italy, Spain, and Turkey.
We all know about Uzbek tomatoes that they're delicious, sweet.
No one speaks of Spanish like that.
Following the imposition of the sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of the Environment of Uzbekistan, Olymboy Artikov, said that he was planning to double the export of fruit-bearing products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan declared their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of the sanctions.
The fast food restaurants that responded to the "Deneg" request are also quite quietly responding to the sanctions.
McDonald's Press stated that localization was over 85%, and the network was working with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of Subway Russia's supplier department, about 80 per cent of the product is being purchased by the network in Russia, although it may be time-consuming to supply vegetables and to increase the price of meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In the “Tremke” “sanctionary products” were not more than 4%.
The sanctions and the Vocker noodles have not been affected.
KFC, Burger King and "Child Potato" did not respond to the "Deneg" request, but others claim that Burger King is much less localized than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, the restaurants are ready to buy more Chilean than Russian Far East
On his buckle
For the time being, the moratoriums have complained that, due to the increase in demand, prices are rising even for local products.
“The average price for Grabley's products rose between 10 and 15 per cent, and for the Italian restaurant "Cerry Meo" doubled,” says the restator, Roman Rochnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of the dishes will rise by 5 to 10 percent, admits Kolbay.
East-West does not deny this: “For example, Belarusian dairy products have been 10-15% worth of money since the beginning of August.”
"The Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork," complains Sergei Rak, Deputy Director General of Stardogs.
Chicken ham traveled 35%.
Waiting for China's prices, maybe they'll cool off the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a scheduled price increase of 8%.
Now it's very unwelcome to raise the price,' says the cancer.
According to statistics, the increase in general service revenues in the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how fast it is: as long as most of the restauranters have stored their products for the next two months, in the hope of waiting for the swings in the purchase price.
But what happens in two months, no one knows.
In front of the City Hall of Moscow, there are ten tents decorated with green and tree.
In the center of the scene, the musicians play waltz.
It's a regional food festival with the fun name "There's Time."
"We've been planning to make a local food party a long time ago, "and here is the sanctions, "we rushed, we set up a festival," says one of the organizers.
At the stage with the musicians, the Greek cook Anastas cooks a macaroni salad and homemade candy, and there was a master class the other day to make a brew with caramelized apples.
All of Russia's products, tell the organizers.
In tents, an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian people's economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, reindeer from Salehard, vegetables from the wet-mosced Lenin Supper, cheeses from the swamped Italian Jay Clouse.
"A fish for restaurants can be easily replaced by another fish of salmon from the Far East," says the owner of the fish store "His people," Philip Galkin.
We've got nerks, whales, cucumbers, boobs, chalices - "king salmon."
Yeah, they're not as fat as the Norwegian salmon, because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it in your hands, it doesn't even move.
And you can't hold our far-east salmon.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic
In the window of his tent are shrimps with a tag called Magadan, cod, omul, muzzle, meadows from Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's time to go to fish from the Far East.
Statistics show that fish catches in Russia in 2013 are more than 4 million tons, and that a significant proportion of the fish go to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
It's been working since 2012, selling fish via an Internet store, serving a dozen more restaurants, such as "Simple Things" before the sanctions were imposed.
Now, there are 15 more restaurants that have applied to Galkin.
The same sushi can be made of our fish, he's hot.
We've had a bit of trouble, we've tried a lot of prescriptions.
Now we're selling sushi over an Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish are a few times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 roubles per kilo.
As a confirmation in Galkin's tent, I'm getting a shot of Philadelphia with a whale.
In contrast to the semblance rolls, they have to chew longer, but the realization that this fish is ours, the national fish, is a source of strength.
There's even halibut rolls and seabug rolls on the website of "My People" magazine.
In sushi bars, it is true that the replacement of the Norwegian salmon is preferred to the Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains this because cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes for long-east fish.
"The Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," explains the owner of the Killfish Bar Dmitri Eusev.
The situation is similar to that of other products: Russian producers could have taken up the vacated niche, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the Lavka Lavka project, Boris Akimov, it is now possible to talk about the substitution of imports from Europe and America by imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large multinational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace banned imports as opposed to our farmers.
That is to say, the ban will benefit first and foremost the major producers of other countries,” says Akimov.
In the last month, however, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of mass unplanned checks, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are studying the nature of the claims made in order to determine the actions required for the early opening of restaurants for visitors,” stated “the money” in the McDonald's Press Service.
No one really knows what's gonna happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, it is one option that can be survived, an anonymously speaking employee of the restaurant consulting company.
But if they start closing McDonald's all over the country, the script will be very different.
"Europrotocol" in place of HIDB reference
Casco payments can be received without the help of the GIEACPC, so the CB will encourage the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed draft guidelines according to which, as of 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to do without a certificate from the Department of Public Health.
It is true that this is only the case when the accident was filed on a "europrotocol" without the involvement of the road police.
So if there were only two cars involved in the accident, there were no physical injuries, the damage did not exceed the limit, and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
Since 2 August, the europrotocol limit is 50,000 roubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad, it will be increased to 400,000 roubles.
The point is, often even in minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be handled by a “europrotocol”, drivers who have been involved in an accident call for a DPS.
After all, if there was a casco policy, it was not possible to obtain compensation for it without a GIEACPC certificate.
The parameters set out in the draft directive are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of a “Europrotocol” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for a casco for an accident in which no HIDB staff members are involved should not be lower than the limit for the “Europrotocol”.
At the same time, however, it cannot be above the limit set out in the Casco Insurance Contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the DPS and the roads.
But it probably won't make the motorists or the insurers happy.
The latter already speaks of a serious risk of an increase in fraud, which may result from the introduction of new rules of payment for the casco.
As far as drivers are concerned, it is hard to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver will, in most cases, wait hours for an inspector to take care of a minor accident, because it's more reliable.
And we don't know if it's gonna be easier to beat the crooks or to convince the drivers of the reliability of the europrotocol.
Saving certificate will make name and irrevocable
The Minfin wants to ban bearer's savings certificates, but will allow banks to make them the equivalent of irrevocable deposits.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing a bill that will ban the bearer's savings certificates.
This instrument has recently become more popular, as the stakes here are higher than those on bank deposits.
The fact is that the bearer's savings certificates are not included in the deposit insurance system, and the bank is less expensive because they do not have to contribute to the Treasurer's (AEC) fund.
The picnicity of the situation is that this step is to be taken by small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, but will be affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to the ASB, control 98 per cent of the relevant market.
The Bank of Moscow is estimated to account for about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASA, is that the customers of a small bank who have bought such a certificate, if their license is withdrawn, are trying to get money from the ASA.
Some depositors, with insufficient financial literacy and savings certificates for bearer, may assume that their investments are insured.
A well-founded lack of insurance for these certificates, if the bank's license is withdrawn, may lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.
In the practice of the agency, there have been cases in which bearer certificate holders have sought to recover insurance through the court,” the ASA stated.
The problem, of course, is inconceivable.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of the certificates, as they have no legal right to compensation from the State.
If the instrument had not been insured by the ASA, it would have also banned metal accounts in which the funds of the citizens were recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts are not included in the deposit insurance system, but their existence is not yet at risk.
The fact is, most likely, bearer certificates are a very convenient security that can actually be a quasi-denegue.
However, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any bank client can buy a certificate, hand it over to any citizen, and before the certificate is cashed, a large number of owners can change it.
It is no accident that the bill states that the savings certificate must be the name of the security document to be held by the depository.
And to sweeten the pill to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to pre-default.
That is, the analogy of an irrevocable contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
This weekend, protesters protested against the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was described as antisammit.
Stephen Fairklow was following the events for us during the weekend and spoke to the protesters who had come from all over, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will be supplying weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TASS, referring to the decision taken at the end of the meeting of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to send to Iraq 30 Milan man-portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it has been decided to allocate an additional Euro50 million to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will deliver a government statement in the Bundestag on the subject.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to the hot spots.
The views of the people of the Federal Republic of Iran regarding the transfer of weapons to the Iraqis have been divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea was hit by the militia
The Donets militia bombed a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TASS.
This was reported to have occurred in the Bay of Taganrog, near the towns of Chiroquino and Benomyno (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media have reported the shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is clear that the incident took place today at about 4:20 p.m.
Teens were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO youths were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went camping shortly after Sunday afternoon at Gowetts Lip in Blackhit.
The concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team, including local police and rescue teams, was sent out, and a couple were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell down and hit her head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they got up at the winch on Monday morning.
They were taken in an ambulance in a stable state to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two Unions Meet
The summit talks in Minsk did not resolve the problems for which they were convened but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian
Even on a worrying occasion (the situation around Ukraine is urgent), for the first time, EU and Customs Union leaders discussed a number of “hot problems”.
Whether such a structure can work effectively is not clear; however, it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
The questions in this regard fell off the night of August 26, when the Belarusians, followed by the rest of the Eurasians and the Europeans, saw the new president Lukashenko in the news.
The Belorussian leader set an example of a well-defined politeness, which was the behavior of the man who just hit the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival of the three main European commissioners (EU ministers) in Minsk, who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to address the final briefing on their behalf, is not just the legitimization of the 20-year-old president.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full subject of European politics and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior Analyst of the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies, Denis Melyantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to the Minsk tone in the same way as it used to.
"The fact that Kathryn Ashton met the Tet-a-tet with Lukashenko suggests that relations with the EU will continue to be defrosted," he said, "the fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for a breakthrough by the Belarusian authorities began well before the November Maydan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
“The results have also been achieved with the EU - successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization,” lists the Fire interviewer, and international security talks have been held with the US.
The States even lifted some of the sanctions.
With regard to the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reactions of the leaders of Belarus have only encouraged the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko was able to come to Belarus for talks.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure refused to accept Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in Donbassa with all its severity, did not have a fight with Moscow.
Minsk has not left the Customs Union or the CSTO, and the Russian airbase is stationed in Baranovic.
Brussels and Washington have observed a balanced view of the Ukrainian issue in Minsk, and they appreciate it, as the Belarusian experts are sure.
As the Lukashenko movement to political diversification proves to be successful, it will be evident how often Minsk will be able to host EU+TC meetings in the near future.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Kathryn Ashton was unable to respond quickly to the questions about what Brussels expects from the new format.
The Spokesman Ashton Maya Kosyančič merely said “Fire” that, in the context of the resolution of war and peace, the subject was not a priority.
At the same time, it was reported that Kazakhstan could be the next place to meet on the Ukrainian issue with the first persons in the new format.
A drop of degration for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he was personally asked by the EU.
At the final briefing, however, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties do not mind that Minsk remains the central venue for the meetings, both in the format of Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of heads of State and high-level representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” is gaining the status of a well-armed European leader who is helping to solve the global problem.
Best friend of a European farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Trade and Energy Commissions, led to the conclusion that the main theme of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbassa, but the economy.
Indeed, the meeting's calendar of future gas negotiations and to address the concerns of the TC countries under the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU is more ambitious than the peace declaration without a specific date or number.
The Trade Commissioner, Carl De Gücht, nevertheless pointed out that the EU representatives “came to Minsk to find a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences rather than vice versa”.
It seems, however, that in the economy the crisis in Ukraine “works” for Belarus.
Its consequences — and above all, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia — are being given to Minsk, who is currently experiencing the sanctions pressure, the long-awaited space for manoeuvre.
According to Mises, head of the Centre for Research, an ex-candidate for the President of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are keenly interested in the capacity of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation, bypassing the sanctions.
In doing so, supply schemes have been put forward, for which Vladimir Putin at the summit killed Minsk.
“The initiators of these schemes,” stressed Romanchuk, “the Fire,” are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have now been destroyed.
Russian business is in dire need of some way to rebuild them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is the fact that many Ukrainian companies are willing to produce in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarus's production and trade schemes can now be very needed.
Romanchuk believes that the role of the owner of the EU and TS talks is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic links with Europe.
He recalled that the loss of the EU agrarian sector from the Moscow sanctions was estimated at Euro5 to Euro10 billion, and the European Commission was currently offering only Euro125 million to the farmers.
The Belarusian president can invite Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for the Eurofarmers.
This can raise the EU’s credibility of Lukashenko to an unprecedented height.
Hostages without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk's active role in the birth of the TS+EC format is being disassociated, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague stressed that Kyiv was the initiator of the new format.
“It was your offer to come together, without any difficulty, to discuss, not from the bay to make a decision, after the signing of the Treaty of Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that was currently taking place in Ukraine,” he addressed the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.
The observers, however, interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which was said to have initially been opposed to the Minsk mediation, which greatly increased its political profile.
In the Belarusian diplomatic office, it is carefully emphasized that Belarus, in organizing the EU-TC interface on its land, has no self-serving purpose, and the ultimate aim of this format is to create a single economic space in the future, from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“It is in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, particularly in the area of security, have put forward and promoted the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation,” said “Fire” in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, an agency that has recently carefully chosen the word.
In Moscow, there may be pay-as-you-go zones
The Government of Moscow views the introduction of pay-as-you-go zones as a method to control the overloading of central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, by handing M24.ru to the Moscow Vice-Maxim Liksutov Transport Assistant.
One option that has proved to be successful is fee-paying entry.
It's an expert opinion, we're going to study it, look at all the negatives and the positives.
To say that some decisions had been made on the matter, not yet,' said the Lixuts.
Zamera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow in structure and complexity, is very important to the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the construction of the central ring road, added the Lixuts.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there was enough bypass infrastructure, there was no need for transit traffic in Moscow,” said the mayor.
Maxim Lixutov also claimed that the introduction of the parking lot had significantly unloaded the capital streets.
And, he said, the capital authorities don't plan to stop on what they're doing.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, participated in the booking ceremony for the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CADA).
Boring Sinable
Frank Miller's and Robert Rodriguez's film "City of Sins-2: A Woman for Whom to Kill" made a very wrong revolution.
The first "City of Sin" (2005), filmed with minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between the film, comics, and the literary noir.
The sequel is also in its own way revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental to modern thinking chain of "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" (as understood by the concept of the universe of the nuar, and the antithesis is the space of comics).
From now on, it should read "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
"City of Sins 2" is chaotic on both the dramatic and the philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in a bad way.
Yeah, some of the heroes know the first "City," although, here, the big man Marv (Mickey Rourke), remember, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, just got it out of time to pick up - in the role of this folk's maid - knives and other axes with strangulations.
But the old men are literally pushed out with the elbows of newcomers, as if they had broken into the city from some other movie, the meaning and the plot of which the viewers are asked not to worry.
So, his story, shamelessly shattered by the writers at the most interesting place, by the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Hers is the lustful-frigid Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for something avenging her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion in which, let's say, Dwight's face is not different from Johnny, especially since faces, like other parts of the body, are decimated with inexorable regularity, is not a problem or even half a trouble.
They're not humans, we know they're noir archetypes: a fatal bitch, a self-confidenced player who's been in the honey trap of sex, detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and an archetype, it's not a movie, but an abstract painting.
And it's funny to ask abstract art questions about the logic of the plot.
Besides, even in this turbulent world, there is something permanent.
Fighting whores from the first City continue to hold a round of defense against the shanty-bodied forces of darkness that besiege them.
And Detective Hartigan's ghost is no, and he's gonna look at the fire, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem with City of Sin 2 is another.
Frank Miller was good because as a drawer talentedly combined the comic book and the noir, and as a director, he turned the picture of how to move the comics to the screen.
Comics and Noir are two aggressively opposing "realities."
The contemporary comic book was born in the late 1920s, when the novels of Dashil Hammet "Blood Harvest" (1929), "Maltic Falcon" (1930), and "Glass Key" (1931) created a canon of nuar, then known as Hard-Boiled School.
Or pulp fiction.
The comedians gave Hollywood dozens of heroes, from the pope's sailor, the spinach eater, giving him rich power, Superman, Batman, and stinging Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, and all the other "revenors."
But in any comic book movie, there was something bad about it: painted characters persistently refused to grow up with screen flesh, remained pretending to be in the world around them, the world's "real" will.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of "existence."
On the other hand, the Noir is the most existential genre of world literature.
After world wars, the traditional novel - with experiences, character, family scandals, and history - lost all credibility.
What are the Forsythes, which Tibo and Roegon-Mccars, what are the Bolkons and Rostovs even thinking after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated the format of the soap opera, and the criminal - that is, the marginal - novel rose to the level of the philosophical prose.
Hammet found out in his skin what it's like to work as a paramedic on the front.
He was a communist.
As was, by the way, at least, close to the company and the genre columns of Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, the directors of Jules Dassen, Joseph Lawsie, Edward Dmitrick.
So the noir, the archetype of which they set, is, firstly, rude and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first "City of Sin" was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically linked the comic to the nuar.
For the first time on the screen, the comic had come to life with no shyness in his graphic nature, not pretending to be a real movie.
The dream of a corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered a murder, and the senator covered the monstrous sadist son, was well-deserved with Hammet's pen.
And the paintings are, like, cut off heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the brilliant James Elllroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best -- that is, the declarative nausea, the neonourist.
"City of Sins 2" is not even a retreat, but a surrender of Miller-Rodriges' radical style to the comic book tradition.
A lot of this must have happened because of the 3D technology.
When you watch the second City of Sin, you feel like you're incarcerated in a glass ball, in which the snow falls into a toy cliff.
Most of the time, though, it's not snow, it's blood shrouds, but in general, what's the difference?
Well, there's nothing to talk about about sociality.
After all, it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere we have, at times, on the side of the dirt swamp, but there's a normal world where you can get a girl who's gone down the road, or, say, to the distraught parents, that her killer is grounded.
But when there is no place for sin in the city but sin, then sin is no more a sin, but a standard.
Boring as any standard.
Chaos City of Sin 2 is just boring.
For the sake of justice, the national lease gave this fresh sin a small but pepper.
The titles warn us that the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In view of the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a man's toothbrushes his fingers, it gives him hellish humor.
Hammet would love it.
The socialists of France must “shut up and bring France to order,” says the key ally of Frassois Holland
Mr. Valle called upon the deeply divided left forces to “exercise the warmth” of the attacking socialist president, whose reshuffles had not been approved by the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay with him," he said, voicing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured him that his Government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the conflicting proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his fellow members of the Socialist Party to stay “single” with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the Minister of Justice, put the sticks in the wheel, coming to a meeting of dissenting members of the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost their faith in the future”.
Marin Le Pe, the leader of the extreme right-wing national front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not realize that the new Wall’s government would last longer than a few months.
François Hollande is a naked king, but a naked and Prince Manuel Valle, who is forced to gather a new government when the summer failed.
"And the new one won't last the fall or winter," said Miss Le Pen to the reporters.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was sure that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to run.
The ruling party of France survived the defeat of the March municipal elections, and the extreme right-wing national front came first in the EU elections in May.
A Sunday Journal du Dimanche poll found that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting up into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Holland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician at the University of Cyan's Poe, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
"The City Free of Drugs" is without a lawsuit.
The Sverdlovsky Court of Arbitration left the action of the Regional Department for the Administration of Public Property to the “City without Drugs” Foundation unaddressed.
The agency intended to collect more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rent for a building in the centre of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice.
Today, the Sverdlovsky Regional Court of Arbitration has dismissed the action of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the region (IGISO) against the City without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders is the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugenius Roysman).
The regional authorities intended to collect 7.3 million roubles from the organization as rent for the building.
It is now known that the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice, which is why the decision to refuse the hearing was made.
The reason for the absence of representatives from the IOGISO Directorate was not clear, and the Chief of the Legal Department, Maxime Titov, did not respond to the phone calls.
Nor was it possible to contact the Foundation.
To recall, this is a mansion that held a foundation in the centre of the city in Belinski Street, 19 on a donation basis since 2011.
This decision was made by the ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Department of Public Property Management of Sverdlovsk Region filed a claim with the Sverdlovsky Court of Arbitration for the removal of the fund from the building.
According to the action, the agency ordered, through a court of law, that the non-contained contract of free use be declared the home of the monument.
In the view of the IOGISO Directorate, the agreement did not contain significant lease terms for the cultural heritage.
The Sverdlovsky Court of Arbitration dismissed the claim, at which time an appeal was filed with the 17th Court of Arbitration, Permi, which was granted.
The fund then filed an appeal against the decision in cassation with the same court, which failed to give effect to the decision, after which the decision was appealed by the fund to the High Court of Arbitration, but the court accepted the party to the board.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, under which the fund began to pay rent again, as told by the head of the city, Eugenius Roysman.
The rent was set at 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous district administration has donated this building to us, recognizing our drug service, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration had decided differently,” he said.
Tatiana Drogojev, Yekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On July 24, a member of the Gordum of Yekaterinburg, Alexander Kosintsev, invited the mayor of the city, the Speaker of the Gordum, Eugenius Roysman, to resign.
The criminal case involved a person who had been arrested on suspicion of the murder of a pensioner member of Oleg Keenev, a member of the mayor ' s parish.
How Eugenia Roysman was found in a criminal case
On 1 July, it was reported that a criminal case had been brought for the “faith” (art. 128.1 of the Criminal Code) on the blog of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugenius Roysman.
This was reported to the DG of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, where Anna Filatov, the Director of the Legal Centre for the Defence, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Roysman accused her of having blogged her of being involved in the crimes her ex-husband allegedly committed.
The Mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will turn into a wallet
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is due to present its new designs, the press is running new leaks about what can be expected of the presentation.
Referring to United States media sources, the sixth generation of the iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project of Apple and the payment systems of Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the Specialized Internet Resource Re/code, Apple can, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, which will make the new iPhone 6 smartphone a mobile wallet function.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this matter.
This function allows payment to be made on the account of the store by means of a smartphone.
The user will identify the payment on the user's fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will for the first time incorporate the NFC (near field community) technology, which allows for a non-contact payment by means of a smartphone and an appropriate reader on the cashier's account.
The NFC technology itself will be made available by a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced in 2004 as part of the Sony, Nokia, Philips Semicoductors and over a hundred other companies that had joined the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote the technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with the function of NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to tie bank cards to their Google account and to pay with a smartphone on Android.
American experts stress, however, that, despite the huge investment of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, US Ritters are still cautious about innovation and are not willing to spend money on the equipment of their shops with such systems.
Therefore, the observers now hope that Apple’s entry to the market will make the Ritellers speed up and make this technology more widely available in their outlets.
MFA of France: Paris's position on the delivery to Russia of “Mistrailles” has not changed
The official representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Roman Nadal, expressed Paris's unchanging position regarding the delivery to Russia of type Mistral helicopters.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Holland) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August: "Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is a European decision, not a French decision," quotes Mr. Nadal "RIA News."
So the representative of the French foreign policy office answered the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in the position of Paris to implement the contract.
Read more about the transport of helicopters to Russia in the magazine "The Fire" "Mistral" is almost ours."
National Security Council of Ukraine: seven soldiers lost their lives in the area of force in the past 24 hours
The representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Andrey Lysenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the area of combat in the east of the country over the past 24 hours, and 25 others had been injured.
The situation under Iloway is extremely complex.
No details will be made available until the withdrawal operation is completed.
At the end of the operation, the loss and cause of the situation will be disclosed.
Those responsible for this situation will be held responsible,” Mr. Lysenko added, refusing to discuss the situation in more detail under Ilowaysk, where a number of Ukrainian battalions are encircled.
According to the representative of the SNBO, “every effort is being made to return the soldiers in captivity”, reports ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had withdrawn from Lugansk Airport in the direction of the locality of Georgievka.
For more information on the situation in the east of Ukraine, read "Oz" by Arsen Awakov: the first Ukrainian military has left the area under Ilowaysky.
Norwegian Cruise is close to a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises.
The Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stage of negotiations to buy a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for about $3 billion, according to people who know the situation.
The deal would provide the Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to cruise ships of the “Lux” class, and secured clients of the Prestige Cruises, as it competes with the larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, and sources told on Sunday, warning that negotiations might still fail.
The owner of the Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of the shares of the Norwegian Cruise.
Sources have asked to remain unnamed, as the talks are not open.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, manages 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America, and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 per cent over 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands of Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa, and South America.
She announced a $1.2 billion return in 2013, 6 per cent higher than a year earlier.
The 29-billion-dollar cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the growth of the middle class in emerging economies, such as China and India.
The competitors try to position themselves as cruise operators, preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered to the U.S. regulatory authorities for the first public holding of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it is now, in 2000 by merging with a cruise operator belonging to the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment, and a casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in the Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
The Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting held a 28% stake, Apollo held a 20% stake, and the private investment company PPG Capital LP held a 8% stake in the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of the cruise passenger flow in North America, according to the records of the first public posting of Prestige Cruises.
Crimea Radio Company can receive 250 million roubles of subsidies
In Mincoms Russia, it is proposed that 250 million roubles be allocated to the State-run radio and radio company Crimea in 2014.
As can be seen from the draft Mincom-Community Regulation, which is available on a single regulatory disclosure portal, the subsidies are to be spent “to cover the costs of creating the conditions for extensive information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also be used to buy equipment, repair roofs, and power systems in a tele-radio company that was founded in 1959, and is reported by RIA News.
Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists are disrupting the Chinese representative's speech the day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday has set a procedure whereby only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the election of the Hong Kong Chief in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of a majority of the members of the nominating committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision made it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to go to the ballot paper and made the activists of the democratic movement promise to stop Hong Kong's financial center again with the Occupy Central protest.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication by Beijing of a document describing China’s control over Hong Kong in June, the activists of the democratic movement held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the business center of the city and held a sit-in strike.
The briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China People ' s Congress, Djang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Bureau of the State Council of Feng Wei, were also scheduled to address a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students said that they would meet at the Hong Kong Head of Government in the afternoon.
Britain had not mentioned democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to add 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to add 400 hectares of land to the West Bank of the Jordan, which belongs to the Palestinian Authority.
According to BBC, the decision to join South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to retaliate for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence announced the takeover of the territory on Sunday and ordered the military to set up an administrative office on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saïb Arikat, the world must hold Israel accountable for “the continued settlement activity in the West Bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin asks Kyiv to start negotiations on “Statehood” in eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports of his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “Statehood” of the segregated region.
His Spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean to suggest that East Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be re-examined in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call to the Kyiv government to start talks with the pro-Russian rebels as equal to the obvious strategy that it has followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossia de facto independence in order to get closer to Russia, not to the West.
In an interview with State First Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Lugan oblasts, which had been seized in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists recently named the seized territories Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace talks would take place in the near future when Ukrainian politicians began campaigning for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces attacked peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, the “plenary of illusions” reported by ITAR-TASS.
“We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of south-east Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said that Putin’s words about statehood had been in the context of a broader autonomy that had been discussed with leaders in Kiev for months in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The intervention of the Spokesman of the Kremlin to correct the “unfaithful interpretation” of Putin's words underlined the decision of the Russian leadership to act against the separatist uprising in the east in a way other than the open capture of Crimea, where most of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much harder battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts of eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were not Russians, and interviews before the conflict had shown wide support for the desire to stay inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats had discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact by handing over to the Kremlin de facto control of the territory that would link Russia's main territory to Crimea.
On the Black Sea, which was joined five months ago, there is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and lithium factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko, in his inaugural speech on 7 June, proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, weigh the amendments to the Constitution, allowing the segregated regions to have greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy appears to be very different from that of the Kremlin and separatist rebels, who are accused of arming and inciting Moscow.
Putin’s last call to Kyiv to negotiate with separatist leaders, as equals, followed the new rebel attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a former peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an attack that Ukrainian security officials say is afraid of being the start of a campaign to take over the strategic shores to Crimea itself.
This has led to extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, between the Novoazovsky and the narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Porokenko called on the European Union Leaders' Meeting in Brussels on Saturday to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We're getting closer to the point of non-return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any action; the leaders called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia to be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaysk after two columns of Russian armoured equipment and 1,000 military personnel had entered the Donetsk region last week to support the inconvenient separatists, Colonel Andri Lisenko, the press secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, informed reporters in Kyiv on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reported to be being held in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion was exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, telling Lisenko on Sunday.
The scandal with the naked picture captures the Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust with the hackers who might have stolen naked photos of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is indignant after a series of frank photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence went online as a result of a massive hacking scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 candid photos of the star "Food Games" Lawrence and superstars, including the models of Kate Upton and Kara Delevin, the singer Rihanna, Ariane Grande and Lea Michele, and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actor Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Stratovsky, and who lives in Melbourne, Greco is also believed to have been stolen as a result of the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, said Confidential, "This is disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's awful that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York City, is said to have told the news website that the hacker's attack was "conscious" and that the people it was targeting are "invaded."
The hacker is expected to have 30 photos of Palmer and his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two images of her lying by the pool with her breasts naked.
Palmer's work in the movie includes Love and Honor, along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the movie "Chuck" Stratovsky and the actress from "Prohibited Reception" Browning didn't comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ, "This is an obscene invasion of privacy."
The actor, Seth Rogen, expressed his resentment against the hacker by tweeting: "Puting photos stolen from a mobile phone is not really any different from selling stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, you can't stand to publish stolen photos.
A potential way of stealing pictures of naked celebrities has been discovered.
The massive hacking of star accounts may have been made out of a flaw in the "Find My Phone" application.
A potential scenario described The Next Web resource.
A Python script was published on the Github resource, which was able to pick up the passwords for the Window My Phone service of Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
The same string of logs and Apple ID passwords is used to access the Apple iCloud Cloud cloud, from which images of celebrities have been stolen.
The script allowed you to over-recognize the password from the Find My Phone.
In this method, all sorts of character combinations are sequentially introduced, starting with the most common passwords.
The script author claimed that there was an unlimited number of passwords to be entered in the Find My Phone service.
If the security system is properly organized, after a number of failed attempts to enter the incorrect account password, the account must be blocked and the user must be informed of an attempt to break.
Due to vulnerability, users have not received any reports of an attempt to find a password for their account.
The hackers recognized the Apple ID password and used it to access the iCloud.
According to Hackapp's Twitter user, vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and a script program was written for the selection of passwords.
Vulnerability is now closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hackapp user, and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is common in many services, but noted that there is no evidence that this is the kind of vulnerability that was used to access the "stars" account.
It's not me, plz RT
On the Prime Minister's Twitter, there's another extraneous record.
Although there is no solid evidence that theft of the photos was used by a vulnerability in Find My Phone, there was a wave of harmful actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated to the media that the safety of the cloud had not been compromised, but had not investigated how users had lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, was also hacked.
If the intruders had access to the iCloud described above, there might be a password for the head of government account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource failed to get Apple's Vulnerability Comment at Find My Phone.
Poetin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-gauge
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to a well-known Ukrainian athlete, Anne Buryak.
The decree is published on the Internet Portal of Legal Information.
Earlier this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and applied to the Federation of Modern Five Wars for the opportunity to speak for the Russian Federation.
In 2013, she won two phases of the World Cup, won a silver medal for the European Cup in her personal title, and became a world champion in a mixed relay, which is one of the new types of program in this sport.
It also holds a leading position in the current season.
Under the rules, she will need special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine to speak at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Poetin decided to issue a Russian chess card to Catherine Lagno, a native of Lviv, who is a double European champion (2005, 2008), a world of blitz (2010), and a fast chess (2014).
As part of the Ukrainian women's team, the athlete won the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the World Cup in Astana (2013), and the European Cup in Warsaw (2013).
SCR closed the investigation into the Tu-204 Vnukova disaster
The Russian Examining Committee (RCC) dropped the criminal case for the crash of the Tu-204 Airlines Red Wings.
This is reported by the press service of the Department.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the captain of the aircraft and the aircraft engineer.
The forensics showed that the crash was caused by the increased speed of landing, the failure of the crew to implement standard landing procedures, and the inadvertent release of engines to higher direct traction speeds.
The Tu-204 flight of Red Wings to Prague-Moscow crashed on December 29, 2012, landing at Vnukova Airport in Moscow.
The airship rolled over the runway and set fire.
At the scene of the incident, the captain of the aircraft, the second pilot and the flight engineer were killed.
Two flight attendants were taken to the health-care facilities, where they later died of injuries.
Three more flight attendants who had been hospitalized with severe bodily harm received long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the car was seriously injured during the crash on the Kiev Highway.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
In the wake of the disaster, the Public Prosecutor's Office conducted a follow-up check on Red Wings, during which numerous violations were detected.
In February 2013, the airline's license was suspended.
The company resumed work in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelianenko started training at the SIZO
A well-known Russian mixed-style fighter, Alexander Emelianenko, aged 33, who is in the SIZO on charges of sexual assault on a maid, has fully recovered from the trauma and started training.
The Chempiot reports it.
In May this year, the Russian Examining Committee charged Alexander Emelianenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted and was arrested in Tambowa on 9 May following a road accident that resulted in a broken hip.
The Jemelianenko Jr. was arrested until 31 August, and a sentence was handed down on 1 September.
However, the court was rescheduled, and the investigation insisted on the extension of the period of detention until 30 September.
If proved guilty, the athlete would be sentenced to up to six years ' imprisonment.
What's the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelianenko's career.
His last match last year, Yemelianenko, lost a technical knockout to his compatriot, Dmitri Szkonski.
Alexander is the younger brother of the more famous fighter Fedor Emelianenko.
The latter is a four-time world champion in mixed martial arts, a four-time world champion, and a seven-time Russian champion in combat samba.
Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional human emotion.
An angry expression is biologically universal for mankind, and each organ and group of muscles involved in it is not random, but an additional means of expression of power and threat, and scientists in Australia and the United States have learned.
They spoke about their discoveries in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and can be found in a press release by the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - the swept and lowered eyebrows, stretched out into a thin line of lips, the spiked nostrils - are the same in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth children who have never seen it, notes the lead author of the study, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has emerged to deal effectively with disputes during the conflict.
The more physical harm one person can do to another, the more he has the power to dictate his condition, and he is bringing it to the person in question by means of anger.
Researchers have also found another hypothesis: physical ones are more likely to become angry and to resort to handicrafts, have the right to impose conditions that are of no use to others, and have preferred forceful methods of conflict resolution to be peaceful.
In view of the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of tendering,” scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create an angry expression of the face should represent an angry individual that is more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer - and thus force him to accept its terms as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers modelled on the computer the persons who had or did not have each of the seven elements of the angry person and showed them to the informers.
Although the lower eyebrows or the forward chin alone did not make the face angry, the more powerful man with such traits was recognized by the researchers as unanimously.
Human anger, like that of animals, is a threat: an exaggeration of self - control, which forces us to accept and submit.
A person blows up his nostrils and his lips for the same purpose as a frog that blows up, or a baboon that displays his fangs.
“Anger” is “started” by a person's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately adopts a form that best demonstrates the consequences of this refusal to the contrary.
But the most amazing thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tuby.
Minicom offered 250 million roubles to Crimea's radio company
The minicoms proposed to allocate 250 million roubles from the federal budget to the autonomous non-profit organization Krim Teleradio Company in 2014.
This is stated in a draft government decree prepared by the department that was consulted by Lenta.ru.
According to the Explanatory Note to the project, the federal budget subsidies will be “to cover the costs of creating the conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is intended to convert the hardware and studio unit, the video walls, the central hardware and the video server.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fiber-optic line (VALS) and the maintenance of the energy system.
Subsidies will be made available within the federal budget for the Minicom.
The State Broadcasting Company Crimea was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, over 75 per cent of the peninsula is covered by a television signal.
In 2011, Krim's Teleradio Company was granted a digital broadcasting license.
