Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will “joint with the muppets”
Some CAs are horrified by the recommendation to change the name of their office to “member of Parliament Wales” (MWP).
This recommendation was made because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Parliament of Wales".
WHEN all the political spectrum is concerned, it can make fun of you.
One of the laborers said that his group was worried about the Twp and the Pwp.
For readers outside Wales, "twp" means "unconceived", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
CA from the Welsh Party said that his group was generally "not content" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh Conservatives said that his group was “inconclusive” about changing the name, but noted that MWP could quickly become a “mappet.”
In this context, the word "w" is the same as the word "u" in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is in the process of developing a law to change names, observed: “The rest of the decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Self-Settlement Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of the public debate on the proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly to the Welssa Parliament received wide support.
In terms of how to call the CA, the commission proposes to call them "the members of the Wels Parliament," or WMP, but the MWP option has received the most public support.
Of course, the CHA offers alternatives, but trying to reach agreement can cause problems to head Elien Jones, who should submit a bill for change for a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including rules for the exclusion of the FA and the structure of the committee system.
WHEN the law is discussed, the final vote will be held on their new name.
The Macedonians go to a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the polls announce whether to change the name of the country to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
Voting was organized to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim in the territory of Greece, and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
President George Ivan of Macedonia, who opposes the holding of a referendum on the change of name, said that he would ignore the results of the vote.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that the change of name is just the price that should be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
Call St. Maarten, 'cause the Harlem Church is going through a difficult time.
“The old people I've been talking to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither of them."
He believes that the loss of bars can be understood:
“In modern times, people are socializing in a different way.
Bars are no longer the local hotel they visit regularly.
As far as churches are concerned, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expect, and “they will end up where they started.”
Churches, he added, can replace condominium houses, and there will be people living there who will not help the shrines that are in the vicinity.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will speed up the day that all of these churches will close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their members.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropole Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Maarten was built ten years later.
The root white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community, which had held rites in the vicinity, was entitled to the property of the building.
Saint-Martin moved to the black community under the leadership of reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the splintered merchants on 125th Street, the main trading street of Harlem, who refused to take blacks to work and raise them in the service.
In 1939 the fire severely damaged the building, but the parishioners of Father Johnson wanted to reinstate it and set up a carillon.
The reverend David Johnson, son and successor to Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the Carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who was playing the Carillon in July called it a different term: “cultural treasure” and “the permanent historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that this is the world's first carillon to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to a bigger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivester, he was not replaced in St. Martin.
What's happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and subsidiaries, some of whom have been involved by church leaders, others by the bishop diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, which is made up of worldly leaders, wrote in July to the diocese, which is concerned that the diocese “will try to pass on the expenses” with the council not taking part in the recruitment of the architects and subsidiaries sent by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained that the diocese was not transparent.
Shark was traumatized by a 13-year-old boy who ran behind lobsters in California.
According to the officials, on Saturday, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, and the boy was running behind the lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place at almost 7:00 a.m. at Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that Saturday morning he had been running around half an hour with his friends when he heard the boy screaming for help, and along with the group rushed to get him out of the water.
At first Hummel thought it was just the thrill of catching a lobster, but then he realized the boy was yelling, "I've been bit!
I've been tasted."
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his collarbone was completely broken.
"I was yelling at everyone to come out of the water, "in the water of a shark!", Hummel added.
The boy was taken to the Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
The rescue captain, Larry Giles, told the media that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in the area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the upper body.
For research and security purposes, the authorities closed off access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to go to the British make-up market
Sainsbury's going to compete with Bots, Superdrug, and Debenhams by means of cosmetics-like islands that are in the top.
As part of the increased entry to the British cosmetics market at a cost of 2,8 billion pounds sterling (although it continues to grow at a time when the volume of sales of clothing and household goods is declining) the increased island with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores all over the country, and the following year, if the idea is successful, the island will appear in other stores.
Invest in cosmetics is linked to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the field that was used on TV, microwave ovens, and household goods.
The Sunsbury's stated that they double the assortment of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 brands for the first time, such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Mybelline, and Burt's Bees's assortment will have more space: branded areas like those that are in stores like Bots.
Supermarkets also update the Boutique assortment: now most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which are increasingly required by young buyers.
In addition, the decorated parfum salesman Fragrace Shop protestes his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second one opens in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Web-shoping and moving to the purchase of small amounts of food every day in small shops makes supermarkets make extra effort to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of the Sunsbury's, stated that their stores would become more like a department store, as the supermarket network was trying to resist Aldi and Lidl Discounters with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's opening up Argos in hundreds of their shops, also opening up a number of Habitats.Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claimed that it had increased sales of food products, and made both networks more profitable.
The last attempt by the supermarket to update the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments failed.
Sainsbury's had been tested with Bots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute about how to split the income from the supermarkets.
The new strategy came after the Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) to Célesio, the owner of the Loyds Pharmaceutical Network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
They agreed that the Lloyds would help by adding an extended suite of leather-care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vicky, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the business director of the Sunsbury, said: "We have changed the looks of our cosmetics islands to make the atmosphere more pleasing to the customers.
We also invested in specially trained counselors who would be able to give advice.
The brands that we present are called upon to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and comforting locations means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is the competition of the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "discolored" because Holly Willoughby came out of a deal worth 11 million pounds sterling.
The star "Druck Foot" Peter Jones is "splintered" because Holly Willoughby's TV spree out of a deal with his brand of goods for life (the contract is 11 million pounds sterling) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of home clothes and Truly's axes.
The couple's business was linked to the Goop Gwyneth Peltrow brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced her entry to Instagram.
Holly Willowby led Peter Jones's star "Draak Fist" to the story when at the last moment she came out of their lucrative business of goods for life to focus on the new win-win contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is “splintered” when a gold girl on TV confessed at a busy Tuesday meeting at the Johns Business Empire's headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal of 1.5 million pounds of sterling means that she no longer has enough time to dedicate it to their common brand of home clothes and Truly's axes.
This business was linked to the Goop Gwyneth Peltrow brand, and it had to double the value of Willoughby, which is estimated to be 11 million pounds of sterling.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby told Instagram that she was coming from Truly, Jones left the United Kingdom for one of her rest houses.
The source said: "Truly was no doubt the main priority of Holly.
He was to be her long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to quit the business was astonished by all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
At Marlowe's headquarters, it's a full set of things ready for sale.
The experts believe that the entry of the head of This Morning, one of the highest-paid stars in the United Kingdom, may have cost companies millions of dollars because of the huge investment in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes) and to create further delays with the start-up.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The three children Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willowby and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
The couple held the festivals together, and Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of the Baldwin industry.
Willowby will become the M&S brand agent and replace Anthony McPartlin as the lead I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
The source close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism that the news media will get for commenting on what someone would consider “non-presidential,” as well as the very positive attitude toward North Korea’s leader.
"Why did President Trump do such a big thing? "
said Trump, imitating the voice of the host. —
I didn't go to any action."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks went into a dead end.
More than three months after the June alone in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a “suitable response” from the United States to its first disarmament steps.
Instead, he remarked, the US is continuing the sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump was far more optimist in giving a speech at his meeting.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have such a beautiful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results: the completion of missile tests, the release of the hostages, and the return of the rest of the American military.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
“It's so easy to be a president, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this stacked stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of it.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake in Lomboca, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lomboca suffered, the national disaster was not declared, and this is a transformation for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it's a bit difficult,” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Pale, it is not yet known if foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster management agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palau to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
In view of the constant occurrence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains horribly unprepared for the anger of nature.
In the province of Aceh, the tsunami havens have been built, but they are not characteristic of the other coasts.
The apparent absence of alarms about the tsunamis in Pale, even though the warning was active, was likely to have contributed to death.
Moving between the countless Indonesian islands is more than just in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logic even more complex.
The medical ship that was in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Pale, but it will be possible to reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made the infrastructure of Indonesia the basis of his campaign and increased the cost of roads and railroads.
But the funding gap has created problems for the administration of Mr. Joko, who is planning to change next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by the persistence of inter-confessional rivalries in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands of people hung out of their homes as a result of the resistance of Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool scores the ball from the field and compares the account to Chelsea
Daniel Starridge rescued the Liverpool from the defeat of the Chelsea in Première's with his bare head for the 89th minute Saturday at the London Stadium Stadium "Stemford Bridge".
Starridge got a pass from Jerdan Shachiri when he was about 27 meters from the Chelsea gate. At that point, his team was playing with an account of 1-0.
He rolled the ball on his left leg and loaded it in the direction of the long-distance pants.
The ball flew high above the penalty in the direction of the upper right corner of the gate.
He flew over the jumping Capa Arrisabalago and fell into the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take that position so as not to waste time; players like Shachiri are always going to attack as much as possible, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible,” said Starridge LiverpoolC.com.
I saw Kante coming, and I made one touch, I didn't think about it too much, and I just took the ball.
"Chelsey" led with a score of 1-0 after the first time that the Belgian star, Eden Azar, scored a goal for 25 minutes.
The blue attacker passed back to Mateo Kovacic, rolled around the middle of the field, and ran fast half the Liverpool.
Kovacich quickly played the wall in the middle of the field.
Then he made a fine penetrating pass, which led Azar to a fine.
Azar ran out of control and struck his left foot in the grid of the long-distance pants, and the ball passed over the gateway of the Liverpool, Aliceson Becker.
Liverpool is playing against "Napole" in the group stage of the League of Champions at 3:00 a.m. in the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of tsunami-related deaths in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, reported by the Indonesian disaster management agency on Sunday morning.
A lot of people left in the trap of the wreckage of buildings that had been destroyed during the Friday earthquake with a force of 7.5 points, which caused a wave of six meters high, reported to the press secretary of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Pale, home to more than 380,000 people, has been swept over by ruins of the damaged buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man for suspected murder after a woman was slaughtered to death.
The murder investigation started after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Mercisside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with a stab wound in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man is suspected of being murdered.
The police called for a response from people who had seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially the taxi driver, who might have taken a video recorder, to contact us, because the information on these videos can be very important to our investigation.
A member of the police confirmed that the woman whose body had been found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
Today, in the afternoon, friends who believe that they know a woman have come to the scene of the crime to ask where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said that they are in the process of informing the victim’s closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson-Muse, just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police said no one was allowed to go in and out of the house.
When he learned what had happened, he lost the gift of speech.
The inhabitants are now told that it will be an hour before they are allowed to return home.
Some have heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, a woman appeared in tears.
She says, "It's so terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were standing behind the fence, and another van was standing in front of the fence.
A number of policemen were standing behind the fence and following the apartment home.
All who have information are asked to write a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101, or anonymously call the Krimestoppers line to number 0800 555 111, and name the code 247 and the date of September 30.
The Cromwell article near the Parliament is becoming a new monument that suffers from the “census of history”
The removal of the statue would have been a well-deserved payment for the destruction in the Taliban style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatic puritan followers.
But Cromwell's cohort called Mr. Creek's offer a “dreamy” and an“tempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, head of Cromwell's Division, said: "Bearing in mind the current debate about the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell at the Westminster Palace would become a target.
Iconisting during the English civil wars was not carried out by Cromwell himself or under his orders.
Cromwell is likely to be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, in the last century.
The grand statue of Cromwell's sculptor William Hamo Thorneicroft is a 19th-century experience and part of the history of the art that many think is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many who, probably more in the late 19th century than now, views Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course, in his case, a monarchy.
Whether that idea is entirely accurate is the subject of historical debates that continue.
Undoubtedly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the future of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the known items that represents one side of the conflict.
His accomplishments as a Lord Prospector should also be celebrated and respected.
The killer pig killed a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local MFIs, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the name of Yuan was found dead in blood, with a broken artery near a pig shop in Liupanchuy, Guizhou, reported to South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sinin, Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005, the pig is about to vaccinate the pigs in the pigyard.
It is reported that on Wednesday he left with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw that the pork’s door was open.
The brother pointed out that there was a big boar in the pig shop with blood on his mouth.
The forensic experts confirmed that the 249-pound boar had demolished the farmer to death.
“The legs of my cousin were in blood and deformed,” the cousin claimed to have suffered with the name Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera records show that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The creature that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police gathered evidence at the scene, the pig was shut down to prevent it from attacking people.
It is reported that the seven I am Yuan and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Though rare, cases of swine attack on people have been recorded before.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and caused critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295 - kg - weighted pig held a Welsh farmer clinging to a tractor until the farmer’s wife terrorized the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer said CBC News said that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a triger.
"They're just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to treat them with due respect,' he said.
Storm Rose’s Overflows Will Bring Extensive Rains to the Southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is collapsing over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
But in the nearest days, Rose will bring the rains with the flooding to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rose had winds at a rate of 137 km per hour (this is a hurricane of category 1), 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
He's expecting Rose to go north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific is beginning to form a hull that is moving east to the west coast of the United States, and when Rose arrives on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will start to push a strong tropic moisture to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 25,4 centimeters of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, on the nearest day, the tropical dampness that interacts with the nearby hull will create strong rains in the southwest.
In this area, between 2,54 and 10,2 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flooding, garbage streams, and the possibility of displacement in the desert.
Severe tropic dampening will result in an increase in the number of drops to 5 to 7.6 cm per hour, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5–10,2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in a significant area of Arizona.
Floods are possible under severe conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We urge you not to go to the desert on foot, for there may be tropical rains.
Severe rain can make canyons stormy rivers, and storms can bring winds and dust storms.
The coming of the water will cause intense rains in some parts of the north coast of California.
The number of drops can be over 1.27 cm, which can cause low waste streams and slippery roads.
It's gonna be the first storm in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and in the morning on Monday, and in the evening on Monday and Tuesday the rain will become more extensive.
It's going to rain a lot over the For Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature swings throughout the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
At times, this can lead to a sharp change in temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, you can see a wonderful example of a sharp temperature change in central US.
This is a nearly 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Desmonds, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer warmth will try to return and spread.
It is expected that in a significant area in the center and east of the United States it will be warm by October, and the temperature from the south to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above the mean temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability that the average temperature in the eastern part of the United States will exceed in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Cavanaugh case
On Thursday, over 20 million people in six TV networks watched the thrilling testimony of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Cavanaugh, and Christine Blazey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s.
The political opposition continued, and the channels interrupted the scheduled programs to report the last Friday's news: a deal prepared by Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake, that the FBI had conducted a one-week investigation into the charge.
Ford told the Court Committee of the Senate that she was 100% sure that Cavanaugh was getting her drunk and trying to take off her clothes at the high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were watching this on Friday, as reported by the Nielsen research company.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
It was not possible to get the numbers on other networks that also showed the listeners, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people who watch TV in the office.
By comparison, this audience is similar in size to an audience that watches a play-off or Oscar's award.
Fox News Channel, whose fans strongly supported Cavanaugh's assignment, was the leader of all the channels during the day-long listeners, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, at Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
The interview remained high after the hearing.
Blake became the center of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he was going to vote for Cavanaugh, and then on Friday morning, CNN's and CBS's cameras caught the protesters yelling at Flake when he tried to take the elevator to the Court's Committee.
He was standing with his eyes down for a few minutes, and he was barked in direct air on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
It was said to him, "You have power, but a host of women are powerless."
Flake reported that his office had published the application and, before the lift closed, he added that he would say more at the committee's hearing.
All cable and wide-area channels broadcast live hours later, when the Courts Committee was to vote to advance Cavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate in full.
Flake said he'd only do it if he knew the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate next week, which requires a democratic minority.
Fleke was partly persuaded to talk to his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Coons.
After talking to Kuns, and then with a few more senators, Blake made a decision.
Flek's choice had an impact, as it was evident that the Republicans would have no votes to appoint Cavanaugh's candidacy without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Teresa May blames critics for "policy games" around Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her exit plans from the European Union of playing "policy" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, the British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain.
In another interview that took place next to Teresa's interview on the front page of the newspaper, the former minister of foreign affairs of her government, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Checkers Plan for Brexit, saying that it was “absolutely absurd” to offer Britain and the EU to draw one another's toll.

The police arrested a suspected shooter who led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana.
20-year-old Daiton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison for second-level murder, reported to the Baton-Rose Police Department.
The authorities published video arguments between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his eyeballs during the fight.
According to an affidavited CBS TV station WAFB, the police removed the eyeballs from the scene of the crime and noted that they had found Simpson's DNA on them.
After interviewing Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed that he had shot Wade.
According to counsel, he was given a bail of $350,000.
The Coroner's Office of the East Baton-Rage published a previous report on Friday, which states that the cause of death is a fire wound to the head and neck.
The Department is grateful to the Special Unit for the Search for the Police of the State of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Lab, the University of the South Police Force and the local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The Sports Director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Alllev, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for “the diligence and the desire for justice. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
Forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, the average result was 5.6 points and 2.6 scores.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the University of Louisiana, Will Wade, said that the team was "desolated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“It's something that's bothering you all the time,” Wade said.
Vulcan throws ashes out on Mexico City
Popocatepetl’s ash has reached the south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Warning Center, on Saturday, urged the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater had begun to be active and 183 gas and ash releases had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center traced a lot of noises and blows.
Photos on social media show thin ash layers on the frontal cliff of motor vehicles in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Hogimilko.
Geophysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, following an earthquake of 7.1 points in central Mexico in September 2017.
The Volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police met with the Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters who were pro-independence met with the Special Police Unit, and thousands of people joined protesters to celebrate the first anniversary of Katalonia's vote on the division.
A pro-separatist group with masks that had been held back by the special purpose was putting them in eggs and powder paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually full of tourists.
There were spores later that day, and the police used the sticks to contain the aggression.
A few hours later, the groups of independenceists who had been saying, "Let's not forget, let's not forget! " , ran into the country's keepers, shouting, "Let's live Spain! "
According to a local press report, fourteen people were given help in the light of the injuries sustained during the protests.
One year after the referendum, October 1, which was declared illegal by Madrid but marked by Catalan separatists, the tension in the region, which is a region that wants to be independent, remains high.
The polls generally voted for independence, but the turnout was low, since most of the opponents boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people had been injured in brutal collisions last year as a result of the police's efforts to stop voting in polling stations all over the region.
The independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations from being supported by the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it had to take a different route.
The 68-year-old Narcisse Termes, an electrician who was involved in a separatist protest with his wife, claimed that he no longer had the hope that Catalan might gain independence.
"We've been through one of our best moments this past year.
I watched my parents cry out for joy, who can vote, but now we're in a deaf corner," he said.
Despite the vital but very complex victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties, which are pro-independence, have not been able to maintain the momentum of this year, as many of their most prominent leaders are in voluntary banishment or imprisonment, awaiting trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and the further declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who withdrew a protest against police support on the phone, claimed that the conflict was aroused by politicians on both sides.
“The stress is getting worse,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the insulator since the end of last year, announced that next year he would be running for the European Parliament.
“The candidacy of European elections is the best way to condemn the regress of democratic values and reprisals that we are witnessing from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men were arrested after the car entered the house
Three men at the age of 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after the car had entered a house in Londonderre on several occasions.
The incident took place in Ballingaard-Crescent at 7:30 p.m. in British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings observed that the gate and the house had been damaged.
It is possible that at some point the car was shot from a crossbow.
Menga hit Livingston to win the Rangers with a score of 1-0
The first Hall of Dolly Menga in Livingston became the winner
A high-level Livingstone stunned the Rangers and brought Stephen Gerrard the second of 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The impact of Dolly Menga was decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to one level in a second from the Cybernian.
Gerrard's team won no victory at the première's this season and next Sunday will play with the Harts leaders, from whom it is eight points away.
Before that, the Rangers will accept the "Rage of Wenen" at the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston continues to make his invincible move to six games in the Division, and Chief coach Holt has not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the odds that give unscrupulous visitors.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they killed them, because their directness creates all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but struck along the gate, and then Alan Litgow punched over the gate after he had slammed and accepted the Craig Hulkett strike along the gate, which he had made his head.
The hosts were satisfied that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew that they could cause problems to the guests of the standard position.
So the final goal was struck.
The Rangers missed the free shot, and Livingston opened up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Menga, who took the ball and shot it off the center of the ticket.
To this point, Rangers was dominated by the use of the ball, but the protection of the landlords was inexperienced, and the gatekeeper, Liam Kelley, was mostly not disturbed.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike in the direction of Kelley.
Scott Pittman's punch hit Allan McGregor with his foot on the Rangers, and Litgoe hit the gate in another standard Livingstone combination.
The naves continued to fly into the Livingston penalty and were permanently neutralized, and the two applications for a penalty — after the attack on Glenn Middleton, who went out to replace him, and behind the game with his hand — were rejected.
Livingston Phenomenon: Analysing
Alasdair Lamont of "BBC Scotland" at the Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
The Phenomenal Game and the Livingston result.
All of them played well, and they continued to outpace the expectations of this source trajectory.
Their style of play and composition did not change very much after returning to the highest level, but you have to give Holt the right thing to do for how he mobilised the team after he got here.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulket played a huge, very well-organized defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Warral watchful.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerrard's guidance, but they don't get much of that.
They didn't have enough of the last ball -- just one time they broke the defense of the landlords -- and it was kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers, which was in the middle of the table.
Erogon was received in Cologne in ambivalent way
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and the blue sky were visible.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's conflicting visit to Germany, aimed at re-establishing relations among NATO's allies.
There have been some controversy among them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but a lot of the president's supporters still showed up nearby to see it.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogon, among them many Kurds, have also made themselves hear, and they condemn the policy of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The bipartisan protest shows ambiguities that some German Turks have called a hero and others a dictator.
Road crash in Depford: The cyclist was killed in a car accident
The rider was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The crash took place at the Bestwood Street Crossroads and Evelyn Street on a live road in the Deptford area in the southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m. in the British Standard Time.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
This crash took place a few months after another cyclist had died after a driver had escaped from the scene of an adventure on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the Saturday crash.
The London Police said that they were working on setting up a man’s identity to inform his next of kin.
Travel bans and bus routes have been changed, and motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long-Lartin prison: six prisoners are traumatized in an upheaval
Six of the prison staff were injured as a result of the disturbances in the men's prison of strict security, reported to the prison administration.
Her Majesty Long-Lartin's prison in Woostershire started at about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, British standard time, and it's still going on.
To stop the upheaval, the eight incarcerated and colonized in the same wing, was called up by the special unit "Tornado."
The officers were given medical care in connection with the light facial injuries they had received at the scene.
A member of the prison service commented: “In order to resolve the incident that is taking place in the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, specially trained prison staff have been involved.
Six of the coworkers got medical treatment for the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and the terms of their stay behind the bars can be doubled.
In the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, there are over 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden of the prison had been sent to a state-of-the-art treatment after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, the Special Police Department was called to the prison to stop the serious disturbances in which the prisoners had been assaulted with belliards.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm flooding.
Tropic depression rarely hits Arizona, but this can happen at the beginning of the next week, as the rest of Hurricane Rose is heading through the southwest of the desert, putting the risk of storm flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of flooding on Monday and Tuesday, from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and it's gonna rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix observed in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones had maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
and Catrina in 1967 was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the border of Arizona.
According to recent forecasts by the National Hurricane Center, the Mogallon-Rome area in Arizona is estimated to be between 5.08 and 10.16 cm, and at 15.24 cm of drop.
Other areas in the southwest of the desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get between 2.54 and 5.08 cm of rain, with possible sites up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of storming, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region suffers from drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of these spills are likely to be useful, as the south-west is in the process of drying up.
According to the United States Dry Monitoring Centre, a little over 40 percent of the area of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category of drought, reports Weather.com.
First of all, the way of Hurricane Rose has led to cliffs on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rose, still in the middle of a storm on Sunday morning at a maximum wind rate of 137 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at a rate of 19.3 km/h.
The storm is faced with a more cooler water in the Pacific Ocean, and it's depressing.
In this way, it is expected that the storm will cause a storm in Mexico during the day or in the evening of a tropical storm.
The number of rains in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected that the total rainfall from Lower California to Northwest Sunora will range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm,” reportsweather.com.
Next, Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, get the border of Arizona early in the morning as a tropic depression that will go further through Arizona and late in the evening on Tuesday to South Utah.
“The main danger that Rose or her remains are expected to face is the very strong rains in Lower California, Northwest Sonar, and Southwest of the American Desert,” reports the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life - threatening storms and streams of waste in the deserts, as well as to landslides in the mountainous area.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four men arrested, who had plotted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after they found a 16-year-old guy with a knife wound in Somerset.
A wounded teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton about 4:00 p.m. in British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, and reported to the Avon and Somerset Police.
The police are asking to respond to anyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump says that Cavanaugh was “didn't be mad and angry” by the Democratic Party
“The voice of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh had been “didn't be mad and angry” by the Democratic Party during the whole hang-up process.
Cavanaugh gave a witness in front of the Congress on Thursday, unspeakably and emotionally denouncing the accusation of Christin Blazey Ford that he had committed sexual violence against her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness at a hearing about the charges against her.
On Saturday, the president stated that the American people had seen Cavanaugh's brilliance, character, and courage on that day.
“The voice of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for one of the most perfect jurists of our time, a lawyer with perfect experience in the public service,” he said to a crowd of West Virginia followers.
The president made a clear reference to Cavanaugh's stand when he spoke of the importance of the Republican turnout in the mid-street elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
I'm not running, but I'm really running,' he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump claimed that the mission of the Democrats was to “oppose and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Cavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, and CNN has been informed by an assistant of a Republican leader.
Hundreds of people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of casualties is on the rise
At least 384 people died, many were washed into the ocean when the huge waves fell on the beaches as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawes, claiming the country’s authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when a wave of up to six meters (18 feet) hit the shore in the dark, killing a lot of people to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7,5 points.
“When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach, and they didn't immediately start running, and they were victims,” said the BNPB, a representative of the Indonesian disaster management agency in Jakarta, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
“It was not just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on the land,” Nugroho said, adding that, before it hit the shoreline, the tsunami went through the open sea at a rate of 800 km/h (497 miles/year).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed the trees and survived, he added.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
Aerophotos published by the disaster management agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been turned out and demolished, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The blows in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy generated by the massive Friday earthquake was 200 times more than the energy of the atomic bomb that had been dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bay, may have contributed to the force of the tsunami, said the agency.
Nugroho called the loss “broad-scale” and noted that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
Some of the victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had been missing without a word.
Nugroho observed that the damage and damage may be more than 300 kilometers (190 miles) along the coastline to the north of Pale in an area called Donggal, which is close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn't get any information” from Dongali,” Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people, as stated in the Red Cross Declaration, and it is added that its personnel and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
“It is already a tragedy, but it can become much more,” the report states.
On Saturday, the agency received a wide range of criticism for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Pale, even though the officials said that the waves had come at the time of the warning.
On the amortized images that people shared in social media, a man on the top of the building is shouting wild warnings about the approaching of the tsunamis on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the water wall hit the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the reality of the frames immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a serious shutdown of the power that cut off the link around Pale, which made it more difficult to coordinate the rescue.
The army began to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, reporting to the authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic items.
The city airport was opened for help only, and it will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit evacuation centers in Palau on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is more than 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision partners with Donggaly have safely reached the city of Pale, where they hide in tarpaulins set up in the courtyard of their office, but on the way they saw the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseba.
“They told me that they had seen a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams began to act decisively to deal with the consequences of the catastrophe, some complained that foreign relief workers had experienced a great deal of difficulty in allowing them to go to Pale.
Under the Indonesian rules, financing, providing and providing personnel from abroad can only begin if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a disaster at the level of the province,” observed Aulius Arriani, a member of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Good, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted."
The second night had been down on Pala after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, and friends and families of those who had not yet been found still had hoped that the arrival of their loved ones would be a miracle that would paint those grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy got out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers got a woman who had been under stone for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, a trainer of the Indonesian national team with paraplaneracy, trained two disappeared paraplaners to participate in the Asian games earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paramedics, who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As an elder in the field of paraplaneracy, I have my emotional burden,” he said.
He tells us how, a few hours after the news of the ruining of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to the community of paralyzers, he was desperately sending a message to the WatsApp rivals of Pale, who had taken part in the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with only one gray point, not double-blue points.
"I think that means that the message was not delivered," he said.
The thieves took US$26,750 when the ATM was filled to Newport on the Levie
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from Brink, who ran the ATM at the Newport on the Levie, a news report to the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man "walked back to Brink's coworker" and hijacked a sack of money to fill out.
Witnesses spotted a number of suspects who had fled the scene of the crime in the news, but the police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rap changes its name to E
Repper Kanye West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, when he announced a change on Twitter, he wrote, "Previously officially known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West was called "E" for a while, and he used this shortcut as a name for his album, released in June.
The change occurred in advance of his appearance on the "Saturday Night Live", where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
At the show, he replaces a singer named Ariane Grande, who has cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons," and reported it.
This is not just a shortening of the present professional name, and West used to say that the word had a religious meaning for him.
“I believe "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with Big Boy's radio talker. —
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The canyé, which means "one," was shortened to just "Y," is just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is one of a few well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Grandpa, P. Grandpa and Grandpa, this year announced that he had chosen the name Love and Brother Love.
A former colleague of West, J.S.I., also experimented with defiance and big letters.
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised never to use the army against the civilian population, and soon the country will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the bloodthirsty trial of the students.
On Saturday, on the Talatelloloco Square, López Obrador promised to “never use the army to stifle the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people, while the left student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to learners and by opening more free state universities.
He pointed out that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities lead young people to criminal groups.
The US needs to double finance in the field of artificial intelligence.
Since China is generating activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US needs to double the amount it spends on research in this field, and believes that an investment and practicer in the field of AI Kai-Foo Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These comments were made after different parts of the U.S. government made statements about the SI, although the U.S. has no formal strategy in the SI.
In fact, China presented its plan last year: it wants to be number one in the SHI innovation until 2030.
“The double budget for the AI study would be a good start, considering that all the other countries are far behind the US, and we are preparing for the next gap in the AI field,” Lee said.
Double-funding can double the probability that the next big achievement in the field of HI will be made in the U.S., said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "The State of the Sea: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director General of the Foundation for Synovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of the most famous SHI companies in China.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he was working on the SHI system, which beat the best American player in Othello, and later the executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Philly of Google.
Lee observed a previous competition with the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research (DARPA), and asked when the next ones would be to help identify the next prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to win state grants, says Lee.
“It's not China taking academic leaders, it's a corporation,” he remarked.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring a glimpse from universities in recent years to work on the AI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. to increase efforts in the field of AI.
“I think the Green Card should be automatically offered to the SHI candidates,” he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of the Artificial Intelligence of the New Generation in July 2017.
China's National Science Foundation provides funding to people working in academic institutions, just like the National Science Foundation and other US government agencies donate money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee of Artificial Intellect.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As far as the National Science Foundation is concerned, it now invests over $100 million a year in the IA study.
In fact, the U.S. lawmakers, who wanted to set up a Commission for National Security of the Artificial Intelligent, did not take any steps for a few months.
The Macedonians Vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to “the Republic of North Macedonia,” which will allow for the resolution of a multi-year dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia’s possibility of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the North Neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's entry to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments made a deal on the basis of a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the deal claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavonic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the minimal 50 per cent of the voters would be present, which would make it possible for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum report is: “Do you support membership of NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the break-up of Yugoslavia, should pay to join bodies like the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Oliver Georgie in Skopje.
While the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament have said that they will support it to make it decisive.
To change the name, it will take two thirds of the vote in Parliament.
The National Election Commission stated that by 1 p.m. there had been no reports of violations.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters threw their ballots in the trash.
“I've come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” declared the 62-year-old pick of Ghose Tanevski in the capital of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Stroom, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zayev, his wife, Zorika, and his son Dusko gave their vote in a referendum to change the name of the country, which will open the way for the entry of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodymyr Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and placed chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go there with our head up proudly, not through the service door,” said the Kovardarkovs.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zion believes that membership of NATO will bring a lot of needed investment in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that most of our citizens are in favor, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zayev said after the vote.
He pointed out that the “yes” result would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters will take part in the referendum, which is the following statement.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telema, 57 percent of the respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they'd vote for it.
For the referendum to be declared valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the politics of the Western government since it began in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City is running the entire Briton defense and scores a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling went through Briton's defense and led Manchester City to win with a score of 2-0 on Saturday at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The Aguero Hall for the 65th minute of the match looked like a funny, simple one.
The Argentinian attacker was given a pass at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequencing.
He ran between the three Britons and found himself in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went round one defender, and then ran a few more on the edge of the Briton penalty.
Then he made a pass to the left when he saw Sterling.
An English forward made the first touch on the penalty line to hand over the Aguero ball, which, with his right boot, launched it in the right side of the gate, defeating the Greater "Brighton" by Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some leg problems," said the reporter's manager, "City" Pep Guardiola.
We agreed he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We're lucky he scored the goal at this moment."
But the initial advantage of the celestial-blue in this match was that of Sterling.
That goal was 29 minutes ago.
Aguero got the ball deep in Briton's area.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Leroy Sanae.
Leroy made a few touches, and he went on to pass Sterling in the direction of the long-distance pants.
Forward of the Celestial-Blue threw the ball at the gate just before he hurled out.
The City will meet with Hoffhenheim at the group stage of the League of Champions at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Raine-Nekkar Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take the points to Roxie
As the Washington Nashwalls team left the playoffs, there was no real reason to wait for the next start.
But a rival Sherzer hopes to go to the petcher bitterness on Sunday in a match against Colorado Rockies, provided that the Roxie still has difficulty getting to playoffs, and that the Rockies will now have one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
The Rockies have at least a Wild Card for winning the 5-2 account over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to secure the title of the first division.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to get out of the ball, knowing how the viewers are doing here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level that I've seen this year.
Why don't I want to take part in this race?
The Nationals are going to announce who's going to be the starter on Sunday, but it's reported that they're leaning to it that it's going to be Sherzer.
Sherzer, for whom this will be the 34th start, has a pitching session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, usually his weekend.
The Washington right has a score of 18-7 of the 2.53 ERA and 300 strike outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump meetings in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation around his candidate for the Supreme Court of Britta Cavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the presence of Republican supporters in the mid-street elections.
“All we've done will be at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
It's one of the big, big -- I don't run, but I'm really running, so I'm fighting for great candidates wherever I can,' he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, horrendous radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And they're determined to return power, using any means, you see the vileness, the depravity.
They don't care who's suffering from them, who's the one who needs to step over to get power and control, they want power and control, we don't want to give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is “to resist and hinder.”
“And you've been seeing it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “vilest and mean, filthy, and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Court Committee, naming the Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein by name, who provoked the audience to hear loud calls of displeasure.
"Remember her answer?
Did you submit the document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was a really bad language of the body rovers -- the worst language of the body rovers I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is incomprehensible to those who express their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to convict me, it was almost no surprise.
Finally, I am the last of those labor members of Parliament to be told that they are not happy, and that is because we express our opinion.
My Parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated almost the same way because she was determined to oppose anti-Semiticism.
I was convicted for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As for the importance of responsible economic policy, with regard to national security, in Europe, these questions are ironically similar to those on which Jeremiah disagreed with previous leaders.
In a report on the Nottingham East meeting on Friday, it says, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the evenings of the General Committee's Friday meetings in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the laborers were like this.
Sadly, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of “more benevolent, softer” politics has long been forgotten if it has ever been implemented.
It is becoming more and more evident that the Labour Party does not allow for different views, and every thought is valued from the position of whether it is acceptable to lead the party.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleges that I thought I had had similar political views began to expect that I would turn 180 degrees and accept positions that I would never agree with, whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- it's followed by a string of attacks in social networks, with calls for a renunciation, the condemnation of central politics, and I'm told that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know what I've been more fortunate than some of my colleges, because the comments I've had are usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face daily streams of sexist or racist attacks, but never refuse.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
Reality is that we are no longer such a big church, and with every movement of distrust or change in the rules of selection, the party is narrowing down.
For the last two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been told not to stand up, not to speak so loudly that I'm "all right."
But that's not why I went to politics.
I joined the labor force 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the lack of attention from the Tetcher government has literally broken down my high school class, since then I want to improve the quality of public service for those who need it most, whether it's a local adviser or a minister of government.
I never hid my policy, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been puzzled by my political views and differences with current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday's events, I just want to say one thing: in the context of a country marching to Brexit, which will harm the home, business, and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Nottingham Time, but for my campaigners, both members of the Labour Party, and not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of revoking me or any political advantage will prevent me from acting in line with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: the invincible Air rises up
The last two attempts may have misled the final result, but there is no doubt that Air has earned a triumph in today's wonderful entertainment match, the Prime Minister of Scotland.
Now they're heading the table, it's the only unsupervised team out of ten.
After all, the perfect defense and improved ability to take advantage of the chance gives the masters and coach Peter Merchi the full right to be content.
"We've been through our games so far, and we're still invincible, so I have to be content," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose commented, "I give due "Eir, they'd rather take the chance than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, carried out by Frazier Climo, led Air forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, released by Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Climo reinforced Air's leadership with a penalty and, right before the break, made and implemented a solo trial that gave a score of 17-5 for Air's sake.
But Melrose had a good start at the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the break to five points.
Afterwards, there was a prolonged delay due to the serious trauma of Rouard Knott, who was taken out of the field on the load, and from the restart of Air, they ran ahead with a try by Stafford McDowell, which was carried out by Climo.
Captain Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin under intense pressure.
The landlords returned, but when Strawan Hutchinson got a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the line of the penalty box, MacPherson made a touchdown behind the Moul Air.
Climo did an experiment that he did almost every time after reset, and then Kyle Rowe got a hit from David Armstrong in the box and sent a flanker to Gregor Henry at the fifth try of the host team.
Seems like the star of the "Already Game" series is set up for a new career in the restaurant realm
It looks like the star of the "Already Game" series, Ford Kieran, is set up for a new career in the field of hospitality. This is the conclusion that you can make after it is known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC TV series, a script he writes to and in which he shoots with an old comedy partner, Greg Hemfield.
Duyet announced that the future 9th series will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kirnan's planning a life after Craigslist.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmore Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source at the Scotish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter the "prosperous restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The Sea of Ours": Inside Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling a well-equipped fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings are hoisting an ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with a motto: “The sea is our right.
We have to get it back."
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline, which left Chile in the bloodthirsty conflict of the 19th century over natural resources, and the desire to swim again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1, after five years of trial.
“In Bolivia, there is an impulse, a spirit of unity and tranquillity, and, of course, it is looking for a positive result,” Roberto Calçacia, a Bolivian diplomat, commented.
Many Bolivians will watch the announcement of the ICF's decision on big screens all over the country, and they hope that the court in Gaas will take a decision in the interest of Bolivia, that after decades of intractable conversations, Chile will go to talks about giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his reconfiguration the following year, also puts great hope in the decision that will be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in Bolivia’s favor, and if it does, little will change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, does not have the power to condemn Chile’s territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision, taken only six months after the final argument was given, indicates that the case was “not complex”, told Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia's case has not progressed, but the last four years may have contributed to the relapse.
“The demand for access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
The war rhetoric of Morales blew up the remains of Chile’s benevolentness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Edouard Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in Haiti, disagreed that the court’s approval was uncommonly fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be “an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of Chile’s relationship and a chance to end the 139th year of differences by enjoying mutual benefit,” he said.
California also denied that Morales, still one of the most populous presidents of Latin America, used the issue of the sea as a politician.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
This decree is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says there's no nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the US.
Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho of North Korea says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the loneliness in Singapore by the leaders of the opponent countries.
His comments came out when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be at the point of relaunching nuclear diplomacy, which went to a deaf end more than three months after Singapore's loneliness with Kim Chen In.
Ri says that the belief that the continuation of the sanctions and the United States declaration of the end of the Korean War will one day put North Korea on its knees is a "incessant dream."
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and American president Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is a widespread scepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the abandonment of its arsenal, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second one between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion shows, the latest trend of massive main detergents is already on the main streets of your city
If you want to expand your hat collection or to hide completely from the sun, you've found what you need.
Valentino's designers and Tom Brown have shown a series of excentrical masterpieces in the Opera style from a spring-leave collection of 2019 at the podiums of the glamorous Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats filled Instagram this summer, and named designers have already sent their insatiable creations out of the area.
Valentino turned out to be an extravagant beige hat with wide-painted feathers covering the model's heads.
Among the rest of the oyster axes are decorated with precious coffee stones, a witch's hat, and even a pineapple's hat, but they're not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also showed an assortment of original masks — very in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One of the creatures was like an underwater floater with a tube and an eyeglass, and the other looked like a crack of ice that melted.
And if you support this serious fancy application, you're lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
The Operas-Capples have become fashionable thanks to the La Bomby, a straw hat with a field of 60 centimeters wide, which was seen on all, from Rianni to Emily Rataškowski.
The cultural brand, which is behind a very impractical hat that was seen everywhere in social networks, gave the world another creation: a straw-shaped beach bag of size almost as a model in a bathing suit that carried it.
A bag of yellow-red raffy with a rag of raffia and a white skin pen was the central element of a collection of La Riviera spring-literally 2019 brands of Jacquemus in the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "In the coming summer I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of the cities, because the designer's influence is so huge that it will be hard to ignore the demand for an ops-axis.
John Edward: Knowledge of the language is a duty to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain high standards of study, and in 2018 they again received excellent results from the individual and collective success of studies in sport, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which are attended by more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SHRS), who want to provide the best level of services for the students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for the further and higher education they have chosen to pursue, as well as to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language that she understands, she accepts it with her mind.
If you speak to her in her native language, she accepts it with her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the most recent results of this year's studies, we see that in independent schools, language is used in ratings of the best grades.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages scored a higher A.
Data from 74 schools in the SSRS showed that 72 percent of the students had a higher score of A from Chinese, and 72 percent from German, 69 percent from French, and 63 percent from Spanish, also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital to the life skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages as a choice subject are now taught in the same way as NTIM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), in independent school programs, and in other schools.
A 2014 British Jobs and Skills Commission survey revealed that 17% of the reasons why employers cannot close vacancies due to a lack of language skills.
So language skills are increasingly needed to train young people for a future career.
As more and more promising positions need to be taught languages, these skills are needed in a globalizing world.
Regardless of the choice of a career, if someone learns a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, because it's a life-long skill.
The possibility of direct communication with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks a number of languages the advantage of competitors.
According to a 2013 YouTube survey of over 4,000 British adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double percent (15 percent).
That's why investing in language teaching is now important to modern-day children.
Knowledge of a number of languages, especially those in developing countries, will provide children with more opportunities to find a full - time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn their own languages.
A series of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered to be the most important to the United Kingdom from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child in independent schools, it will always be possible to choose a number of languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scotland’s independent schools are trying to create an educational environment that prepares children and armes them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for them.
Now it can't be denied that in the international business environment, languages continue to be vital to a future country, so it should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as “the masters of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and perfection to Scottish youth.
Il faunt byen le faire.

Liebron debuts with the Lakers in San Diego
The fans who want to see the first start of L.A. James's Los Angeles Lakers are almost dead.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play on Sunday in the first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes it's gonna play, not yet decided.
“This will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
"Lakers" reporter Mike Trudell reported that James would play a limited number of minutes more quickly.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season games of the Lakers.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career for training," he replied.
Trump meetings in West Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump is opening a series of pre-election meetings today from the city of Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trump meetings scheduled for next week, including those in the friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy he offered to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump wants to form support for future mid-town elections, as the Republics risk losing control of the Congress after voting in November.
What time will the evening Trump's meeting in West Virginia take place today, and how will we view it on the Internet?
Trump's meeting in the city of Wiling, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 hours in the east today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below on YouTube.
Trump is probably referring to the strains of the hearing this week over a candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, who is charged with sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate's vote for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans to gain popularity before the November elections.
President Trump's representatives said that the five meetings next week were aimed at “activation of volunteers and supporters, as the Republics are trying to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters reports.
“The control of the Congress is so critical to its day order that the president will go to as many states as possible, as the turbulent pre-electoral campaign season is coming,” said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign, who did not want to call his name.
At the Vesbanko Arena Stadium in Wiling, today's rally can be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as by the media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, where he won over 40% of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate from the Republicans to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisy, whose ratings are behind the polls.
“ This is not good for Morrisy, who the president is coming to raise his ratings in the polls, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: the U.S. team is geared up to fight and is filled with hope for Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended in a one-sided victory, the Saturday forsaw can be exactly what this Ryder Cup was missing.
The swing pendulum of the impulse is a completely fictional sporting concept that the players really believe in, especially in similar games.
So when do they say the pulse works?
“They were six points ahead, and now four, so I think we're taking it a little bit like a pulse,” Jordan Spit said when he left.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spit says, feel a bit of wind in their windmills, and they're also encouraged by a lot, not lastly by the Spit and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and each has earned three out of four.
Spit and his killer blows from the midget to the game show an example.
These lary cries of the celebrations became louder when, in the continuation of his round, he made a decisive patch and levelled the score at the fourth match after he and Thomas had been two points behind.
His path, which allowed them to win a match on 15 holes, met with a similar scream, one that tells you that the American team doesn't seem.
“You really just have to try hard and worry about your own game,” Spit said.
That's all each of these players left now.
18 holes to be known.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, are the uncontested history of the Ryder Cup.
It's unusual, but a charming couple in Europe has four out of four and can't make any mistakes.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't make a godgie on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to escape a godgie on Saturday morning and after lunch on Friday and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This race, and the way their energies seem to flow to this turbulent crowd and back, makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players, other than Fleetwood or Molinari, to secure the potential victory of the Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Both are desirable at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the European triumph.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson got off with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning foreballs, when he was in a couple with Alex Noren.
One bog and two dabs on the first nine holes led the Spaniard and the Swede to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to watch foreballs and foresoms close to each other because of the interaction between the couple's members, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the interest in seeing how strategies can change in a moment.
So far, Europe is playing better than a team and has a significant advantage in the last day, but this session of forsemics has also shown that the U.S. team is going to fight, in which some, especially Americans, are doubting.
Europe is leading with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Rider Cup, Europe will have a common advantage, for after Saturday's forbes and fores, it outstrips the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood's duet and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the lost Tiger Woods, and now on Le Golf National they have four scores.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to return the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning forges with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. was more uptight in the forsoms and won two games, but it was not possible to shorten the breakup.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Mollinari (one Mallywood) after a sensational weekend are just the second pair who scored four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
Breaking up Woods and Patrick Reed in forbols, they united to beat the swelling Woods and the new American Bryson Deshambo with an even more effective 5th-4.
Woods, who pulled out two games on Saturday, was displaying random splashes of genius, but he now lost 19 of his 29 games in forballs and fors and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who didn't take part in the morning forballs, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in the forsoms to get a 2-to-1 score from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopki, which is the first and third of the world's ratings.
Europe couldn't do it in its own way this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
The three main winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two points.
They won a decisive victory over the Spaniards, John Ram and Ian Polter, in the forbols, and later beat Polter and Rory McLray with a score of 403 in the fors, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned with a four-point deficit in the singles, although Furik's team needed nothing to save the trophy.
After the second place in two days, however, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it can't.
North Korea says that "no way" will be disarmed in one-sided order without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of the sanctions deepens mistrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country will never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations General Assembly that last year North Korea had adopted “unexpected measures of good will”, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the right reaction from the US," he said.
“Untrusting the US will not be our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to disarm in a one-sided manner.”
And while Ri repeated North Korea’s familiar complaints about the Washington “stage” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for the step-by-step steps, his claim was important because it did not reject the one-sided denuclearization that Pyongyang had made in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen In and Donald Trump on the first-ever stand-up between the real US president and North Korea's leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called on him to work on the “declaration of the Korean Peninsula,” and Trump promised a security guarantee to North Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on "declaration at the beginning" and increases the level of pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even denies "the end of the war," Ri said.
“Consider that the sanctions can put us on our knees, ” is the unfulfilled dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the extension of the sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans of the second one between Kim and Trump, to which the U.S. leader had emphasized at the UN early in the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If South Korea, not the United States, was the party to the issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have gone into such a deaf place.”
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from that of the General Assembly when he told the General Assembly that the North Korean missile attack on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after the “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” who wanted to commit suicide.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “make a complete kill” for North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking action on disarmament, but said that much more needed to be done and that the sanctions should remain in force until North Korea deuclarized.
On Wednesday, Trump observed that he did not set a time frame for this: "It will take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But US Superintendent Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue with energy and without hindrance until we see a complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.
The Security Council has once again increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block the financing of nuclear and ballist rockets to Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that the next month he was visiting Pyongyang again to prepare for the second one.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but after a few hours, North Korea convicted him of “gangster demands. ”
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States is using “the appropriate measures”.
He said that, according to Kim, he needed “adversarial measures” to guarantee the security that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps to normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard this year provided all of his students with more sleep, an attempt to combat the growing culture of coolness of learning all night after refueling the caffeine.
The professor found that university number one students in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigam Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on his studies.
At the end of the day, a girl approached him and said, "Why am I being told this in the final class?"
“She told her that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” said a professor at The Telegraph.
In the course that was first introduced this year, students are taught the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sporting results, as well as to improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and an executive director of medical services at the University, said that the University had decided to introduce the course after it had been discovered that the students had been seriously sleepless for a week.
The one-time course includes a series of interactive to-dos.
In one section, there's an image of a room in a community, where students click cups of coffee, curtains, coaches, and books to learn about the impact of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deficiency on sports, and the importance of routines associated with sleep.
Another chapter tells participants how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the interactive icon map encourages the participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Chesler.
A culture of pride for “singing all night” still exists, he added, and also pointed out that modern technology and the ever-growing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is on the rise.
Sufficient sleep of good quality must be the student's “secret weapon” to deal with stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, even with a set of overweights, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of hunger, which causes permanent physical hunger, he said.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped professor Chasler to develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year at Harvard's first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all aspirants to attend a similar training program before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chessler advises students to remind them to go to bed, to set up an alarm and to be aware of the harmful effect of the “blue light” that e-screens and LED lamps have and that can interfere with the circadian rhythm, which causes problems with swelling.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal emboldened Gerrard's boys
Rangers suffered a queuing attack of grief: a strike by Dolly Menga led to a different team of Steven Gerrard's defeat with a score of 1-0 from Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first win at the race after the lute triumph over St. Johnston with a score of 4-1, but the Gary Holt team scored Gerrard the second as manager of 18 games. Gerrard's team left eight points behind the Scottish Premiership Harts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, which lacked inspiration, didn't look like it could even the score.
Now, "Rengers are down to the sixth position, and Livingstone is up to the third position, and by the difference of the ball, they're just ahead of the Hibernian.
In addition, the Rangers may have another problem, as the lineman Kalum Spence was forced to process the head wound after he was thrown into the guest sector with an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that had once hit Air in the half-finals of the Scots League Cup.
And Holt released the same set of "Livie 11", which took one point at the Harts last week, and was thrilled by the way his wrenched guys put up rivals at each end.
The Rangers may have been dominant in the power of the ball, but Livingston was working more with the ball.
They were to kill in just two minutes of the game, when the first pass of Menga in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gates of Allan McGregor, but the half-defendant was wasted this big chance by sending a ball over the gate.
Deep free blow Keahan Jacobs got to Skipper Craig Hulket, but his defense partner Alan Litgow hit the back pants
Rangers did get control, but on the last third there was more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should be entitled to a penalty at the mark of a quarter of an hour after a collision with Stephen Lawless, but the referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers managed to hit only two of the gates in the first half, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper, Liam Kelley, was hit by the head of Lassana Kulibali and the quiet strike by Ovije Jejaria was hardly disturbed.
And while the 34-minute outpost of Livingston may have been in conflict with the game, no one can deny that they just earned it with their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' preparations.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who peacefully chose Menga for a simple end.
In the break, Gerrard replaced the Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the vinger got to Morelos, but the astonishing Kelley got out of his line to block it.
However, Livingston continued to force the guests to play the same game they liked when Litgow and Halkett made one long pass after the other.
Holt's team was able to improve the results at the last stage, but McGregor was very good at resisting Jacobs before Litoue hit out of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for Rangers, made another late application for a penalty when he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson looked back.
Almanach: Geiger's Inventor
And now our Sunday morning page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the time is coming... a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm, Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as Geiger's meter.
From that time on, Geiger became one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example, in the 1950 film "Call the Coronado" with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play doubtful cowboys.
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's number, which is used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on those headphones, you can really hear the effect that radioactivity in minerals has on atoms.
Evans: "Oh, wow, it's really cracking right now!"
"Gans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to detect malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method is to remove the immune cells from the patient and change them in the lab.
Then these cells are able to "see" proteins, which is common to many types of cancer, and then these cells are injecting the patient again.
The test vaccine shows many promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who had received a vaccine that taught the immune system to detect malignant cells, ovarian cancer had disappeared for over 18 months.
The method is to remove the immune cells from the patient, to change them in the lab so that the cells can "see" common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and to continue to reintroduce these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski of the United States National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorful cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which is to remove immune cells in patients and to “teach” them to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
After the show SNL was introduced to the studio in the MAGA baseball game, Kanye West tucked out with a sharp speech to support President Trump,
the negative reaction of the viewers
The audience at the SNL (Sunday Night in Direct Episode) was taught by Kanye after his sad speech, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he was going to run for the presidency in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town, in a baseball cap labeled "Return America's Former Fame," he exploded with a tirade of criticizing the Democrats, and again claimed his support for Trump.
"A lot of white people talk to me, "how do you like Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if racism bothered me, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Juridical Committee in the case of Christine Blazey Ford's sexual assault.
Although West's speech was not broadcast in the direct air, Chris Rock's social media comic video with his tirade.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to mock West by posting this post.
West also complained to the viewers that there was an unpleasant situation behind the barn because of the main cleanup.
According to the Washington Examiner, West said, "When I was behind the bars, I was brutally treated.
I was told, "Don't go to the viewers in this baseball cap."
They bullied me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed are quiet."
West continued, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are quiet? I'm gonna put on my superman cap because so no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to the weekly Variety, his comments at least twice provoked a negative reaction of the audience in the room, and the actors in the SNL show looked lost, and one of the viewers said, "The studio was in the hands of dead silence."
Westa was last asked to replace Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Reper McMiller, died a few days before the Ether.
The West caused many surprises by performing the song I Love it (I love it) in the suit of a bottle of water Perrier.
Westa was supported by the head of the conservative organization TPUSA Kendace Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the most daring:
Instead, the speaker of the talk show, Karen Gunther, tweeted that the West "is who he is, and that's just great."
"On the contrary, I will not reward him (buying his music or his dress or supporting his art) who, I think, professes and casts out the ideology that harms my community.
He's a free man.
Like us,' she added.
Prior to the show's performance, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name: he was now "the one who was previously known as Kanye West."
West is not the first artist to change his name, but he's following the example of Grandpa, also known as Puff Grandpa, Puffy, and Pi Grandpa.
Snoop Dog's collegiant used to be called Snoop Lyon, and as we know, the music legend of the last decades, Prince, has changed the name to a symbol, and then became "The Artist, Formerly known as Prince."
Charged for wilful murder after a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with having been deliberately killed after having stabbed another man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported the incident at the Belligecamor restaurant.
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will look into the charges.
The Star of the Grey of Thrones series, Keith Gerington, denies the idealization of bruteness.
Keith Guerington became famous for the role of a soldier with the sword of John Snow in the ruthless medieval Phenthic series "The Grave of Thrones" of HBO.
However, a 31-year-old actor denounced the stereotype of a hero-macho, saying that because of such heroes on screens, it often seems to young guys that they need to be cool enough to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said that "something went wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing bruteness in the era of popularity of the hashtag #Meto (#en, #eve, etc.).
The whale, who recently married his college on the Grey Thrones, a 31-year-old actor, Rose Lesley, said that he was "so determined" to deal with the problem.
"I'm at the moment pretty determined, when did we get to the slippery way of idealizing bruteness?" he asked.
"What do we teach future men if we look at their growing up from the perspective of the problem we see now?"
The whale believes that TV is partly responsible for popularizing bruteness through images of extremely courageous heroes.
He continued, "What is natural, and what are we being planted?
Why does the TV and the street teach that young boys are under pressure to be such men?
I think today's really important question is, "How do we change this?"
'Cause it's obvious that the young guys are out of the right way."
In an interview, he also pointed out that he would not be filming in any prequel and sicwells of "Greats of the Thrones" after the end of the show the next summer, because "he's already done with the battles and the horses."
As of November, the whale will play "The Real West" by Sem Shepard, the story of the film producer and his raptor brother.
As the actor recently admitted, he considers the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best he's ever had in "The Grave of Thrones."
"From the time of the filming in this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and defined my life," said the whale.
In a fantastic series that won the Emmy award, Rose played the game, the love of the hero Gerington John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018, and the ceremony was held in Lesley's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a sharp 14% increase in new cases
In China, a sharp 14 - percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS was reported.
According to health authorities, there are more than 820,000 people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted by sex, which is a sign of a change in the past.
For a long time, in some parts of China, HIV was rapidly spread through infected blood during transfusions.
However, as the official health authorities said during the Yunnan conference, the number of people who are infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero.
Compared to the previous year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The temporary sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT people often suffer from discrimination.
According to studies, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men later marry women because of the country's prevalence of conservative values.
In most cases, the transmission occurs as a result of the improper use of protective devices during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV treatment, seeing it as a way to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the flow of data from senators-respondents online by her full-time employee and criticizes the "insecure lie" and the "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, a member of the United States House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, denounced the allegation that one of her full-time employees had posted the personal data of three American senators-rescue on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that these statements spread "Ultra-rights" political viewers and websites.
"Little, lying, and then even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
According to reports, the public information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing before the Senate Commission, alleging criminal acts of a sexual nature committed against Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The data flowed some time after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
The Hill has reported that conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have revealed that the IP address of the outflow is linked to the Waters office and that it was possible to locate the data of its full-time co-worker.
"These unsubstantiated claims, absolute untrue, do not correspond to reality," Waters went on.
"The half-worker of my office, whose personal data and security are at risk as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has no bearing on the flow of this information.
These unsubstantiated assertions are absolute untrue, they do not correspond to reality."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the web, and among others, the former White House Press Secretary, Ari Fleisher, was quoted.
"This denial is filled with anger," wrote Fleisher.
"This suggests that, with that character, she cannot be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he did not do, he does not need to get angry.
The accused should not be dishonest.
He should not ask about the motive of the accuser.
He must remain calm and unstoppable."
It looks like Fleisher was running parallels between Waters' reactions and the Democrat critics at Judge Cavanaugh's address, who was accused of being too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is trying to take Waters' place after the results of the inter-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is the news, if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had already informed "the responsible state and law enforcement bodies of these false claims."
"We will do our best to find the guilty," she continued, "and they answered the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of the film "Agent Johnny Inglish: New Mission" – a pass-by parade for spying with Rowan Atkinson
It's already a good tradition to look in every new British movie for Braxit's ideas, and they're in a new part of a series of comedy jokes for the Johnny Inglish fighters, and the first film, "Johnnie Inglish", was released in 2003, and later re-engineered in 2011 with "Johnnie Inglish: restarting".
Will the ironic and ironic self-satisfaction of what we are a misguided, new export potential of the nation?
One way or another, Johnny Inglish, with his moving face and glutted eyes, had the second chance to make a mess, with his name more than anything, to indicate that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As we know, Johnny is a wildly fun secret agent, in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, is a bit from Inspector Clouseau, a bit from Mr. Beene, and a lot of things – from the guy who played one note of the "Fire chariots" movie at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The character is also foreshadowed by a traveler and an international puzzle that has always left behind the mess that Atkinson had played in the long-forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard.
In the last film about Johnny Inglish, there are a few good moments.
I loved the scene when Johnny Inglish, in his uniforms, was approaching the helicopter, and the shovels of the pendant day on his helmet.
In the film, Atkinson's talent to set up a bouphonade is very well revealed, but humor is passable, and in some respects too much, especially when compared to "serious" films, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible", one of the "Ingredients" of which is also a comedy.
It seems to me that jokes are more focused on children than on adults, and I'm not as ingenious and thought-provoking as atkinson's obsessive Bin films.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
The British super-secret spy network is infiltrated by a hacker and uncovers the names of all field agents, which has become a total surprise to an active agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon only played an episodic role in the film).
This has proved to be the last stage for the Prime Minister, a proud person who has already been subjected to murderous criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson has tried to best convey the image that Teresa Mei has given, but the script has not been able to fully uncover it).
Intelligence counselors have informed her that all active agents have been compromised, and she needs to involve one of the retired.
The choice falls on the unspeakable Johnny Inglish, who is now a teacher at some super-mode school, and informally teaches children to work under cover (in this part with the spy "year's school" Inglish was a few good jokes for teenagers).
The Inglisha is rushed to Whitehall for a short-term breeze, where he meets again with his long-suffering buddy Buff, who is in turn playing Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of an exultant person does not exactly match the talent of Vicky Pepperdin).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went squeaky, the Batman and the Robin are back in line and suddenly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletov, who is playing Olga Kurilenko.
And at this time, the prime minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire, who has earned his wealth in technology and technology, and claims that he can fix the problem with the British network, the vicious Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Buff go on a trip and re-enter their funny boots: they're re-dressed by waiters, they're setting a fire in a fancy French restaurant; then they're sowing chaos, illegally traveling abroad on Volta's luxurious yacht; Inglish's setting up a real mess when he's trying to use the virtual reality helm to get to know how to plan the Volt's house.
All the stops lead us to the last epic, but by their kindness and fury, it is something like a movie for children.
A live movie.
As I was looking at other films about Johnny Inglish, I asked myself the same question: Can't the British film industry offer Rowen Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Laborers deny the preparation of a plan according to which the British will work four days a week, but they'll get a paycheck in five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party has to discuss a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but they'll get a paycheck in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to obligate the managers of the companies to transfer the money saved by the revolution of artificial intelligence to the employees, giving them an extra weekend.
In this way, the workers will have a three-day weekend and bring home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea will be in line with the party's economic programme and direct the country's resources to support the working class.
The shift to a four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of the Third Union, and it is expected that the workers will be able to benefit from a change in the global situation.
A source at the Labour Party reported to The Sunday Times: "Policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week is in line with the Party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party.
The laborers were not the first to accept this idea, as the Green Party had promised to introduce a four-day working week during the pre-electoral campaign of 2017.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment are in favor of such a desire.
The Speaker of the Labour Party said, "The party's political agenda does not provide for a four-day working week, so we're not looking at it now."
"The Dark" chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at last week's pre-elective meeting of the Labour Party.
Mr. McDonnell claimed that he was set up to take back power from the "faceless directors" of the Communal Industries and the "visitors."
The plan of the "shadow" chancellor also means that water companies may not get all of their share of the capital if the labor government introduces a "counter" on the basis of perceived infractions.
He also confirmed his intention to include employees in the management of companies and to set up inclusive equity funds to pass 10 percent of the private sector's shares to the workers, who are expected to have a yearly divide of up to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lyndsey Grame and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes (60 minutes), or can the Cavanaugh case, which leads the FBI, change their mind
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh, who is in charge of the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court has been postponed at least a week, and the question arises whether the senators of the press will continue to support Cavanaugh after the results of the Bureau's investigation have been published.
On Sunday's 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelli asked the senators of John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened and the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you really do it?"
He was determined, firm, uncompromising."
It seems that Graham’s mind will no longer change.
"I think the Kavanaugh indictment is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," he added by Gray, talking to Christine Blazey Ford.
And everyone she calls can't prove it under oath.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't know what can change."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect the decline in poverty?
On this Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the music world with a staggering number of star performers and an equally devastating mission – to fight poverty all over the world.
During the seventh festival, the Global Citizen Festival will crowd tens of thousands of people in the Grand Gaul of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendez, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival – the organizers want to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global People Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors have to do a number of jobs or "acts", like taking a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to the world's leader, making a phone call or something to help draw attention to the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results, since the Global Sitizen organizers have 12 years left to achieve the target?
Is it really the idea of rewarding the actions of a free concert - a genius way to convince people to do something, is it just another case of so-called "clictionism" when people feel that something is really changing by signing an e-mail petition or by making a Tweet?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million "acts" of their supporters, aiming at different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to claim more than $37 billion in planned funding and programs that will help to change the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group gave an example of 390 financial obligations and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to the group's estimates, some 649 million people around the world have been directly affected.
Among the major financial obligations are the Power of Nutrition Foundation, which is territorially linked to the United Kingdom. In the framework of the project, investors and implementers committed themselves to "helping the children to grow up" and promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to deal with the problem of undernutrition after they had received more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"For the support of the British government, mecents, governments of other countries, and citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social problem of undernourishment a small fact of history," said a representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulllman, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that, after 5,000 “acts” that called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the British government had announced the allocation of funds to the Power of Nutrition project, which was aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "What do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote, "It's a long and hard way, so sometimes we're gonna fall, and we're gonna get a failure.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, band The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Jianelle Mona, is just part of the star performers this year at the New York festival, and will weigh Deborah-Lee Fernez and Hugh Jackman.
The Minister of Internal Affairs stated that the US can use the Navy for the "block" to prevent the export of Russian energy.
According to the U.S. Minister of Internal Affairs, Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, Washington can "for the need" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it works to invite a legitimate government, is a reason to explore new power sources.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to be a medium in the energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the manager, there are ways and means of solving the problem.
"The U.S. Navy can provide free passage by sea routes and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the members of the event, which was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that holds itself as the "voice of each consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare the approach to trade with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they were in fact similar.
“The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy efficiently and replace it with alternatives,” he said, calling Russia “singlely developed,” because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While Trump’s administration was listening to these allegations, it was intended to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by displacing the Russian energy market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To that end, Trump's administrators and President Donald Trump themselves are trying to convince the German government to abandon the “impermissible” construction project of the North Flux 2, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Northflow 2 gas pool, which is worth $11 billion, will double the capacity of existing gas to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
The Kremlin is convinced that Washington is very opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of dishonest competition.
"In my view, we share the view that energy can't be a tool of pressure, and the consumer should be able to choose the suppliers," said the Russian minister of energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with the U.S. minister of power, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The US position led to a negative reaction by Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization of the Federal Union of the German Industry (BDI) has urged the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bipartisan agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempff, head of the Federal Union of the German Industry, after the last German chancellor Angela Merkel met Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Vorrene "will seriously think" about running for president in 2020.
The senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Vorren, said on Saturday that he was going to "think seriously" about running for president after an inter-elective election.
During a meeting with the public in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of standing for election.
According to The Hill Vorrene, "The time for women to go to Washington to set up the government, and for that to happen, there must be a woman in his head."
"After November 6th, I will seriously think about putting up my candidacy for president."
During her meeting with the public, Warren expressed her appreciation of the presidency of Donald Trump, saying that he "will lead his country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Vorren was open, criticizing Trump and his nomination for the post of Judge of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh.
In Friday's tweet, Warren wrote, "...of course, the FBI has to conduct an investigation before voting."
However, according to the polls published on Friday, most of Vorren's polls do not believe that it should run in 2020.
In line with a joint survey conducted by the University of Suffolk Center for Political Studies and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential voters in the state of Massachusetts expressed their opposition to the senator's nomination.
Thirty-two percent supported the removal.
The results of the poll showed that the former Governor, Deval Patrick, had more support, and that 38 percent, against 48 percent, had been expressed for his potential presidentship.
During the discussions on the candidacy of other prominent Democrats who may be running in 2020, former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator in Vermont Bernie Sanders are also called.
According to Assocated Press, Biden said he'd make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions the PTSD of Track Palin during a rally to support Donald Trump.
The 26-year-old Treque Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through right now, what he's going through after his return, can only be understood by the other families that are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are coming home with," she said in front of a rally to support Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called Trac's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "were coming home not the same as before, more brutal, and want to know if they respect what they've done here as brothers of soldiers, pilots, and other military personnel for this country."
According to a spokesman for the police department in Wasillah, Den Bennett, Trac was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as obstructing the report of the incident of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol.
18 states and the district of Colombia support a claim of shelter policy
Eighteen states and a district of Colombia support a complaint against the new US policy, according to which victims of banditry and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts sent an analytical note to the court's consultant in Washington to support a lender who needed shelter and complained to the court about the policy in question.
The full name of the lender in the case of Grace v. Sechens, called the American Union for the Defence of Civil Rights, which complains of federal politics and was filed in August, is not open.
The client claimed that her partner "and his brutal son-bandits" beat her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for shelter on July 20.
It was illegally held in Texas.
Public prosecutors, who support Grace's suit, have said that the inhabitants of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees who often ask for shelter in the United States) often face serious problems, such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status overturned the decision of the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board, according to which undocumented immigrants who had fled domestic violence could request refuge.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, General Carl Reysin, stated on Friday's speech that the new policy “noted decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that the decision on the application for refugee status be based on a review of the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle,” is the case in the Court's counsel's analytical note.
In the analytical note, the prosecutors argue that the policy that bans immigrants from entering the United States harms the economy of the country, as they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "full the necessary labour resources."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sechens issued an order to the immigration judges that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
“The shelter is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with race, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views,” said Ceshnes at the time of the presentation of the politician on June 11.
The provision of shelter was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
The rescuers are desperately trying to find the survivors, while the death toll in Pale has doubled
For those who have survived, the situation continues to worsen.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, soothing her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palau.
"Every moment, quick help brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water."
Some people go back to their destroyed homes, take over the flooded benefits, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people are traumatized, and hospitals that have been damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 points on the Richter scale are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including the two Geris with a fractured back and shoulder, rest near the building of the Pala Army Hospital, where patients are given help in the open sky through constant repulsions.
His eyes filled with tears when he remembered how a strong push hit the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I've been cramped in the midst of the walls,” said Geris to correspondent Assocated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife beg for help, and then held quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "reducing psychological pressure" by means of "advertising that contains propaganda."
A week after the Chinese national newspaper had put four pages of American daily adverts on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda.
US President Donald Trump, last midday, referred to a fee-paying China Daily supplement in Des Moins Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to influence the elections to the Congress on November 6, China rejects the charges.
According to the Reuters official in the United States, Trump’s claims that he's accusing Beijing of trying to interfere with American elections mean a new phase of excerpt from Washington, the target of which is pressure on China.
While foreign governments can post commercials to boost trade, there is a trade war between Beijing and Washington at the time, in which they have already raised the import toll.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the establishment of a repressive tower in China was intended to strike exporters from such states as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, the U.S. ambassador to China, and the former governor of the state of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural produce to China, claimed that China had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in the column of Des Moins Register Sunday, "enhances pressure by publishing propaganda ads in our independent press."
"In order to spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American people's tradition of free speech and free press, putting up a fee-paying advert in Des Moins Register," writes Brenstead.
"On the other hand, on the street layouts here in Beijing, you're only looking for individual voices of different sorts, and you're not going to see a true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is a source of concern, which is the conclusion that the Chinese MILITARY is under the credible control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the respectful Chinese editions offered to publish" his article, but did not name it.
Analysts warn that the failure of Cavanaugh's Republicans set up women voters against themselves before the mid-electives.
Since many prominent Republicans support and defend a candidate for the post of Justice of the Supreme Court, Britta Cavanaugh, after being charged with a number of charges of sexual harassment, the analysts warn that this may trigger an unwelcome reaction to future inter-elections, particularly in women.
This situation is surrounded by passion, and most Republicans state publicly that they would like to move on to a vote.
This kind of thing can't just be played back," he said in an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Reger, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse.
Rieger doubted that the FBI investigation, which was the last moment that Senator Jeff Flake (respublisher from Arizona) insisted on it, would be enough to calm the angered voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the head counselor and resource person of the progressing MoveOn group (Keep moving on), Katrin Jean-Perrier said on Friday, "The women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mick, on Friday morning, protesters sang "Listrop's Coming!" during a demonstration at the Juridical Committee, when the Republics decided to move to the confirmation of Cavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blazey Ford's testimony.
In an interview with the news website, Stu Rotenberg, an outside political observer, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"It's said to be so now, and it's true.
However, motivation may increase, especially in 18- to 29-year-old female voters, with predominances that have not yet been defined and often do not vote if they do not like the president.
Even before Ford gave evidence in connection with the charges against a candidate for the position of a Supreme Court judge for a sexual offence, analysts predicted a negative reaction to the polls if the Republics insisted on confirmation.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, the former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, said, "This is a bad story for the Republican Party."
In an interview with the news, the Director of Priorities USA (groups that help the Democrats' campaign) Guy Cecil said, "it's not about voting the committee, voting the final vote, or how Cavanaugh got caught up on the charges, but how they reacted to the situation and how they went on to act."
Still, Americans' thoughts about who they believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, have been divided, and Ford has a little more support.
According to a new YouTube poll, 41 percent of the respondents believe or are more likely to believe in Ford's testimony, while Cavanaugh's testimony either believes or is more likely to believe 35 percent of the respondents.
In addition, 38 percent of the interviewees said that they thought Cavanaugh was giving, or more likely giving, false testimony, while 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI, after insisting on Flake, is vetting the charges that Ford and another levyer, Deborah Ramirez, have been removed.
Last week Ford testified under oath to the Senate Juridical Committee about how Cavanaugh had attacked her while in a state of alcohol abuse when she was 17.
Ramirez stated that the candidate for the position of Judge of the Supreme Court had shown her his genitals at the party during their studies at the University of Jella in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global Internet is planning to start a "new Internet" to create a Google and Facebook competition.
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the global Internet, is launching a new startup to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the world's legend of technology, Inrupt, is developing a platform with an open source Solid, an idea that belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users can choose where to store the data and who to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the Inrupt target was "world rule."
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
It's a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid technology, which will enable users to create a "personal online data repository" or POD.
It can store contact lists, lists of current cases, a calendar, an audio library, and other tools for its own use and operation.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify at the same time.
A unique feature of this personal online repository is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities by means of data."
According to the Director General of Inrupt, John Bruce, the company is intent on putting in place resources, processes, and appropriate skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
So far, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, a number of regular developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world can create their own self-contained applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all their business models experience radical changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
On Saturday's Media Burners-Lee, he wrote that the Inrupt mission was "to provide commercial energy and ecosystem and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners-Lee is an influential figure in the debate about online neutrality.
Even during the launch of the Inrupt Berners-Lee, he was the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I look very optimistly at the next era of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vanne: Commemoration of the Church of the Order of Victoria in the Years of World War I
The only representative of the Church of England who received the Order of the Church of Victoria for taking part in the war during the First World War is honored in his hometown after 100 years.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was rewarded for participating in the Battle of Belnglis and Leocourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper's bullet four days later and never learned that he had received the highest military reward in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a monumental stone during a parade in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vanne, called "uniquely symbolic" that the discovery of the monumental stone took place just 100 years after his grandfather had made a feat for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann transferred his batalion via the St. Katen Channel "over a very dense mist and under the dense fire of the field gun and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the fire line, and with "sudden courage" led the line forward, before that one broke into the field cannon, and destroyed three flames of an enemy subdivision.
Lt. Col. Vanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – a little more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vanne said that his grandfather had done something that he would never have been able to do again and that deserved to be respected.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vanne, put a crown after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vanne said that "he feels very proud to be involved in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is shown by the respect that so many people show him."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they were shown "Pig Peppa."
Imagine that you don't sleep all night just to watch Bellator 206, and you're not allowed to view the main event.
There were 13 battles in the post office in San José, including six main program members, who were aired live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just before Gegard Musisi and Rory McDonald were ready to join up in a fight, the United Kingdom's viewers died of surprise when Peppa's pig appeared on the screen instead of the fight.
Some of the viewers were not thrilled because they had not slept until the morning, waiting for a fight.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him "some kind of bad joke."
"According to the government's decree of content, which was broadcast at 6:00 a.m., it was inconvenient, so they had to let the children's show," said Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president of marketing and public relations to Bellator, when he was asked for a TV show,
Peppa Pig, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, promised to work on the broadcast schedule to cover the audiences in the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think that if we talk about repeating the broadcast, we can do it," said Coker.
"But it's Sunday, 6:00 a.m., and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and it's Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the broadcast was shut off, we got a lot of messages we were responding to, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it turned out to be an incompatibility with government orders.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to shorten the tour to five instead of six, as usual, and we've been trying to redirect the signal to fans, but we've been putting it off so far.
It's a really bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jump in the water, Tom Daley, tells us that he was growing up, feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him motive to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't know that "not all look like him" until he went to high school.
Taking part in the Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he pointed out that he had openly expressed gay rights to give hope to others.
He also claimed that because of his fatherhood, he was less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
A longtime host, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for a few months.
After coming as a couple for the first Laverne program, Daley claimed to have felt "bader" than others in his childhood, because "the community didn't like boys and girls."
He said, "To this time, the feeling of less cost and difference was exactly what gave me the power and the power to succeed."
According to him, he wanted to prove that something was "back," so as not to disappoint all those who had finally learned about his orientation.
The double bronze Olympic Prior became a well-known LBHT-rights activist and used this year's Commonwealth Games to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was frank about his views, because he was happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and he wanted to give this hope to others.
A three - time world champion admitted that his feelings for the man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 were a real surprise to him.
Dalei went out with the winner of the Oscar Award, the 20-year-old, last year, but, according to him, the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at this young age" (at the first Olympics he performed at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also survive a similar fall.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and since then, according to Daley, his "world perception" has changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, I'd only think about what should get gold," he said.
"You know, there are things far more important than the Olympic Gold Medals.
My Olympic gold is Robby."
His son was named by his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said that his father couldn't accept the idea of the end, and before he died, he asked him if they had bought tickets to the London Olympics 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, "you won't be in the front row, 'cause you won't be around anymore," said Dale.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daly took part in the 2012 Olympics and acquired bronze.
"I knew that that was what I had dreamed of my whole life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no better feeling than that," said Dale.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song, Proud, in the performance of Heather Small, which resonated with him during the preparation for the Olympic Games and is still causing ants.
Desert Island Discs is released on Sunday 4 at 11.15 p.m. in English.
On Saturday, from the tournament match, Michaelson, who was not in uniform, was led by Ryder's Cup.
American Phil Mikkelson set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th tour game for the Ryder Cup, but it has to restore the form so that this event will not be a disaster for him.
Michaelson, who is a record 12th member of a tour that takes place every two years, took Captain Jim Furyk out of the game at the time of the forbes and forsmas.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner had been encouraging the team all day and training on the side, hoping to master his emotions.
Because Michaelson was not famous for the appropriate blows, even when he was in the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete was not exactly fit for a complex golf field, Le Golf National, where the raft usually punishes for the slippery blows.
And if it's not that hard, on Sunday's 9th match, Michaelson will have to meet the Open Champion and the Master of the exact strike by Francesco Molinari, who, together with the new Tommy Fleetwood, won all of his games this week.
If Americans who are behind three points after 12 singles start well, the Michaelson game can be decisive.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his athlete, and he probably had nothing to add to that.
"He fully understood his role today, shuddered me on the back, hugged me, and said that tomorrow would be ready," said Furik.
"He has no doubt about his powers.
Michaelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, which did so much for the teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I predicted more games, but that's how it worked, so we decided to do it.
He wants to be in the field like anyone else."
If Michaelson goes to the field on Saturday, Nick Faldo's record, who played the highest number of games in the Cup of Ryder.
He might be able to complete his career at the Cup of Ryder, which never matched his individual achievement.
Michaelson's account is 18 wins, 20 defeats, and 7 no results, but Furik said that his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's a guy who's cool with having a team," Furik explained.
"I think the younger players had a good time riding on it, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big break doesn't solve anything
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the feeling of a single match before the last day of the tour for the Ryder Cup has yet to guarantee a win.
Denmark debuted in 1997 in a game on the field of the Walderram Club, where the team led with Sev Ballesteros ahead of the Americans by five points, but won the match with a small break with a score of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in a game at the Walderram field; a big break at the Brookline where we lost, and at the Walderram field where we were forced to win," said Bjorn after a review of the wins of Class 2018 with a score of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break is 10:6.
So history teaches me and every player in the team that nothing has yet been resolved.
We have to play with maximum return tomorrow.
Go out to the field and do whatever you need to do.
The game will not be finished until the result is on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I'm focusing on 12 of our team, but we know very well who stands up to us, the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a complex field, Bjorn added, "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow things can be different.
We're looking for a personal match tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's cool to play field with a partner when things go well, but just when you're standing there alone, and you can check out what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to configure the players to perform tomorrow: at the limit of opportunity.
You're leaving your partner with no support, and now he's got to show you what he can do."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number, Jim Furic, expects his partners to play a better game at the individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Up to Furik's last day, the fate was back by different sides: he was among the winners in Brookline, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created "The Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, organized the players before the last day of the race.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, like it was in Brookline and Medina.
When the initiative shifts to a side, the players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We've properly positioned the players in the team, as if we're going to, like, do something incredible tomorrow."
Thomas is charged with trying to lead the counter-attack in the top-match against Rory McElroy, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Polter are on the top half of the European team.
"These partners are the ones that I chose in this order because I want to share the effort in an even-handed way throughout the game," so Bjorn commented on his choice of the players at the individual games.
The introduction of the new German warship was re-energized
The most recent German Navy frigate was to be put in place as early as 2014 instead of old-fashioned battleships in the Cold War, but, according to the local media, this will not happen until at least the following year, due to an upheaval of systems and a rapid increase in spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which was obtained from a spokesman for the military, the entry into operation of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of a series of modern frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that had arisen after the shipment had affected the implementation of the ambit project.
The four ships of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old "Bremen" class frigate.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some of the technologies for lowering visibility, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is the long period of technical security, and it is expected that new frigates will be able to stay away from the base port for about two years.
Journalists Die Seet warns, however, that due to the constant delays of the modern-day warships, which were to increase the military power of Germany in the sea, will also become obsolete at the time of their introduction.
A multi-family F125 frigate was hit in the headlines of the Toric newspaper when the German Navy officially refused to bring the ship into operation and returned it to the Blowm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a warship was returned to a ship-building company after delivery.
The reasons for the return are little known, but the German media referred to significant “software and hardware deficiencies” that made the warship unfit for military operations.
Shortcomings of the software are particularly important, as the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class is made up of about 120 sailors, which is only half the number of men who served in the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the vessel has a significant margin of weight, which has worsened its exploitative properties and limited the possibilities for further modernization.
It is believed that the Rainland-Palatinate frigate is twice as heavy (7000 tons) for the same class ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to poor equipment, the total cost of the project was another problem, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euro has become a huge 3.1 billion euro (US$ 3.6 billion).
The problems of getting new frigates have gained special weight in the light of recent warnings about the fall of the German Navy.
At the beginning of the year, the Guns-Peter Bartels Armed Forces Bundestag reported that the Navy of the country “was left with a small number of ships suitable for combat missions”.
The official claimed that the situation had deteriorated for some time, since the old ships had been out of use and the new ones had not arrived.
He expressed deep regret that none of the Frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to fill the Navy.
A national trust will observe the secret life of bats
A new study that is being carried out in the land area in the Scots Hills is intended to determine how bats use the landscape to search for food.
Scientists hope that the data will help to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take future steps to keep them.
In the gardens of Invery in Wester Ross, scientists of the Scottish National Trust will observe species such as neopier dwarfs and pygmies, as well as the ears of the common and watery night.
Special enumerators will be located in strategic locations in the land area to observe the behaviour of the bats during the season.
Workers and volunteers of the Scottish National Trust will also conduct mobile studies using hand-detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and fitness of bat screams.
Then it's planned to develop a detailed map of the animal's life and to prepare a report to link the animal's behavior to the environment of the animal's life.
Rob Deward, a resource person for the protection of nature in the National Spending of Scotland, hopes that the results of the study will help to determine which areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of measures to care for the environment (e.g. the formation of grasslands) and to determine how best to conserve forests for bats and other associated species.
During the last century, the bat population declined significantly in Scotland and in the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by the active construction and development of areas that deprive them of their place of nesting.
Other negative factors include wind - and - lighting, adhesive fly paper, chemical processing of building materials, and home-cat attacks.
The vocabulary is not in fact blind.
However, after hunting at night, their ears are more effective in catching prey than their eyes.
They use complex sonar techniques to detect insects and hindrances on the flight trajectory.
In the National Spending of Scotland, which covers over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance, and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, bats are taken very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts conduct regular studies, check -ups, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts even created the first and only Fleet Reservoir in Scotland, which is located in the area of Trev in the area of Dumfriss & Galloway, where eight out of ten species of bats live in Scotland.
David Thompson, the manager, says it's the perfect place for them.
"In the area of the Premises, there are wonderful conditions for the bats," he assures us.
"There are old buildings, a lot of huge trees, and other favorable living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot about bats, and through the studies we do here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to flourish."
It insists that it is very important to test the area for the presence of bats before any technical work is carried out, since the unintentional destruction of one nest to produce a young man can kill up to 400 females with children, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
Scavengers and their nests are protected by law, and animals are not allowed to kill, torturing or torturing.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Fleet Conservation Center, urged the public to join the organization.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, we still haven't revealed the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects the charge of rape, and his lawyers prepare a complaint against the German edition
Cristian Ronald called the charges of rape a "fucking-up" and claimed that people "were trying to draw attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a complaint against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, in which information about suspicions was published.
The American Catrin Majorga accused the forward of the Portuguese Congregation and the Juventus football club of raping in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the magazine Der Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid $375,000 to keep her quiet.
A few hours after the 33-year-old Ronald was charged, he turned to 142 million of his fans in the Instagram video tour, calling the respective messages a "smart."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander,” a statement was made to the camera by the Golden Ball's five-time ruler.
"They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to profit from me, but similar situations are part of my job.
I'm a happy man and I'm okay," added the football player, smiling.
According to Reuters' information agency, Ronald's lawyers are preparing a suit against Der Spiegel for the published charges, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspicion in private life."
The lawyer, Christian Shertz, claimed that a footballer would claim compensation for “the moral harm in size, which is consistent with the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most common cases of individual rights violations in recent years”.
The incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronald fell on his knees and said he was a 99 percent good guy, who was a one percent bad guy.
As stated in the records, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but in agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to a court-martial order, because she was "afraid of avenging" and guarded against "public humiliation."
Now, a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous deal, because she's still suffering from an incident that she said had taken place.
At the time of the incident, Ronald was preparing to move to the FC Real Madrid with the FC Manchester United, and this summer he became a major player in Italian football, the Juventus team, for 100 million euro.
Brexit: Britain will “everlastingly harm” the loss of automotive workers
The UK will "long-lastingly harm" if it loses the status of world leader in automobile industry after Brexit, and this is warned by the Minister of the Economy, Greg Clark.
He added that he was appalled by a statement by Toyota UK, who had told BBC journalists that in the case of British exit from the EU without a deal, the company would have to suspend the production and operation of its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," assures Secretary Clarke.
The Japanese automotive worker claimed that the effects of delays on the border in the case of Brexit without a contract could cost a job.
The Bernaston factory, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis cars, has released about 150,000 machines, 90% of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain exits the EU by the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other automotive workers, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about the impact of the British exit from the EU without an international trade deal.
For example, BMW stated that the Mini model factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main fear of automotive workers is that Brexit, without a deal, can cause risk to supply chains.
Toyota's production line functions in the fast-delivery mode of parts and materials according to the needs – details come every 37 minutes from the British and EU suppliers for the car that is being ordered.
If, on March 29, the United Kingdom left the EU out of a deal, there might be some disruption in the supply of the details, leading to delays and a lack of material.
As the company says, the Toyota store can place the details for no more than one day, so the production will have to stop.
Greg Clark pointed out that the European Union's plan for a relationship with Theresa May (Cheques Plan) “expressly provides a scheme for the avoidance of problems on the border.”
"We need a deal, and we need to make an optimal deal, which I think will not only make it possible to succeed at the moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have emerged," he said during the Today program at BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's representatives, as well as of other automotive workers, we need to keep the well-formed high-impact supply chains."
At Toyota, it was not possible to tell you how long the industry will be shut down, but in the long run, it is expected that the cost increases will lead to a loss in the company's competitiveness and, as a result, to contract jobs.
Peter Tsavaris, head of the United Trade Union in the Bernaston Factory, who worked here for 24 years, said that the other participants were very concerned, "I can tell from experience that shortened jobs do not resume."
A government representative said, "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan to shape our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting can be postponed again, in the White House
According to White House representatives on Sunday, the responsible meeting of Donald Trump with the Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "relay for a week" while the debate is ongoing over the nomination of Brett Cavanaugh as a judge of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Müller, who investigates Russia's interference in the election, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For a few months in Washington, D.C., there is a discussion of the possibility of the release of the attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about the use of microphones to record talks with Trump and the possibility of the 25th Amendment ending the president's powers.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday, he visited the White House on the background of reports that the official was about to retire.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump claimed that "wouldn't want to" release Rosenstein, but the meeting was then set aside to avoid a time-long match with the session of the Juridical Committee of the Senate, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blazey Ford, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh, which added to the vote in the Senate.
Pressecretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, performed on Fox News Sunday.
To a question about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not set, it may be this week, and I expect it to be set aside for another week, in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I keep keeping the press up to date."
Some reporters disagreed: Sanders did not hold a briefing for the media in the White House since September 10.
The speaker Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the infrequent conduct of the Brifings was not related to the "playing for the public" by TV reporters, even though she said, "I won't deny that they're playing for the public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would be more involved with the press.
"The president answers the questions more often than any president to him," she said, and added, without referring to the source, "Statistics speaks for itself."
Sanders pointed out that the brigs are still going to take place, but "if the press is able to ask the President of the United States a question, it's better than talking to me."
We're trying to talk to the press a lot, and this should have been particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the ability to talk to the president of the United States is no worse than the press conference."
Trump regularly responds to questions on the way out of the White House, open-ended meetings, or press conferences for the participation of high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why this is so by speaking in front of the reporters in a bit of a bit of a wonder.
The State Secretary for Health in Scotland wrote to the EU employees for fear of Brexit
The State Secretary for Health has sent a letter to citizens of other EU countries working in the National Health Service of Scotland to express their gratitude for their work and to ask them to continue after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, had sent a letter less than six months before the British exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already assumed the obligation to defray the cost of an application for permanent resettlement status for EU citizens who work in the autonomous state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said, "For the last summer, there was a conversation between the United Kingdom and the EU on the question of a way out.
But the British government is intensifying preparations for a possible exit without a treaty.
I know this period can be very disturbing for you.
That's why I'd like to stress again how much I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
All of the European Union and countries outside the European Union share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving health services for the benefit of the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, we really want you to stay."
Christian Ebercrombie Transformed Terminal Surgery After Head Injury
The semi-backer of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Ebercrombie, transpired after having suffered a head injury in the Sunday match against the Vanderbilt Comodores, who his team lost with account 31:27. This was reported by a journalist at Tennessee.
The head coach at Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player had been injured just before the break.
"He went to the side line, where he got angry," Rid said.
On the sideline, the coaches and medical staff gave Ebercrombie the oxygen before taking it back on their shoulders for further testing.
An official of the Tennessee State Tigers team told Chris Harris from WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie had operated at the University of Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "until there is no evidence of the type and severity of the injury." In the Tennessee State Tigers team, they're trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-year student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after moving from the Illinois team.
He did five pick-ups of the ball on Sunday before getting out of the game, so in the season he's got 18 pick-ups.
Foreign buyers will pay more tomatoes in the case of the UK’s immobility
Foreign buyers will pay more tomatoes in the event of the loss of movement in the United Kingdom. In line with Tory's new plans, extra money will be spent to help the homeless.
This set neutralizes all Corbin's attempts to involve young voters
The higher state tax will be drawn from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
In the Department of Finance, an extra £120 million a year is expected to be used to help the homeless
As Teresa May, a foreigner who buys non-moving in the United Kingdom today, will pay more tomatoes, and extra money will be spent to help the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremiah Corbin’s efforts to involve young voters in promises of more affordable housing for highly paid workers.
An increase in the amount of money is due to natural and legal persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the government's extra money is directed to help those who have to sleep in the open sky.
An extra towel, which is accompanied by an upturn in the ancestral age to a second dwelling and a fixed rent, may be three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, an additional 120 million pounds per year is expected.
In London, 13% of the new immobility is estimated to be in the possession of foreign citizens, which increases the price and complicates the task for those who just dream about their own dwelling.
Many rich parts of the country, particularly in the capital, are deserted, as a large number of foreign buyers live most of the time outside the country.
The new plan of action came in just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lowering of the State to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused big construction companies of maintaining high prices for immobility by buying land without further use of it, and he urged Theresa May to give up the quota for available immobility to correct the "smart position on the housing market" in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbin has announced a number of important reforms in the area of immobility, such as rent control and the impossibility of evasion without good reason.
He also offers to expand the authority of the local council in the area of new housing.
Theresa May said, "I promised that I would dedicate my privilege to the restoration of the British dream - for every new generation of life should be a better one.
This requires a change in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always remain open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own dwelling has become unattainable, and the problem of living in the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "More than anything, I want to be the head coach of the Scots Congregation."
The head coach of the FC Sanderland, Jack Ross, claims that "the most he wants" is to take the lead in Scotland.
A 42-year-old Scotsman went to rebuild the club from the northeast of the country, which is now ranked third in the First Football League, three points away from the leader.
Ross moved to Stadium of Light this summer, returning the last season of the FC "St. Mirren" to the Prime Ligue of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to the second collection in Scotland, but that's all over,” Ross told me on the SportsOUND program at the BBC Scotland radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I used to watch the game of the Scots collective at Hampden Park Stadium." It always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to be successful as the head coach of the club."
Ross' predecessors to the FC Sanderland included Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy King, Gustavo Poetus, and Paolo DiCanio.
Former head coach of the FC "Hello Athletique" claims that he didn't feel agitated about moving to a big club following such authoritative names, rejecting the offers from the FC "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"At the current stage, I'll think I've made a success if the club returns to the Prime League.
Thanks to its structure and material and technical security, the club is no doubt the same as the Prime League,” he said.
"It's not going to be an easy task, but the other result I don't think is going to be a success."
Ross has been a coach for three years, and he's been the second coach at the FC Dumbarton, and he's spent 15 months at the FC coaching headquarters at the Garths.
And then he helped "Hello" out after the FC got to the third division, and the next season from "St. Merren" went from the run-off to the title of the first division.
According to Ross, he's now more comfortable than ever during his FC game career at Clyde, Gartlpool, Folkick, St. Merren, and Hamilton Academy.
"I'm at a crossroads," he mentions, talking about moving to the FC "Hello."
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more appropriate to me than to play.
That sounds strange, because I've been a success, I've been a good earner, and I've reached some heights.
But it's not easy to play.
There are many challenges that we have to deal with each week.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as the head coach, I feel right in my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt more comfortable in my adult life than since I chose this profession."

Study: 5:30 a.m. Sunday is the perfect time for the beer kitchen
The summer heat has helped to increase the value of British pubs, which are not in the best of times, but have increased the pressure on the restaurant network.
In July, sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7%, while the profit of restaurants declined by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA, who advises on business development, said, "Because of the sun's weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup, July went over the same pattern as the previous month, when the profit rose by 2.8 per cent, and restaurants went even worse.
The red drop by 1.8% in July increased.
Pubs and bars focused on the supply of drinks so far have the best scores: the increase in their profits is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
Pubs that serve food have also been affected by the heat, but not as much as restaurants.
Visitors seem to be interested in drinks.
In controlled pubs and bars, the sales of drinks in a month have increased by 6.6%, and the sales of food have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, analyst at the Free and Hotel Department of RSM, said, "We've seen similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sporting events continue to be major factors that affect sales on the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, groups of restaurants continue to lose profit. An annual sales drop of 4.8 per cent causes special concern over the need to cut costs.
A long hot summer didn't come at the best time for the restaurants to feed, and let's see if the milder temperature we've seen in August can give them the necessary rest."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, in July has been 2,7 per cent, reflecting the slowing down of new brands.
A galouse indicator of the volume of sales of the Computer Peach Tracker in the British pubs, bars and restaurants is a reflection of the collected and analysed performance of 47 working groups, which have a total of over 9 billion pounds sterling. This is a generally accepted industry standard.
One out of every five children has a social media account hidden from their parents.
According to the results of the study, 1 out of 5 children, sometimes under 11 years of age, have an account hidden from their parents and teachers on social media.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictional pages in Instagram
This news has increased concern about possible sexual content
20 percent of the students said they had a "core account" that was shown to their parents.
One out of every five children, sometimes under 11 years of age, creates a social media account that hides from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictional pages in Instagram, a social network for the exchange of photos.
This news has increased the concern about the possible placement of a sexual content.
20 per cent of the students reported having a clean “primary” account that is shown to their parents, as well as one or more private students.
The mother, who accidentally hit the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a call for "rape me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two social media profiles. Half of these children admitted that an additional account was secret.
The head of the HMC Association, Mike Buchanan, said, "We are very concerned about the fact that a lot of teenagers feel the need to create an online space where parents and teachers will not be able to find them."
Elide Doyle will become "athlet interests" in Scotty Athletics
Elide Doyle was elected to the Scotty Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general board of board members.
The head of the board, Yen Beatty, called this a great opportunity for those who lead the sporting movement to take advantage of the wide-ranging experience gained at the international level over the last decade.
"Eylid enjoys immense respect among Scotland, the United Kingdom, and the world, and we are convinced that, by joining the board, the athletic sport in Scotland will be of great benefit," Beatty's assurance.
Doyle said, "Inspired to represent the interests of the athletes, I hope I can really benefit and promote the development of sport in Scotland."
The American, a four-time Olympic champion who won 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta games, and now a BBC sporting tour, lost the opportunity to go through a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote to Twitter, "That's when I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that the time alone would show me whether or not I would be able to recover.
As a result of my incredible efforts, I have been able to recover fully, and I have learned to walk again, and I am doing dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for the words of support!"
In advertising, the milk-sucker of women was compared to cows – Internet users' thoughts split up
The milk-sucking producer had a mixed reaction of Internet users to an ad that compared young mothers to active cows.
To mark the release of a product called the world's first quiet milk-sucker, Elvie's consumer technology company published an ad in a humorist music video style to show the freedom that a new sucker provides to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cinnamon under a song that says, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail," and "If you see it, it's not a spell, it's my breasts."
Then the choir sings, "Suck it up, suck it up to feed the children, suck it off, suck it off to keep the milk from wasting."
However, the advert, published on the Facebook page of the company, led to a turbulent discussion online.
The video has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the reaction of the Internet users has been mixed, and many have noted that the ads underestimate the “horrible organization” of the production of milk in the industry.
"It's not a very smart decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and have a baby to give milk, but their kids are being taken away from them a few days after they're born,” wrote one of the users.
Elvie's milk-sucker can easily be hidden in a feeding bra (Elvie/Moother)
Here's another comment: "It's clear that it's traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not involve them in advertising a milk-sucker for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone added, "These ads are far from real."
Other users have taken the stand to protect the ad, and one of the women in the video was "so much fun."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would certainly have bought something like that if I was still breastfing.
Sucking the milk, I really felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I didn't look for any hidden content in it.
It's a wonderful product," wrote someone.
Here's another comment: "A funny ad for mommys who suck milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This ad is not meant to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women display milk-suckers hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, the Elvie suction works completely quietly, has no wires or tubes, and easily hides in a breast-feeding bra, so that women can move freely, keep their children, and even go out.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive director of the Mather Advertising Agency, commented on this situation: "The Elvie Sucker is so revolutionary that it requires a bright and provocative presentation.
After sharing a parallel between women who cure milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the specialities of breast-feeding, in an exciting and interesting way, showing the incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker would bring.
The Elvie Sucker is not the first time in the news headers.
As part of the Fashion Week in London, the mother of the two children showed up at the event with the product while displaying clothing from the modeler Martha Yakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively constant, in part because strict rhetoric and policy by the Trump administration has made it more difficult to place children in caretakers.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers were the immigrants themselves who did not have the documents, and now they are afraid to put their own chance of staying in the country by offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential caretakers and other adult members of their homes would be required to print their fingerprints and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albins, a senior member of the Bureau of Immigration and Control, testified to the Congress that the Bureau's co-workers had arrested dozens of people who had applied to care for minors without escort.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Around 80 percent of the people who are caretakers or members of their homes are illegal in the country, many of whom are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we continue to persecute these people,” said Mr. Albins.
According to the shelter staff, in order to deal with children's cases more quickly, the officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month after being held, not 60 days later, as they used to be.
Many of them will be able to use video-conferencing instead of coming to court in person to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to receive shelter by court decision will be deported quickly.
According to the staff of the shelter and the official data from the responsible officials in the last months, the longer the children are under guard, the more likely it is that they will feel alarmed or depressed, and this can lead to outbreaks of violence or escape.
Lawyers claim that these problems are increasing in larger establishments, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological state of children.
They added that by moving the children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends, we risk exacerbating the trauma that many of them have suffered.
Syria ordered the US, France, and Turkey to immediately withdraw their forces.
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country had been in war for eight years.
Moualem, who also works as a vice-president of the Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces had been on Syrian soil illegally under the influence of the fight against terrorism, so "the attitude to them will be appropriate."
"They have to go immediately and not make a deal," he said at the assembly.
Mu'alem insisted that "war on terrorism is in fact over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He claimed that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has stationed some 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mostly teaching and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war-torn country, France sent over 1,000 soldiers.
As for the refugees, Mu'alem assured us that the country had created the right conditions for their return, and he also accused the "some Western countries" of "proliferating unsubstantiated fears" that prevented the refugees from coming back.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to help people return," he said.
"We are witnessing an attempt to politicize a humanitarian problem."
The US and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to rebuild the country until a political agreement is made between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The United Nations Diplomats will report that the recent treaty between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlibu, the last big rebel cover, has made it possible to continue the political talks.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish agreement, it was possible to prevent a large-scale offensive by Syrian forces backed by Russia to a province of three million people.
However, Mu'alem stressed that the deal had “smart terms” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the Al-Qaida-related al-Nusr Front, who “will be destroyed”.
UN-Embassador Staffan de Mistura looks forward to convening the first meeting of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and to create conditions for elections.
Mu'alem made arrangements for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, claiming that his work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and cautioned against intervention.
Why the Trump will be reconfigured
According to this logic, Trump can be reconfigured in 2020, if, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, it does not make up the authority long after scandal and impeachment.
No doubt it would have been the most dramatic completion of the presidency in all time!
At the current moment, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (to 1.05 million) on CNN and has actually tripled (to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Madow Show on the MSNBC cable channel had reached the top of a rating of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when major news was discussed.
"This is the fire that attracts people, because it is beyond our comprehension," said Nil Bere, the producer of the Last Candidate drama on ABC's channel about the Secretary of State, who becomes president after the fatal attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced Goumorist writer and author of the book "Better Funny Moments: As well as a few hard truths about infiltrating the Hollywood men's club," offers a different theory.
She remembered a trip to the Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's laughing at me," he said.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington history can determine the future of Rowe's case against Wade, the possibility of reuniting immigrant families, and the state of the world economy.
Avoiding is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it can't be said that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you watch a group of experts talk about Bob Woodward's use of "good-known" sources for his book "The Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 strut skin jacket, and the effects of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy, published by Storm Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the former.
"The reality of the show is in part linked to the fact that you are conspiring to do something new every night," noted Brent Montgomery, the principal executive director of Weelhouse Entertainment, and the author of a TV program called "The Stars of the Pawnshop", about rotating in an actor's pool, and about daily plotting in the show "Trump" (a conflict with the NFL, supported by Kim Chen In).
If you let yourself overlook one episode, you can be hopelessly left behind.
When I met Mr. Fleis this week at his home on the north coast of Kauai Island, the warm sun was standing (27 degrees Celsius), but he was at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get rid of the TV, not when Brett Cavanaugh put himself in front of the Senate Juridical Committee, but the future of the Supreme Court hung up in the hair.
"I remember when we used to create all those crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flyce told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it looks like they were right."

External Infusions of the Hardest Intermediate Elections in the Congres
It's no wonder that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, extra money is being injected, because, by looking at the boundaries of the electoral districts, the two right congressmen are running for one chair.
A Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lemb, who won a victory in another district in the extra elections of last spring, is taking part in the struggle for this parish of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed.
Lemb stands up to another valid congressman, the Republican of Kit Roths, who is now representing the old 12th district of the state of Pennsylvania, whose borders are very much the same as the new 17th.
The maps were reworked after the Pennsilvania Supreme Court in January passed a decision that the old limits of the districts had been framed for the benefit of the Republicans, contrary to the Constitution.
The pre-elective race in the new 17th district led to strong opposition between the financial subdivisions of the main parties, the US Democratic Party Committee for Congress Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (RCC).
The name Lemba became very well-known in Pennsylvania, after a win with a minimal advantage in the 18th district, in the margins of the congressional elections in March, which were widely publicized.
This place belonged to the Republic for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point victory in this district.
Political experts have given little preference to Democrats.
In the U.S., the possibility of reprimanding El Salvador for support of China was considered, but changed its mind
Diplomats reminded of Washington’s weak opposition to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump had a warm meeting with President Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and Trump had also had a hotel in Panama, until his partners removed the staff hired by Trump Organization.
Officials of the State Department decided to recall the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of “the recent decision on Taiwan's non-removal”, said the Spokesman of the Department of Gezer Neuert earlier this month.
But it was only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid in 2017, particularly in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included the shortening of financial aid and the target limits on the issuance of a visa, would be painful for this country of Central America, with its high levels of unemployment and murder.
According to the results of the internal council of the North and Central American states, the conference was held at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, and last year's analytic West was seen as a step forward in efforts to control the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by the middle of September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence is now planning to speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October to indicate that the administration considers this to be a very important event.
At that time, three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there were no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's representative at the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that had been reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, on anonymous terms.
The information they provided was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on anonymous terms.
Learn History
The next discontent is a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Müller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which is a strong confirmation of what can be found in the public information that is now available.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is said to test the possible link between Trump's campaign and the attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence in the Congree takes place in other hands, Trump will have to report to the congressmen, just as he will to the polls and, eventually, to the same party.
There's a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't want to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as are his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will determine the duration of the fight.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to set up a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had begun to oppose it and had backed the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to escape blood.
The course of history is defined by such moments, and the uncontrollable movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a number of such moments.
What are we going to do if Trump fires A.D.A. Rod Rosenstein, a man who depends on Mr. Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein was in a mess when the newspaper had information that he had offered to secretly record conversations with the president and shared his thoughts on the problem of the Trump's incompatibilities in office.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
"How will we react if the investigation of the case against Britt Cavanaugh, which recently started the FBI, is not sufficiently thorough or fair enough, or if Cavanaugh's candidacy to the Supreme Court is confirmed, despite strong accusations of sexual harassment and false witnessing?
And, first of all, will we, in the medium term, vote for those members of the Congress who will be able to hold Trump responsible?
If we fail this test, it will be a bad time for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-speaking Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light up the Saturday candles on the swastika table.
With such an inheritance, can I not look forward to the future with optimism?"

Grem Dorrans from Rangers is optimizing to meet the Vienna Rapid.
The FC Rangers accepts the Rapid on Thursday, after an astonishing fact in Spain in a game with the Villarreal at the beginning of this month's victory over the Austrians, the Scottish Club will offer a good chance of getting out of Group G of the European League.
As a result of the injury, the semi-defendant Graham Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a match with the Villarreal, which ended with a score of 2:2, but he believes that the FC Rangers can use it as a swing to do more.
"This was a good result for us, because "Villarreal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with the hope of getting something and got one point.
Perhaps at the end of the match we could go forward, but nothing in general can probably be considered a fair result.
In the first half, the opponent was the best, but after the break, we fixed the situation for our benefit.
On Thursday, there will be another important opposition in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it won't be easy, and our future rivals have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on the support of the batterers, and I'm sure we can get a good result.
Last year was, of course, hard, starting with my injuries and ending up with the changes in the club itself, but now the situation is normal.
We have a great setup, and all the guys are content.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind, and make it a success."
A woman’s sleep is lost because of the fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few spoke to the members of their family about it.
About half of the people who had been involved in the Nationwide study said that they had talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of the interviewees talked to the kids about it.
"People want to be taken care of by a member of the family, but they don't rush to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide subdivision on life insurance.
That's how you start.
Talk to your husband or wife and your children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need if you don't tell your family your wishes in advance.
Consult with your counselor and your family to find out where and how to get care, because this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Get a financial consultant to advise on how to cover the costs involved.
The sources of long - term care include the traditional insurance policy, the hybrid life - insurance policy, or self - support at the expense of your own money (as long as you have money).
Carefully prepare the legal documents, which will help to avoid legal tracts in advance.
Prepare trust for your representative, who will control your health care and make sure that experts do what you want if you cannot do it personally.
In addition, we recommend that trust in the management of money be formalized.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills if you are not able to do so.
Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs urgent medical attention, so he is taken to the hospital.

The victim did not see the assailant.
His wounds do not pose a threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunamis in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, report to the public authorities, but the number of casualties may increase.
As a result of the break-up of the system of communications, officials involved in the provision of humanitarian assistance are unable to obtain any information from the Regentship of Dongal, an area north of Pale, which is nearing the epicentre of the magnetic earthquake of 7.5 points.
After a natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Pale.
Let us give some basic facts about the city of Palau and the Regentship of the Dongal Island of Sulavesi.
The Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800, according to the data for 2017.
When the tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th birthday.
Dongala is a Regent that stretches over 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the data for 2017, there are some 299,200 people living in the administrative region, located in the lower part of the province.
Fishing and farming are the main economics of Central Sulawesi, especially the Dongal coast.
Nickel production is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in the Seaval, on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian agency for the mitigation of the effects of natural disasters in the past 100 years, Palau and Dongala have suffered from tsunamis several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people died as a result of tsunamis in Dongal and hundreds of houses were destroyed.
In 1996 the tsunami also covered the west part of the Dongala, and then nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismic Pacific fire ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Below are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, located in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: At the end of March, early in April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 points hit the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: In the vicinity of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra, a magnetic earthquake of 7.6 points.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 points struck one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: a weak earthquake struck the Regentship of Godjai in the province of Aceg, causing destruction and panic due to the fact that humans had not yet forgotten the devastating earthquake and the tsunamis of 2004.
This time, there were no tsunamis, but over 100 people lost their lives under the rubble of the building.
2018: Major earthquakes struck Lombok Island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless houses, and thousands of tourists were unable to leave the island immediately.
Sarah Palin, the oldest son, was arrested for domestic violence
The track of Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the vice president's candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for the charge of attack.
According to a report published on Saturday by the state of Alaska, 29-year-old Palin of Wasilly, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing a report of violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman I know tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is on guard in the Matanusca-City Explorer with a 500-dollar bill.
He went to court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when he was asked if he confessed his guilt, and was reported online.
Palina is charged with three offences in class A, which presuppose a one - year arrest and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with class B misconduct, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as with obstructing the report of domestic violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol abuse when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for justifying her son’s brutal behavior by posttraumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, the earthquake caused the tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on Sulawes Island of Indonesia on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 gallons caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The telecommunications and power grids have come out of line, and the number of victims can increase in the nearest days.
The earthquake took place near the center of Sulawesi Island, located in the northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The video, which is spreading in social media, shows the moment when nature hits.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami landed on the shore.
Federal accusers demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York
In New York City, federal accusers demand the death penalty of Syfullo Saïp, a suspected terrorist in New York City, which resulted in the death of eight people – a rare penalty that has not been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
In October, the 30-year-old Saïves was said to have taken a bicycle track at Home Depot Picape in the West Side, Lower Manhattan, and had begun to beat the cyclists and pedestrians he had encountered on the road.
In line with the report of the intention to get executed in the south of the state of New York to justify the death penalty, the indictees must prove that the Saïves "wrongly" killed eight people and "deliberately" caused serious bodily harm.
According to the judicial records, each of these counts of the charge foresees the possibility of capital punishment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Jury Court charged Saïp with 22 counts, including eight charges of murder for the purpose of demanding that the federal accusers usually press charges for organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the accusers who described the Saïp crime as "wretched, brutal, and malicious," this attack is the result of "genuine planning and a predetermined mind."
The victims to whom Syfulla Habibullayevich Saipov caused injury, harm or murder were Diego Enrice Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lauret, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferrouche, Ernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnecco, as described in the message of intent.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last criminal case in the south of New York City, which is punishable by death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers, and was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the federal death penalty was carried out in New York in 1953, the couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after being convicted of a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were shot dead on the electric table on June 19, 1953.
According to the judicial records of Saïp, a native of Uzbekistan did not show any remorse the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said to the detectives that he was not sorry for what he had done.
According to an incriminating act by the Saïves, he told the authorities that he had been inspired to carry out an attack on the video IDIL that he was looking at on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang the IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represented Saipova, said that they were "extremely disappointed" by this decision of the procurator.
"We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty, instead of admitting guilt and imposing life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only add to the mental trauma that these events have caused to all the victims," said Patton.
The Saipov side had also previously asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
Parliamentarian from the Conservative Party believes that NYJEL FARAJA should be assigned to the negotiators of Brexit
Today, during the protest at the Conservative Party, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the national army."
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party stated that the politicians should “hear the pressure” of the Europeans, as one of the members of the Parliament of Theresa May had proposed his candidacy for talks with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bone, said at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have come out" if Mr. Faraj was the secretary of Brexit.
The fact that members of the Conservative Party, who are opposing the exit, have joined a special protest in the city against Brexit, has drawn attention to the problems that May was facing in an effort to reconcile her deep-separated ranks.
The Prime Minister is trying to implement the compromising plan of the Chequers despite the attacks by Brexit, the opponents of the exit, and the EU.
The allies insist that it will not stop trying to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force Europeans and laborers to choose between what it offers and "chaos."
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solikhal, Mr. Bone said he wanted to "remove the Chequers."
He suggested that Mr. Faraj step out of the shadows and take responsibility for the talks with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out," he said.
Parliamentarian Wellingborough added, "I will support Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers."
Addressing the EU, he said, "We did not fight in world wars to subjugate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that, after the vote in 2016, public opinion had changed: "The idea that the British had changed their mind and did not want to come out is completely untrue."
A member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit, Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to reporters, "I'm just saying, "Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not backed up by our party and by our activists, who are actually walking on the streets and fighting for the votes of the electors.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In her address to Theresa May, she added, "The Prime Minister keeps his office when he fulfills his promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians should “recognize pressure” if they were to give up the decision taken in the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them it won't get away with."
In a report to a passionate crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, who is planning to betray the Brexit idea, to feel under pressure.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country, which will lead us to the victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-conscious, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the opponents of the exit passed by Birmingham, and then held a two - hour rally in the center of the city.
A number of activists waved "Conservatives vs. Brexit" when the group was started with these releases.
The Labour Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives because security problems had arisen since the opening of the conference through their party program.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "think seriously" about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Vorren said that after her November election, she would "think seriously about running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the Western Massachusetts General Assembly, a representative of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running in November for a second term against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Diel, who was the co-head of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is viewed as the main candidate that can fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, her 36th meeting with the general assembly polls was held since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to take part in the presidential election.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up the government, and for that to happen, there's got to be a woman in the head."
Arrested a suspect in murder with a firearm from a basketball player, LSU Tigers, Sims
In Baton-Rage, Louisiana, on Saturday, a suspect was arrested on Friday by the LS-Tigers basketball player, Wade Sims, who was suspected of murder.
The Baton-Rage Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in the east.
On Friday, they published a video of a shooter with a request to help recognize the person on it.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot at Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Vade Simms was shot in the head, and as a result he was killed," he said to the 247sports on Saturday, the Chief of Police, Murphy J. Paul.
Wade stood up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
The interview revealed that Simpson was at the scene of the crime, that he had a gun with him, and that he had shot at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Police Department.
Simms, which was six feet and six inches tall and played in the Junior League, grew up in Baton-Rose, and played 32 games with 10 stars last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes in the field, 5.6 points, and 2.9 picks.
Grand First Russia: Lewis Hamilton shortened the race for the world championship after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the time that Walthery Bottas left Lewis Gemilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from a poul-posting and had almost beat Hamilton, who was trying to hold his position at the first two corners, and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to the Pit-stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of the race, which was about to solve it.
The pilot of the Mercedes team drove another circle and went out behind Fettel, but Hamilton broke out of the lead after a certain wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre, as a result of which the driver Ferrari reluctantly left the inner space because of the risk that it would be squeezed after the double manoeuvre had led him forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstoppen started from the back row of the net and remained in seventh place until the end of the first round.
Then he led most of the race, because he didn't change the tires to get to the finish and get Kimy Rykkonen out of the fourth place.
In sum, he stopped at the plaque on the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the pace at the last eight, so Rykkonen sat down fourth.
"It's a hard day, 'cause Walderry was full on all weekends, and he was nostalgic when he gave me the opportunity to pass.
The team did an exceptional job to be seated first and second,' said Hamilton.
The language of the body was not astounding
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein for her firm position that she had not revealed the content of a letter from Christine Blazey Ford, who was blaming a candidate in the Supreme Court of Britta Cavanaugh for sexual violence.
During his speech at the West Virginia rally, the president did not direct the presentation given by Ford to the Senate Juridical Committee, but instead expressed his view of the events in the Senate, which, he said, demonstrated human “subordination, impropriety and lying.”
"The only thing that could have happened, and all the wonderful thing that's been happening in the Senate for the last few days, is anger, you see the evil people displaying vileness, abomination, and a lie," he said.
"You're looking at the publications and the information they've given, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you give the information?
Recall her answer... did you disclose the contents of the documents? - “What?
Oh, no.
I didn't tell you."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing the charges against Cavanaugh, and in early September, his content was publicized, but Feinstein denied that the information was leaked to her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charge, I didn't disclose the information I got from her," said the Financial Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn't break my promise."
However, her denial seemed to dislike the president, who commented at the Saturday's meeting, "I'll tell you, her body language was not astonished at all.
She may not have done it, but I haven't seen anyone hold on to it."
Continuing to defend a candidate to the Supreme Court, who was charged with sexual violence by three women, the president assumed that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power in any way necessary.
You see abhorrentness, abhorrentness, they don't care who they're offended, who they need to go through to get power and control,” Mediaite quotes the president's words.
Elite League: Dundy Stars -- Belfast Jayants, 5:3
"Jayants" player Patrick Dwyer threw out two pucks in a match against "Dunde."
"Dundy Stars" rehabed for a Friday break in the elite league from the Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 match and report on Saturday.
"Jayants" won an early two-peak advantage thanks to Patrick Dwyer's and Francis Boville's rolls.
Mike Sallivan and Jordan Coney levelled the score in the home match, and then Dwyer redirected the Jaiants.
"Dandy" player, François Bouchard, levelled the score, and two of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's scores secured their victory.
This is the third time in the Elite League season to defeat the team of Adam Keef, who won a free victory over Dundee with a score of 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season.
Dwyer left the first puck for the fourth minute (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall McFall, and four minutes later, Boville, who got the puck from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period of 14 minutes (13:10), Sallivan returned the landlords to the game, and at 16 minutes (15:16), Coney, after receiving a puck from Matt Markwardt, levelled the score.
Dwyer had the advantage of "Jayants" before the first break, throwing his second puck at the end of the first period.
The landlords regrouped, and Bouchard rebalancing the score for the 28th minute (27:37) by putting a puck out when his team numbered it.
Thanks to the efforts of Coney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen, at the end of the second period, for the first time led Dundee forward and secured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Jayants team, which has already lost four of the last five games, will play a race against Milton-Kines.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could escape an earthquake
The flight controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he had helped to fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his life.
More than 800 people lost their lives and lost a lot of news after a severe earthquake that caused the tsunamis on the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Strong suburbs continue to shake the area, and many people are trapped in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues who had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agun refused to leave his post in the control tower, which was very divisive, at the airport of Mutiar SIS Al-Jufry in Palau.
He stayed on the ground to make sure that flight 6321 of the Batik Air, who was on the landing line at the time, was safely up in the air.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought it was going down.
He later died in the hospital.
Johns Syrite, a representative of the Indonesian Airlines Provider Company, said that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter from Blikpapan to Kalimantan, who is to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of casualties can be as high as thousands, as the agency for mitigating the effects of the country's natural disasters claims that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims can go up, because many of the bodies are still under the rubble, and many of them cannot be reached," said a representative of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves up to six feet [6 m] have devastated the city of Palau, where mass graves will be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes deliver aid and food.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mom, said to Sky News, "Every moment, quick help brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets are everywhere mugged."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helmand, said to CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help the people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they're gonna find.
It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Vitodo, arrived in Pale on Sunday and called the country's military officers, "I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the evac-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Early this year, Indonesia was affected by earthquakes on the island of Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: as Air Niugini claimed, after the crash of the plane in the lagoon one man vanished
The airline that was on a flight crashing in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one person disappeared, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crews were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated that it was not possible to find a single passenger on the day of the Sabbath.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a husband and are working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to do so.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane fell on the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers had stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The U.S. Airlines and Air Force said the plane landed in a lagoon near the landing lane.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has flown the landing lane.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was very low above the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told me that he and others managed to get to the crash exits on a thin jet by the belt in the water.
He said that the stewardess had panicked and yelled, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that seafarers working near the modernisation of the dock also helped in the rescue operation by transporting people to shore by means of an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
In the last two decades, 111 people have lost their lives in air crashes associated with PNG-registered airlines, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst restored the chronology of the night on which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution went against a man who was charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rawlett, an analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, gave testimony as an expert in the field of operational development for a few hours.
He told the jury how he used his cell phone records to replicate the movement of the 29-year-old accused Queenton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the murder.
Rollett, according to The Clary Ledger, said that he had received location data from a number of mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his earlier claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, even though he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in the city.
When the indictees asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was at the Sanford Picape that night, Sanford said that he was "because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another incompatibility was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rollett told me that some time after Chambers Tellis had died, he had removed text messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Gail said.
The defense must present its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop-bearers want to challenge a negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that the hip-hop has changed its nature – political ideas and struggles to solve social problems have gone away.
They want to go back to the outskirts and make the conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugues and the Common have recently witnessed the re-emergence of this direction in the United Kingdom, thanks to groups like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!!
In New York, the nanny filed a couple for release, getting a "racist" message.
In New York, the nanny filed a couple for discriminating release after she had received a misdirected message from her mother complaining that she was "another black."
The marriage denies that they're going to be racist, comparing the accustomed to "extortion."
Lensie Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw the new nanny, Giselle Morris, who had come to her first day of work in 2016, black.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Miss Morris twice.
According to New York Post, while she was aware of her mistake, Mrs. Plaxson-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and released Miss Morris, she said that their previous nanny, who was African-American, had been doing her job badly, and that instead she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day of work, and then sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple, hoping to get a payback for her release, which she would have received in six months to live with the couple she was first hired for, even though she had no contract. She was to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them that we don't need to do this," she said to Post on Friday and added, "I know this is discrimination."
In response to the allegation that they would become racist, the couple said that the release of Maurice was a smart decision, because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had been offended.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not gonna get rid of it," said her husband, Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with a man who was rudely treated, even if it was not intentionally?
Your baby?
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Comparing the challenge with "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had only had a baby two months ago and "not even finished."
"Would you have avenged someone after that?
It's a bad thing," added an investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has quickly convicted the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
According to the new letter, Padington’s publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear who was able to speak
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to print, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the position of the first person to read the book before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the huge success that Padington's story has made."
Telling that her father, who was a BBC operator before a small toy bear inspired him to write a child's book, was optimistic that his work had been rejected, she shared, as on the 60th anniversary of the book's release, at the same time, she felt "joy and grief," as the father had died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud of the fact that the book had become so popular.
"He was a rather modest man and didn't like to brag," she said.
"But Padington was so real to him, like his own child! 'because when the children reach something, we're proud of them, even though it's not theirs, not our victories.
I think he was looking at Padington's success in that way.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say good-bye to her phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the 2nd Louis Pasteur hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
"On a regular call, he said it was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperus.
"And then over the phone called me and said that she'd die for the next two minutes and I should say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Taschi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating gradually stopped working and left her body.
She died a while before everything was shut off.
I should have just sat there and waited, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn't stoop, scream, or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to really hold myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who had suffered from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, ignoring the severe trials that she had had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down and couldn't stop the tears.
It was hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deeply for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Gamfries leave cards on the Wallian Bridge with telephone numbers that people can call for support for, as well as messages to inspire them.
The son of Miss Davis Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he killed himself.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I do every day," she said.
The 45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in linde, told her that her son was a promising cook chef with a charming smile.
"Everyone knew him for a smile.
They always said that smile made any room lighter."
But he gave up his job before he died, because he was "many in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found the body of his brother after he had taken his own life.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid it'll have consequences."
Miss Davis made the cards, "to make people know that there are people they can contact and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't shut yourself down, you have to talk."
Miss Hamfries, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her 15 - year - old husband, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, he was depressed or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas day, he was completely desolated, and when the children opened up their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death had become a huge trauma to them, but they had to survive it, "It caused a devastating
I'm going to go to the family.
But we have to keep on living and fighting."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is on the line: the FBI is starting an investigation.
"I thought that if we could get what we asked for -- limited in time and nature of the investigation -- we might have reached some agreement," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the committee was "disrupting" in the background of the hopeless loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his lobbyists want the FBI investigating?
Their resentment is linked to time.
Intermediate elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republics are expected to have problems, it will make it very difficult for them to try to make their own choices to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush was calling the senators to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush's rule, and who made him meet his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, there will be a vote.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes at the Senate sitting, which would make it possible for Vice-President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and to accept his candidacy as a judge of the Supreme Court.
During Kim's reign, the number of North Koreans "have"
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of transients from North Korea to South Korea declined, according to the South Korean legislator.
Park Pion Seug, referring to the data of the Ministry of the United Republic of South Korea, stated that the number of crossovers in the past year was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, and that smugglers transporting illegals now required more money.
In Pyongyang, they held back from public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, it was reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views transients as illegal migrants, not refugees, and is often forced to rehearse them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still in a formal state of war, has improved markedly in the last months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issue of denuclearization, the negotiations on which had been stalled.
This occurred after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen In in Singapore, where they had agreed to work together on nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yon-Ho, in the background of the accepted sanctions, accused the US of no progress since then.
“With no confidence in the US, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no language of unilateral disarmament,” said Ri Yon-Ho in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "historical" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the post of Judge of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, “historical” and stated that he was at the same time not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've been thinking that if a woman had ever done so, she'd be called "historical," "Pelosy commented on her reaction to the Cavanaugh testimony before the Senate Juridical Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Cavanaugh's opening statement was very emotional, sometimes almost screamed and coughed up, discussing his family and school years.
He also publicly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him an “absourious and coordinated destruction of reputation,” organized by the liberals, who had been angered by the fact that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
According to Pelosi, Cavanaugh’s testimony proves that he cannot work in the Supreme Court, as it showed his bias toward the Democrats.
"I think that with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will take his own candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was offended when asked if she would try to make Cavanaugh an impeachment if his guilt was confirmed, and whether the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say, if he's not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he's not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court where he works now," said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is currently serving as a judge of the US Court of Appeal in the district of Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions against the "On Accessible Medical Care" Act or the "Roy v. Wade" case, because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of confirmation at Cavanaugh’s office, the question of whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court’s decisions was examined.
"Now is not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, preconceived person and we will say how wonderful that is," said Pelosi.
Women must possess this weapon.
These are just words that have been accumulated in months and years of anger, and she could not speak them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," said Miss Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "One woman who was somewhere working as an executive director, and she really helped me, said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had her own method, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to her fellow man, "You can think that I'm sad, and that's why I'm crying.
And I am evil."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are considered to be an acceptable way out of anger, in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my most telling memories of the first job in the office, where men worked most of the time, was that one time I was crying out of unspoken anger, and the older woman, the unkind manager I was always afraid of, grabbed me by the cell and dragged me to the sunset cell.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to get to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught off-marriage on board a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, the deeply disillusioned Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It was not a very thoughtful decision," she said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
"Seven other candidates had already taken part in the race, and another candidate was the last thing they needed."
Some called the situation "Sweetness and Seven Dwarves."
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in the fundraiser, so she made a promise that she would not take part in the race if she didn't save $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret the support of men for $1,000, had only given her $250.
"They think I'm gonna get a cut?" she wondered.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not hold a formal campaign, she was emboldened – thanks to the people who supported it, the disillusionment of the system, which made it very difficult to collect money, and made her focus less on the voters than the members of the House of Representatives, and the anger of sexism.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," says Miss Schrader, "the press reaction.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
Did I think about what they'd write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The experts believe that the first steps in the US-China trade war have been desperate, and, although far before it is over, in the long-term perspective, the split between countries can benefit Beijing.
US President Donald Trump made the first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese export goods, including solar, steel, and aluminium.
This week's worst situation has been the new product fares of $200 billion (150 billion pounds), which actually tax half of all the goods that come to the US from China.
Peking paid back with the same coin every time, recently putting a tomato in the size of five to ten percent on American goods for a sum of 60 billion dollars.
China has committed itself to similar US measures, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to miss the opportunity to keep to that promise in the near future.
To force Washington to back off means to accept the demands, but for China's president, Xi Jingpin, the US's public worship is too shameful.
But, as experts say, if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure in the US trade war can bring China a long-term advantage, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic fall in any country, and this is in fact a greater threat than the observers have previously admitted," said an analyst, Abigail Grace, who deals with Asian-related issues at the Center for New American Security.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs said that Syria was "prepared" for the return of the refugees
In Syria, it is claimed that they are ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and are seeking help in rebuilding a country devastated by the war that lasted for over seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"The real situation today has become more stable and secure because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rebuild the terrorized areas so that people can return to normal life.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have had to abandon because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and limited their means of subsistence.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Mu'alem stated that the Syrian government would gladly accept the help to rebuild a war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the riot.
Europe fortifies the victory of the Rider Cup in Paris
The European team conquered the Ryder Cup in 2018, when the U.S. team won a sum of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. team had lost six times in Europe and had not won the Cup of Ryder tour since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikkelson, who worked hard for most of the tour, hit his first long-distance strike on the 16th hole of steam-3 in the water and gave in to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever had an account of between 5 and 0 from the start of the tour in the modern form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit was defeated with a score of 5:4 from the lowest-rated player in the European Turbine Olesen team in Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world ratings, gave up account 2:1 to Jan Polter of England, who may have taken part in the last round of the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish man, Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Cup of Ryder, who had already taken part in the tour eight times, became a European who had won most of the tournaments all the time, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a hard year.
Thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, so glad to return the cup.
It's a team's credit, and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia, not holding back his emotions after winning Europe.
He's handing over the esophete to his countryman John Reem, who won the American golf legend of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single game with a score of 2:1.
"I'm incredibly proud of defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four games and now has a career record for the Cup of Ryder 13–21–3.
Amazing statistics for one of the most prominent players of all time, who won 14 towers of "Major", went only to Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. Hall, during all weekends, was trying to get to the fairway zone, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed high-level golf throughout the tour.
U.S. Captain Jim Furik said about his team after a disconcerting speech, "I'm proud of these guys, they've been fighting.
This morning, we briefly dominated Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the U.S. Association of Professional Players and the Touring Committee of the Ryder Cup, and we're going to move forward.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We can't help but commend them.
We lost."
Current information on the red tide: decreasing concentration in the districts of Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota
The recent report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife shows a general decline in the level of red-coloured microorganisms in some parts of the Gulf of Tampa.
According to the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife, the conditions of rich blossom reported in certain districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier show a decline in concentration.
The color of red microorganisms stretches about 130 miles of the coastline from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee.
The patches can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but less than last week.
The red tide was also observed in the district of Pasco.
Last week, an average concentration was reported in the district of Pinellas and in its coastal zone, a concentration from low to high in the coastal zone of the Hillsborough district, a high concentration in the district of Manat, a high concentration in the district of Sarasota and in its coastal zone, an average concentration in the district of Charlotte, a high concentration in the district of Li and its coastal zone, and a low concentration in the district of Collier.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier, they continue to report blowing breath.
No such messages were recorded in the northwest of Florida last week.
