You're with Tom, right?
I need to change.
Do you have a headache?

Are you alone now?
Just let Tom finish his routine.
Why did Tom escape?
Did he stay here before?
Tom's afraid of Mary's dog.
You want a brat?
There's only one week left for Halloween.

I bought a lot of books.
Sit here, please.
Tom was not hungry.
Ask Tom if he can do it.
Sitting by night will harm your health.
Did you know Tom left town?
They love us.
I don't need a computer.
Really?
Let's go now, or we'll be late.
That's your main problem.
No matter what, he's still making a fool of himself.

Tom doesn't want you to do it.
Have I changed so much?
Have you ever lived in a foreign country?
When did you get home?
It'll be hot tomorrow.

Why does it matter?
Why are you staying with Tom?

Tom's an infant.
Where is the subway station?
No one knows how I feel.
I guess Tom won't be here today.
We want to stay for three more nights.

I got to the point.
I really don't know how else I can explain it.
I'm not sure Tom knows what to do.
You're taller than me.
That's great!
Tom bought Mary a Christmas present.
I realized I'm not ready.

I've never heard Tom speak French.
I thought you said Tom was your brother.
Is he honest?
Tom's not telling me the truth.
Do you know this song?
I want to know exactly how Tom died.
Life is sometimes so unfair.
I don't plan on doing it anymore.
Tom has full money in his suitcase.
Idiot!
I loved Lila's sister.
I bought this book for ten dollars.
Tom's a lot older than he looks.
Don't be too stubborn.
I'll be back at 6:30.
Can I ask you a few questions?
They all came back to see Tom.
Where's Dad?
After that, he took off his glasses.
A short hair suits her very well.
Tom's got it.
Take the chicken before you cook it.
I felt relieved when I said everything I wanted to say.
I bought Tom a sweater.
It's done like this.
I love cats.
Are you looking for something specific?
Whose fault is that?
No one's stopping you.
Tom wants to join the team.
You're too skinny.
Come here.
There's a map on the wall.
You're very pretty.
I came to see you.
What's your favorite pizza stuff?
The final point of view has many supporters in Japan.
You don't think you could do that?
I don't know what I can do for you.
Tom's smart.
He's annoying.
If you go, I'll miss you.
Point the smart guy to a mistake, and he'll thank you, point the bad guy to a mistake, and he'll offend you.
That's a great idea.
I don't think there's anything in there.
Make your point clear.
They don't know us.
Tom probably forgot to tell Mary about it.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
I'll invite Tom to dinner.
Maybe I'll do it again.
You really think I'd do that?
It's a lie.
The war took away their happiness.
I'd like to have enough money to buy a car.
Mary took off her laptop.
Don't play with the key.
Wouldn't Tom like to do it?
This bridge is by no means safe.
Can it wait?
I don't have a big bag like Tom's.
You're disloyal.
I like to drink.
She's selling an old-fashioned hat.
I like cats more than dogs.
Mary says she can't help us today.
You can go if you know it.
He confessed his guilt.
Tom's convinced Mary's guilty.
The show will be Friday.
I'd eat the bull.
I wonder if Tom can do it.
We're sure we'll deal with it.
His home country is Germany.
It's an orange.
He's an atheist.
What does your aunt do?
I was playing with the champ.
Tom warned you it might happen.
In fact, I don't agree with you.
Mary said she believed it.
When are you leaving?
I have a lot of friends.
I wish I could stay here forever.
She always has time after lunch.
The land covers a smaller part of the earth's surface.
I have a twin.
We begged Tom not to go there.
I think we might have been too aggressive.
You're big.
I have some free time.
I'll help you tomorrow.
This story entertained me.
Watch your head!
I'll miss you.
Take this.
Tom asked you to do something?
Tom's dog's name is Cookie.
I just changed the password.
I didn't do anything.
It took me about three hours to read the book.
The tooth fairy is a tooth thief.
I thought you'd like it.
Tom didn't want to wait.
I'm faithful.
I'm not very patient.
Jesse didn't speak French, and German was worse.
I just want to talk to them.
We didn't do anything wrong.
I get in trouble a lot.
Tom's still doing what he's supposed to do.
He married my brother.
She's teaching us French.
He was not at the meeting.
It's Tuesday.
Someone must have told Tom, but it wasn't me.
Don't worry, we're on our way.
The fire was quickly extinguished.
He took a picture of the family.
We've been to Troms a lot.
English Bush is perfect.
Do you know what kind of blood group Tom has?
I've never been to Europe.
Tom's trying to avoid arguing with Mary.
They'll understand.
There's only one store all over the island.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do it.
Tom is deeply confused.
Is anyone here?
Don't call me.
It's better to die standing up than to live on your knees.
Tom's waiting.
Everybody likes Tom.
I knew you'd wait for us.
I can't forget her.
They chose a new government.
Please wait five minutes.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Bring me a clean plate and take the dirty.
Tom told me he was on his own.
Here's the church we got married to.
I don't think Tom's gonna be here.
I think it makes sense.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.
He was popular among the polls.
Tom didn't give up the French bill.
Elizabeth, Queen of England.
Where do I go?
Tom followed Mary’s example.
He gave me a pencil.
It's not that far from here.
Last year I intended to visit Rome.
This patient can die at any moment.
It was an accident.
I feel that if I had spoken more often to a medium, my English skills would have improved quickly.
The baths are yellow.
We need answers.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Maybe Tom didn't do what everyone said he did.
How's life?
Wouldn't it be better if Tom did it to someone else?
When was the last time you were in Australia?
Vegan itself.
This machine is morally obsolete.
All of them prayed.
How many examples do you need?
I'm the best.
Don't die.
I'll be there to help you.
Dance.
I have a great teacher.
He needs to be killed.
What will we eat tonight?
Have you found them yet?
You have to give her more time.
What are you doing with it?
She's hard on it.
You're such an idiot!
My dad bought me a book.
Tom's energy-intensive.
So a lot of things didn't like.
Tom knew Mary wouldn't be busy.
Dry sand picks up water.
You always loved Tom, right?
Here you go!

He passed the test.
Whose friend are you?
Tom's too tired to be busy.
Tom threw Mary the ball.
Tom's pretty persuasive, isn't he?
I miss talking to them.
He tried not to cry.
They're sorry.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Who told you I did it?
It's never too late.
Leave me alone, I'm asleep.
Aren't you ready for more?
Tom has no idea why Mary lied.
Tom's looking for a job.
Father will be back in a few days.
Is it true that Midori is very good at violin?
Well, that explains it.

Tell us something.
I'm glad you're doing this.
Since I didn't get the answer, I texted her again.
What do you want to say about this?
You think it's a trap?
People, stop killing each other.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were planning to do it.
I borrowed a car from Tom.
I don't think I could spend six hours alone with you.

Is that annoying to you?
What's in the box?
Careful, it's still hot.

Did you win?
She can speak English pretty well.
I have to go.

What he did was not wrong.
Can you give me a moment?
Is there anything cold to drink?

It's unlikely I'll be there tonight.
I don't trust you.
It travels the world.
Boys are fine.

Tom started to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He runs to the station every morning.
They're running out of food.
Not here.
No one was content.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I was trying to sleep.
Tom's always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just sent me a text message.
So somewhere in this building.
We're open tomorrow.
I didn't expect to turn things around like that.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There's got to be some logic.
Did you work last night?
How did you convince Tom to help us paint the cliff?
Were you in the capital of the United States, Washington?

Can't you lift me up?
I'm not pregnant.
He didn't crash.
I have a question.
There's not enough!
Tom said Mary was probably still doing it.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The boss let me go early today.
What time is the end of the world?
I'm never worried.
How sweet!
When I'm in bad humour, I start to sing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
It's gonna be pretty cold tonight.
I won't ask Tom for help.
How much you paid to do it.

I know you're here.
It's half a third.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
There is no great hope.
It's not mine.
What exactly do you want, Tom?
We're almost done.
So we have to be home by 2:30.
You go to school on foot?
Is that Tom's girl?
Tom's wasting his time.
Molecule is made up of atoms.
We know that.

Where do you live now?
You know, he's just been through a hard time.
Tom married a neighbor.
My head hurts.
Say it again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.

It's good weather, isn't it?
Come if you can.
I hate it!
You're a little too young for me.
Tom's too old for you.

Are you ready to hear the bad news?
I talked to them.
Has Lucy called?
Looks like Tom.
You don't have to do that if you don't want to.
I was just about to wash up.
Sweet!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do that?
Mary wants me on her team.
No one else listens.
You're brave.

I used to live here.
They're not from town?
Fuck him.
I think we talked on the phone.
I think we can apologize to Tom.
Tom wants his money today.
Why is Tom and Mary so concerned?
He asked me if I could do him a favor.
I'm really busy.

I'm pretty sure we can trust Tom.
Tom spoke only French.
All the answers to that question were wrong.

I've never been to a French-speaking country.
She's five years younger than me.
You go to school on foot?

Do you have any brothers?
To your future!

We don't do that.
How could we do that?
Stay out of it.

You're gonna need more money, right?
Why are you doing this?
I work here for a few minutes.

I feel a lot of pain in the cross.
Tom's always home.
Tom texted Mary.
I had a good meal.
It is not wise of you to reject his offer.

Where do they speak English?
Maybe Tom's bored.
I was hoping Tom wouldn't be busy.
I have to go.
Tom meditates on going to serve.

So, thirteen years.
They don't give anything.
I think the problem is here.
Oh, he messed up the air.
Tom said I can't come in.
It's not a sentence.
We're not idiots.
She's been holding her breath.
I thought it was vegetarians.

I have two brothers and one sister.
So we need protection.

She was not polite to him.
Tom showed me how to do it in a number of ways.
Anyway, what's your plan?
Where's the original?
Italians rarely talk about politics.

There's nothing else in the box.
Wake up!
Yeah, I've been there for years.
Did you see her today?
I know you won't do it.
What did you get for Christmas?

I'm back today.
Tom's sick.
I should've told you earlier.
They married at the age of 17.
You can stay.
This video is boring.
Why didn't you help him?
He's stronger than you.
Aren't you in line tonight?
I need to clean up the desktop.
I have ten more pens than you do.
I'm not sure I want to see it.

Please write this down.
I'm not unlettered.
I don't think Tom's gonna forget how it's done.
The evening is at nine and thirty.
I'm waiting for it.
I expected more.
I thought I'd be rich.
I lied.
I have a lot of free time.
What do you think?
Did you know I had a blog?
Why do you hate them?
Did you play tennis last night?
I'll give you everything you ask for.
No one's laughing at my jokes.
I'm a potato.

Just help me.
I know what it looks like.
The policeman was drunk.
The experts aren't convinced.
Tom leaned down to kiss Mary in the cheek.
I'll get to the point, you're fired.
It's not the only problem.
Have you ever been abroad?
I'm proud.
Don't you see what Tom and Mary are doing?
More and more people offered to help.
Did you pay for the rent?
You made a huge mistake.
Tom trusts him.
I guess that's why she didn't like it.
Pass me the butter, please.
Did you know Tom was Mary's cousin?

Why do you live here?
Take the children with you.
I'd like you to be here with me.

My whole life revolves around love.
Whites start and win.
I'm in the driver's class.
My dad's not home right now.
Do you have a minute?
I don't need to convince them.
The meeting will not be rescheduled.
What's the alternative?
Many speak only one language.
Everyone who knew him was fascinated by him.
Last night I met on Mary Street.
Do you have a job?
Why don't we go dancing?
You know it's a lie, right?
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.
I think Tom can convince Mary to do it.
Tom and Mary are rich.
The dog is white.
That was our plan.
Talk quietly.
Who are you planning to go to in Boston?
Are you planning to rent a car?
I always feel sleepy.
I'm also planning to do that.
This is a picture of the sister.
Am I that different from you?
You're a beautiful butterfly.
I already knew that.
I saw Tom beat Mary.
Tom slipped on the crisis and fell.
I just want to go on vacation.
I'm sure he's coming.

I used to play baseball when I was young.
He wrote a lot of stories.
Tom's gonna be worried.
She called the psychiater.
Did you hear about last night's fire?
What's your favorite color?
Tomorrow's a big day.
Is the job over?
Get some water.
The cookie is colorful.
Tom smiled at the waitress.
You're not needed.
Tom can't buy that car.
Even a child could handle it.
Do you have a copy of that report?
Tom will never wake up.
That's enough for now.
I was able to swim.
Did you buy Tom a dog?
Looks like everyone's busy.
I can't accept that.
You're very good.
Take it.
Tom's past.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Tom said I had to do it.
It's gonna be okay.
Today I'll see Mary.
I haven't read any of these two books.
I saw it on YouTube.
It's the typical autumn of the weather.
I usually go to school on foot.
Paint the picture.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
What time is the taxi going to the airport?
Stay with Tom in this room.
Walking a little bit.
I didn't want you to get up that early.
She's eating.
I live in Warsaw.
I want you to be my friend.
It's his car.
You're going to church tomorrow?
Grab the rope.
I respect your opinion.
I don't agree with the theory that you need to learn Latin to get a better understanding of English.
I don't have my own children.
You have a lot of time.
Tom's alive?
Would you like some tea?
It happened three years ago.
You're sick, you need to rest.
The bear has a short tail.
He was amazed.
I hate it too.
We met before school.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
I shouldn't have bought it.
What else do you want?
They don't look happy.
It's a real person.
I don't trust you.
I'm a Ukrainian.
Can I go home?
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do it.
Time to go.
Tom ran as fast as he could.
I can't open the door.
When did it start?
I love fries.
He's almost always in the hospital.
I just moved in.
Who are you, and what are you doing here?
Thank you for yesterday.
Tom says he's got a tenor.
Don't listen to him, he's making some nonsense.
It's just the ragings that are on the ground.
Tom, can you get up?
I don't even have a job.
What are you gonna use it for?
Tom lost a man a few months ago.
I'm a little tired.
You have to help me get Tom.
Tom heard Mary scream.
Take off the hat.
There's no reason to regret it now.
Tom said he noticed the difference.
I don't want my hands dirty.
I have a strong fever.
Tom's plan didn't fit anywhere.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
Tom is very interested in astrology.
Please, hurry up.
I'm not convinced yet.
I've heard it's hot in Boston this time of year.
What's up, Miss Jones?
I'm the only one who had to do it.
I have a lot of credit cards.
I'm mad at Tom.
I'll sue you.
Put it here.
Tom told Mary, and Mary told John.
He showed me his album.
Wouldn't you rather do it to Tom?
Who was running?
I hate my neighbors.
Who can explain this to me?
I'm in love with Tom's friend.
Am I early?
It looks serious.
Red is not your color.
I'm not sure if Tom does it or not.
Tom went first.
Are you mad at Tom?
Mary lacks good reason.
I don't go to school on Sunday.
Tom's dog bit Mary's hand.
Have you bought Christmas presents yet?
I gave him my address.
I woke up early enough to catch the first train.
Don't jump!
Those who want peace prepare for war.
Everyone loves Tom.
Of course, he knows the answer.
It's just a dream.
Is it still here?
He's legit to her.
I just want to rest.
I hope you have an allibi.
I hate journalists.
Tom's out of town again.
How's it going?
I never drink alone.
I didn't know Tom was younger than you.
So Boston doesn't like it at all.
I want to rest.
I have Tom's keys.
She's got white teeth.
Tom and Mary went to the music festival.
Tom's kids are downstairs.
Tom looks forward to it.
I'd like to rent a car.
Why do you ask?
We can't protect you.
His car has no wheels.
Go fuck both of you!
I realized that I was being followed.
You need to be careful when you choose your friends.
China is the largest country in Asia.
Aren't you mad at Tom yet?
You and Tom better not argue.
As good a poop, with age, it's just getting better.
You're selling alarms?
They're very interested in astronomy.
I'm sorry I made you wait so long.
I'm not blaming anyone else.
Tom is our French teacher.
Did you bring some coffee?
The next day the pain came back.
This book is better than that.
I think Tom will win.
We can win this war.
Thanks, it's okay.
The video has become viral.
What did you do to my hand?
Mary knows the police are looking for her.
I told Tom the joke.
Can we come too?
You're doctors.
How do you like this town?
I like your coffee.
Tom wakes up.
How much in one night?
I'm twice your age.
Mary's like my own daughter.
It wasn't Tom, it was Mary.
This is justified.
You're too nervous.
Have you ever seen this logo?
About the same time, Tom was in his room and was studying.
Tom said he didn't think Mary really like doing it on her own.
I know it's easy for you.
Tie that sticker to your bag.
I thought you said you were the only kid in the family.
I have some French books.
When Peter got up, John had already left the house.
I'm gonna fly for the first time tomorrow, isn't it incredible?
Thank you for your attention.
He was guilty.
My ex-boyfriend is a thief!
Tom was mad at Mary.
Tom will be very sad.
I'm picking up the wheat.
Tom didn't have time to do his homework.
They threw him through another man.
How much water do we have?
Tom said he thought he should do it.
Stop here.
I'm fine.
Tom told me he was desperate.
Turn the key to the right.
I'm staying in a cheap hotel.
Mom, what's the address of Santa? I'd like to write him a letter.
I'm from a big family.
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?
His parents seem to have had no problem with it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary really like doing it on her own.
There are exceptions to each rule.
Tom knew something bad was about to happen.
No one cares what you think.
They voted.
I refuse to talk to you!
It's red.
I enjoyed talking to him at the party.
Nothing I did helped.
You're absolutely right.
The kid and the girl are sitting on the fence.
I screamed.
This box is a little hard.
They're from Sweden.
They sent me to save you.
Tom understands.
Tom's used to it.
Tom works all night.
She's not always happy.
I'm sure Tom will do whatever Mary asks him to do.
They're good.
Do you have a subway map?
I'm not the same as any other mother's witch.
I underestimated the power of the adversary.
Which floor are we on?
Tom's getting nervous.
Tom can wait here.
A brother lives in Boston.
I've always liked him.
What a strange life!
You can do whatever you want.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Sadly, she already has a permanent lover.
I bought them all for a present.
Someone's calling.
When does this end?
Tom was a spy.
I didn't know you had a car.
She's listening to him.
The soup is too hot.
He fell on the ground.

Am I interrupting something?
I know how to ski.
Do what they tell you to do.
I'm looking for you.
Some did not want to fight.
Do you know why Tom's not drinking?
His book inspired me.
I don't believe Tom's coming back.
I measured the hat.

He's a slut.
What's a computer?
I'm not illiterate.
Did you sing it yourself?
What do you suggest?
Tom decided to do it.
Your meds are ready.
I thought you were curious.
Well, everyone's his own, right?
I was so excited I couldn't sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was upset.
She was a foreigner, and she was treated like a foreigner.
Karen went there by herself.
Do I seem nervous?
The girl we saw was waiting for someone outside Tom's house, Mary.
Why don't you stop smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He asked himself why his wife left him.
I think I put too much sugar.
Do you know how to ride a mat?
I know how it's done.

Horses are useful animals.
Come back soon.
He's incompetent.

He's unbearable.
He's sure he's putting up an exam.
Tom voted for the offer.
Tom told you how long it took him to do it?
Let's get started!
Attention!
I'm exhausted.
The prospects are not too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm fascinated by the Devil's literature.
The problem is that she lacks experience.
I spent a while in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their baby John.
I wonder if Tom is actually going to Mary's concert.
Tom said, did he spend the past weekend with this?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us how to sing.
Let's not do anything.
Tom wants his father to be buried next to his mother.
You don't think we'd notice?
Your supper was so tasty!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't.
I'm a di-jay.
I hate Christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It's too expensive.
A child was lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to hold back.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows a lot of people.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're gonna lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Talk to me.
The surface of the balloon is a non - Euclidean space, so it is not subject to euclide geometry.
The talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I've never killed anyone.
Be honest and direct.
There is always hope.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice the age of me.
The journalist was kidnapped by terrorists.
I missed the ball.
I hate this town.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
Programming is his hobby.
I'm glad to hear it.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many watches do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
So I don't like to eat fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is very proud of you.
Your doctor says you're gonna be okay.
You're a panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need that money.
My cranberry's sour.
Tom's still crying?
So I'd like to be higher.
I have to help my mom.

It's not my idea.
You have a plan, don't you?
He's out.
Tom's not in town.
I had a bad shoe.
Next year's gonna be worse.
Mary's in yellow dress.
Love has a bitter smile.
The meeting was over.
You should have done it last year.
I thought I couldn't do it.
I've got an old car.
We understand why.
I eat every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
Let's take the elevator.

You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She skipped school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom doesn't think I should do it.
Public debt is rising.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom's probably never gonna do that.
That doll.
Get out of here!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Tom still has a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do it.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the Internet.
You're adorable.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's go meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't stop it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's coming in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We can talk.
A computer can count very quickly.
You're not needed.

Tom won't bother you any more.
Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change a diaper.

For the best, or worse, TV has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.
He was easy to answer my question.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He must be innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When is she coming?
That's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm so glad I did it yesterday.
Tom still lives next to you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw the stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I talk.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you meet him a lot?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You're gonna stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, excuse me.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in the 2000s.
Tom's probably gonna take care of it.
It has to be the right color.
Tom's got a very strict mom.
After a brief peace, war broke out again.

Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?

I don't understand your French.
What's the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you hand me the sugar?
Where exactly is Tom planning to build his home?
"Where's my laptop?" - "On the table."
I don't think there's gonna be any problem.
Tom's broken up?
You need to get a haircut.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing football.
How does this work?
You're very ugly.
Hurry up, guys.
I'll fix my shirt.
When is it expected to return?
I had a good rest.

We don't expect to win.
I don't have any money.
I'm not teaching here anymore.

Take the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a di-jay.
Tom will soon learn to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They know how to fish.
Tom left the room.
I'm still doing it every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He won the first prize.
Tom's teaching French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thinks he can do it.
I don't have any books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He's kind of a robot man.
Answer the question!
You're needed in the hospital.
I can't find the lifts.
It's a forgery.
It's not Tom asked Mary to do it.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was the best.
Tom is often mistaken.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true Tom was never in Australia?
Now I know.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, and there was a Grand Prie.
Tom's proud of his daughter.
Don't tell me.
I'm rich.
Did you consider the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
English is not my language.
I had no friends in Australia.
Do you think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So don't do it again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom stared at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the children while she is away.
I'm going to cook.

Do you want to dance?
He's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom shook his head?
Why would Tom do that?

I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have many friends.
Do you believe in the existence of a god?
I live in Boston.
Tom's blind since he was born.
He didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don't you get bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I'm not working for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I was trying to do that.
I wrote a book.
Silence, please.
I bought my son's new sleds.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister, Sakiko, who was born the same year as I am, and now she's getting ready for exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you finished your homework?
Monday will probably be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help Tom paint the fence.
Why do humans act like big apes, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Asshole.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go see a doctor.
I've submitted the documents to the visa.
It's snowing today.
She continued to work.
The moth broke when we went to the mountain.
Tom's driving.
If you ate less hamburgers, you'd probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go in person.
Please show me how this is done.
Aren't you dating anyone?
All the shops are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What's the date today?
Where's Dad?
Lock the door.
I'm not talking to Tom French.
The apple doesn't fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
The uncle is the brother of your father or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She's got red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was wearing jeans.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
That's my grandmother.
It's a whale.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do it to you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Do you mind?
I haven't seen you in all eternity.
You're obviously right.
Who's the book?
That's what you want to do, right?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks dogs twice a day.
Let me look at Tom's book.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honsu, and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have a lot of money in the bank.
I think we need to go now.
We didn't do it.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I can't help you.
It's broken.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can match it in a tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you realize that?
She committed suicide.
We've set up our office with computers.
We have to pay in time.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Don't you plan on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot of stuff.
I'm wearing shoes.
You can count on me.
His book was the object of criticism.
It's gonna be genius.
I'm so scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's a lot worse.
I'm out of control.
You didn't waste any time.
Who knows when Tom's gonna do it?
Tom was witnessing in the Mary case.
I thought you'd gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask your name?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Aren't you gonna vote?
You need to stop smoking.
I think Tom is disloyal.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play violin?
Will you hand me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks well French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
He was popular both among the students and among the professors.
Tears of grief can't help.
Tom's playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom can't speak French?
He always sings when he showers.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up the listener.
I'll be right back.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do it.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell him to do it.
He speaks esperanto with a small French accent.
It's not yours.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't get around it.
She's got good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom will come to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady's helper.
I'll deal with it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a wizard?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Get off me.
Will you let Tom kill you?
You're a good woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Tom actually moved to Boston?
Tom stretched out Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
The speakers follow the rules of their language in a subconscious way, without even being aware of them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters aimed their rifles at the elephant.
There's no wavering.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom’s wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do it.
I'd like to take the money.
I shake Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You don't have to worry about tomorrow's exam.
Tom was voting?
I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do it.
Tom started sewing.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You can't escape.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where'd you spend your weekends?
This year you got a Christmas present from Tom?
I'm still a bit bored with home, and so many things seem strange to me.
I have a memory problem sometimes.
Where's Mom?
He regained consciousness three hours after the crash.
Do you speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me right now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know why?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a bit behind the chart.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a taxi?
Hurry up, you'll be late.
It's gonna be hard.
Is Tom always like that?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait-wait, did you say "girl" or "boyfriend"?
It'll work, you'll see.
She left him.
Tom's safe.
I finally got my driver's license.
I'm not a student.
So Mary was sorry.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's the wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom is not rich, Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone's late, except me.
Stop it!
It's a book.
I'm not planning to rock the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with a client.
I'm disappointed in your efficiency.
Haven't you had a car before?
Were you at work?
What do you learn?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Hello.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom's going to the party tonight.
I was talking.
She was on her way to the airport.
She studies Portuguese in Brazil.
What do you tell them?
How did you know this was gonna happen?
What is it?
If the natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, the esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's gonna be in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so mad.
Tom has a good garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We'll go on foot.
Tom said what exactly happened?
I finally realized I'm not in love with you.
Did you tell me because I was kidding?
So it was so boring.
Tom said I was good.
I'll be at the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you know?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take the trash out.
Don't you come back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston map?
Your sister is as good as ever.
It's gonna be very hard to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like those perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him to work, you need to consider his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
It's his obsessive idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly left the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a Sin-Doctor.
I know it won't be possible.
Do you have something from the main pain?
Children are like friends, not parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with his friends outside.
Whatever happens, keep calm.
Tom sent a message to Mary.
He's always happy.
When Mary got to the bus stop, the last bus was on its way.
Tom's in his black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my baby.
We used to speak French.
Bananas taste good.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're worthless.
Have you tried talking to them?
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
Her friends mocked her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom can win.
Aliens come and take our work from us, Earth for the Earth!
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
You're gonna take the train?
Tom said Mary was good.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, right?
So you still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad, and he never came back.
Put your toys together.
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm feeling better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why I'm curious.
Have you finished your job yet?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not hard to do.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I've never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was hard.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I still wanted to sell it.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't.
You've missed something.
I called Tom right away.
You looked interested.
It'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to achieve his goal.
Ken's got two cats.
I realized what my mistake was.
I love trips.
The phone's not working.
That's what we want.
Tom's in the sunscreen.
Tom's a good painter.
All you have to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can you rent a Halloween suit?
Tom's busy and can't help you right now.
We're not a couple.
A student wants to see you.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm getting hot.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Tom really thinks someone's listening?
No change!
Tom, you might say, is good.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I should've left earlier.
I met him by chance.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a grunt.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
You know?
Tom was not rude to me.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
Could you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This table is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I was playing baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got the ticket for nothing.
You're such an unbearable man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did my best.
No, sir, it's free.
I'm very interested in studying French.
Be good to the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight I can borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't believe anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your job.
Do you work around here?
You admit it, don't you?

Sometimes a dog is a dangerous animal.
Oh, please don't say that.
Spring is my favorite time of year.
I think it might happen.
We lost three games in a row.
Tom really told you that?
The eyeballs are in the garden somewhere.
We're trying.

Is there a boat park near here?
I don't have time or money for this.

He's selling cars.
They were my friends.
I found something very interesting.

Maybe Tom's tired.
I don't think we can do that.

We'll try.
Tom shared Mary's pain.
They're sick of playing.
I can't forget her smile.
I hope Tom didn't do what you asked him to do.

Good job!

I'll wait here till he gets here.
Tom can drive.
I read novels on purpose.
I was gonna tell Tom, but I forgot.
I'm a hero.
They love us.
I really need your help.
Tom betrayed you.
I got up about six.
I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty smart.
Does it matter?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Tom might not even get on the team.
I ask myself if I can trust him.
What happened to her?
Are you drinking?
I got mad.
When did he arrive?
Where's your teddy bear?
What's up, Tom?
Maybe this year we'll finally win in Europe.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I was able to forget my wallet.
Cats catch mice.
You can go.

Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do it.
Why would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the magnetic field of the Earth with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
It's Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in!
Are you planning on doing this somehow?
Am I clear?
I'm free today.
Tom will probably be punished for doing it.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
There's no need to rush.
Are you satisfied?
I didn't believe him at first.
The phone's not working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Come in.
Tom can be fined if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really not smart.
Tom is my older brother.

Thank you for your help.

The earth went from father to son.
No roses without spikes.
I hope it's not them.
Don't drink too much, huh?
Tonight, wait for a surprise.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I love watching TV.
He left the family.
Let's go?
You don't need to contact Tom.

I'm the boss.
Tom did a good job.
You have to get home by 9:00.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted he did.
Tom can't drive.

We were ready.
I'm worried that I might get sued.
My homeland lives here.
Tom's listening.
I got away with it.
Tom speaks well French.
I know I'm going to learn a lot.
I went out on Monday to fish.
Mary loved her dog.
Party's over.
The unicycle has one wheel.
"Dad, look over there, shark!" "This whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very kind.
I'm a nerd.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my mistake, not Tom's.
The congregations went pretty well.
This time of the year, the wind is blowing out of the ocean.
I saw Tom smile.
Come on, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned it.
Go and beat that bully.

I'm sorry I did.
Do I have to go to the hospital?
At her spare time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom sings "cantry" better than any of my friends.
He drinks a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how dressed she is.
Did you see his new movie?
I'm good at it.
Why did he quit?
Tom said Mary's gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she's not sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unbiased idea is that it's a terrible movie.
You're very elegant.
Whatever you want.
I could change.
It's real.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
She's in Tom's.
Tom was barefoot.
I did my best.
If you see a bug, correct it, please.
We tried it again, but it didn't work.

You can't pay for it if you cry.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to climb that mountain.
Tom missed lunch.
You speak English well.
He loved his parents.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you'll be back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love can't be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What is this theater?
Did you see the squirrel?
Mary said Tom told her.
Tom was not a very good witness.
I went to visit my grandmother.
I hate the wedding.
I heard the door in the front.
I don't catch up with you.
Mary's a great dancer.
My grandfather is from Osaka.
I want to massage, I need to relax.
Tom's so lucky.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you get a nap?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did it.
When do you think Tom's gonna be here?
Is it snowing tonight?
Do you care?
Are you seeing someone here?
I live in Milan.
When did she do anything for me?
I ate the orange.
The square root of the two is an irrational number.
It's small.
Didn't you know it was gonna happen?
Bad thoughts produce bad actions.
Did you bring the fen?
Tom's not wrong.
Do you have the rent from this bill?
Tom seems a little embarrassed.
We can't do without water.
I can't get my head together.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in a village.
I'd never give up.
I speak fluent French.
Tom didn't waste time on it.
Insinuate me.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He was very drunk.
Tom says he's happy.
How are you feeling now?
How many guys do you have in your class?
It's a big apple.
Choose a good gift.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something like that?
The richest man in the world could not buy his love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
The absence of news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers are saving us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You've been to London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I'm walking slow.
After the movie, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We're getting married in June.
I wonder if Tom left Boston.
I threw my bones.
The book was short of a number of pages.
I picked up the coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks a promise.
We have to protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sarah don't get along very well.
Every student has his or her own desk.
I spent about 12 hours.
I'm gonna be sorry about that.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom's not thirsty.
I learned to eat the cow.
I'm all right.
I'm sorry I'm not rich.
She was very upset by the news.
I have a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see it yourself.
I've never killed anyone.
What's your name?
She's holding the flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man is in his mid-nineties.
This coffee is so hot I can't drink it.
Where did you get that?
Are we done?
You're from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're good at doing this, aren't you?
These apples taste good.
Can I borrow your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She's got red blood.
What's wrong?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way to rest.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?
Tom didn't do anything we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom lied to us.
Tom heard Mary got married.
I've learned a lot.
How much is this paraphernalia worth?
Both of them smiled.
What happened?
It's possible.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class got flu.
Remember when you first heard the Beatles?
Did Tom get hurt?
I want you to come to my party.
No toilet paper.
The word is silver, the silence is gold.
Please sit here and wait.
I love that shirt.
Drink the water out of the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom's probably still gonna be mad.
I'll go to the airport.
Don't mind her whims.
I'm glad Tom will help us.
Tom will be here any minute.
Glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see each other again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I asked her out for a date.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you come to China?
Do you approve of what Tom's doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
It's the perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I'm out of bed.
How is this my fault?
With regard to Switzerland, have you been there in the winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm learning Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay the credit bill.
Try to look at it from Tom's point of view.
The window is open.
No one thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom looked pretty sick the last time I saw him.
Tom's still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from nine to five.
Let me do it with you.
Mary was watching a romantic comedy.
Get him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom is such an asshole.
Would you like some more potatoes?
Tom sat.
Tom has a mustache.
I have three questions for you.
I met Tom a few times.
Do you use a text CPU?
Tom and Mary do a lot of things together.
Please move.
What are you doing this evening?
Why did you paint the bench red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak fluent French, don't you?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You don't know how to speak French, do you?
You're not.
Let's go home.
I said hello to Tom.
Tom took off his ring.
I'll make you breakfast.
Tom was listening.
Who broke that window?
Your ideas are a bit out of date.
