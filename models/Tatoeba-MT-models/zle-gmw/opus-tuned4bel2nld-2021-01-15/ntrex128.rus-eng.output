Members of the Welsh Assembly don't want to look like muppets.
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is dissatisfaction with the proposal to accept MWP abbreviations for their name (Member of the Welsh Parliament is a member of the Welsh Parliament).
A problem solution is the plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One of the Laborists, expressing his party's views, expressed concern that the new abbreviation was “ripped by Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, not from Wales: on the Wallian twp means "bitch," and pwp means "cock."
According to a member of the Welsh Party, his organization was generally “unsatisfied” and offered other options.
The members of the Conservative Party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in the Welsh language is spoken about as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting the change of name bill, made the following statement: “The final decision on the name of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be left to them”.
The Welsh Governance Act of 2017, the National Assembly of Wales, has the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published a public opinion poll on the options proposed, according to which the version of the Welsh Parliament instead of the "Assemblies" had found wide support among the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee had expressed a preference for the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP option had received the most public support.
It seems that the members of the Assembly offer other options, but the Presiding Member, Elin Jones, will find it difficult to find a solution that is acceptable to all, and recall that the draft law on change should be submitted in a few weeks.
The reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly's work process, including new rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the organization of the Committee's system.
Members of the Assembly will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote to rename the country as the "Republik of North Macedonia".
A popular vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” presupposes territorial claims against the Greek province, and has repeatedly objected to the entry of its northern neighbour into the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, opponent of the referendum on the change of name, stated that he was not going to accept the results.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, note that changing the name of the country is just the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
The crisis in the parishes of Harlem: the bells of St. Martin's have always been silenced
“The neighborhood I've been talking to used to say that there was a bar and a church at each corner,” Adams says.
“And now there is no more of it.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
"The format of communication has changed."
“The bar has ceased to be a kind of living room for the whole area that has been visited regularly.”
But as far as the churches are concerned, the money received from the sale of assets will not last long, no matter how much their leaders hope. “Everytime, they will be left with nothing.”
At the site of the church, he added, there will be a multi-family home whose tenants are not likely to support those who remain in the parish.
“The majority of the buyers of these flats will be white,” Adams says. “This will bring the day when such churches will close, because new neighbors will never become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black district: the Metropolitan Comunity in 1870, and the St. Martin Church 10 years later.
The first members of the Methodist Church left the parish in the 1930s.
Their building was bought by a black parish next door.
When the Church of St. Martin went to the hands of the black community, it was led by reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, Harlem's main artery of commerce, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
In 1939, the fire caused significant damage to the building, and in the course of the restoration work, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the installation of the carillon.
The reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, who succeeded him at the head of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the Carillon “the colloquiums for the poor.
But the expert who tried the carillon in July called it a different term: “cultural heritage” and “unique historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that it was the Carillon of St. Martin's Church that was the world's first instrument of some kind played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lindh. 18 years ago, he was invited to play the larger Carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's Church has not yet found a replacement.
Over the past few months, the Church of St. Martin has had a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by secular church leaders, and others by the Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, went to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese “will try to transfer the cost of the works” to the parochial assembly, although the latter had no bearing on the choice of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the diocese's lack of transparency.
In California, a shark shot a 13-year-old lobster diver.
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a 13-year-old diver in California was attacked by a shark and injured.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hummel said in an interview with the station KSWB-TV (San Diego), he dived with his friends on Saturday morning and heard a boy scream for help about half an hour later.
According to Hummel, at first he decided that the boy was thrilled to catch the lobster, but quickly “beared that he was yelling, ‘I've been bit!
I've been bit!"
A swim to the diver, Hummel observed that “his skin was completely exploding around the clavicle.”
"I screamed to get everyone out of the water, "Here's a shark," Hummel says.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Redi Children ' s Hospital in San Diego; his condition is assessed as critical.
The type of shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
Squad Captain Larry Giles, in a press briefing, reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks ago at the site but had not been classified as a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack had been injured in the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles observed that there are 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seynsbury is planning to take over the perfume-cosmetic market in the United Kingdom.
Seynsbury is going to set up a cosmetics and perfume department in the Booths, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetics counselors, using the model of a suite store.
The British perfume and cosmetic market is estimated to be £2.8 billion, and it continues to expand, while in the fashion and home goods sector it is falling, and in order to capture a significant proportion of this desirable market as an experiment in 11 stores throughout the country, the vast cosmetics and perfume industries will be represented, and, if successful next year, they will be expected in many other stores.
Supermarket owners are looking for something to fill in the shelves used to be TV, microwave furnaces, home goods, and investments in the perfume-cosmetic market.
According to the representatives of Seinesbury, it is planned to double the number of cosmetic items to 3,000, including for the first time stamps such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, at special locations, by the type of product management in Booths' stores.
In addition, the brand line of the “Buttic Cosmetics” product will be reorganized, switching to vegan products to meet the demands of young buyers.
The Seynsbury two stores will present the French Shop's perfume kiosks, the first of which has already opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second is expected to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of food for each day in small shops close to home have led supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, president of Seinesbury, says that the athletes will gradually become a department store, and his supermarket network is fighting for buyers to compete against cheap stores, such as Aldy and Leedle, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Seynsbury supermarkets host Argos' outlets, and some of them have now been able to find Habitat's stores since the network acquired both stamps two years ago, which has led to an increase in sales of food and revenues from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give new life to their cosmetic and apothecary departments have failed.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Seinsbury and Booths was organized, but there were further disagreements among participants on the sharing of the proceeds of the sale of pharmacy in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Seynsbury Pharmaceutical Business (a total of 281 stores) to Celecio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical Network, for £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a wide line of luxuries for the care of La Roche-Posay and Vicky in four stores.
Says Paul Mills-Hix, business director of Seinsbury: "We have completely transformed the looks and the atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics to create a more favourable environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained counsellors who will always be available to assist the counsel.
Our range of stamps for any taste, pleasant design, and comfortable shopping will attract a lot of visitors to search for cosmetics and perfume, which will be a brand-new concept of shopping.
Peter Jones's "abhorrently" reaction to Holly Willoughby's exit from the £11 million deal.
The star of the show "The Dragon's Logger," Peter Jones, is "infuriated" by Holly Willoughby's TV host from a £11 million deal she was planning to make with Peter's Lifestyle-brand, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their joint pet brand and Truly accessory.
The business of this couple was compared to the stamp of the Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of this morning's programme announced her decision in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their lucrative Lifestyle-brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV has angered Peter Jones, the star of the Dragon's Logo.
According to our sources, Jones was “infuriated” when the favorite of the viewers at a busy meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that, after the new contracts had been concluded at a cost of up to 1.5 million, she would not have enough time for their common brand of housewear and Truly accessory.
Their brand was compared to the baby actress Gwyneth Paltrow with the Goop mark, and it was expected that her sales would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
A 37-year-old host announced her departure from Instagram, while Jones himself left the United Kingdom on a private plane in the direction of one of her villas.
According to one source, "the Truly Mark was Holly's top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give it a careless existence for the next couple of decades.
Her decision has set off all the parties to the deal.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, as the stamps had been on for weeks before the launch.
At Marlowe headquarters, there was a whole warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.
The experts believe that the departure of the host of this morning, one of the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the firm millions of quid due to significant investment in goods, from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay in the start-up of the line.
In addition, it is a long-standing break-up of friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby created the brand of Truly with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company in March.
Both couples often spend their vacations together, and Jones also owns 40% of the firm's shares on Dan Baldwin's television.
Willoughby will be the M&S ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of the ITV show "I am a celebrity".
A source from Jones' close environment said last night, "We can't comment on his business."
Complex talks, "and then we fell in love with each other"
He joked about the criticisms that the media would have against him because of the “unworthy president” comment and the positive appreciation of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Says Trump, imitating the voice of the host.
“I did not give up anything.”
He noted that Kim Jong-un was interested in a re-meeting after Trump called them the first summit held in Singapore in June a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons stockpiles in North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have reached a dead end.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean high-level diplomat Lee Young-ho made a statement to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly meeting on Saturday that North Korea is still waiting for a “appropriate response” from the US after the initial disarmament measures of the DPRK.
Instead, the US, noted the diplomat, continues to use sanctions as leverage.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
“The situation with North Korea is great,” he said.
“We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un had borne fruit: the missile tests had been put to an end, the hostages had been released, and the United States troops who had remained in the territory of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea had also returned to their country.
Referring to his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not strange.
“It's easy to tell the president, but then, instead of 10,000 people on the street, who are rushing into this full-blown hall, there would be only 200 people,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd that was gathered in front of him.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction, hundreds of casualties
In the first days after the earthquake that struck Lombok, a foreign NGO said that there was no need for their help.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lomboca population had lost a roof over its head, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national disaster, which was a precondition for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that there is no need for international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is training a team to go to Palau, but we don't know if a foreign group can work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palau in order to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
Given the ongoing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains horrendously ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other shorelines.
Despite the warning of the tsunami, a siren was not included in Palau to alert the population, which is likely to have led to so many casualties.
Transport between the many Indonesian islands is problematic, even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital, previously moored in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake, is heading to Palau, but the road to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made the strengthening of Indonesia's old infrastructure the focus of his campaign and spent immense resources on improving roads and railroads.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for a new term next year, has become overwhelmed by funding problems.
The President has also been criticized for exacerbating sectarian strife between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people had been killed and tens of thousands had lost their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows with arrows and other self-shooting.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score against Chelsea naked to the far upper corner of the gate
Daniel Starridge saved the Liverpool from defeating the 89th minute of the first league match against Chelsea, held on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge got a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27 meters from the Chelsey gate when his team was playing with a score of 1-0.
He moved to the left and punched in the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and ended up in the long top of the net.
Golquiper Kepa Arrisabalagha jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Starridge said, "It was all about getting in that position and getting the ball, players like Shak, always playing to the maximum extent possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible."
"I saw Kante coming to me, I got the ball, and I hit the gate for a while."
At the end of the first half of the match, the Chelsey team led with a score of 1-0, scored by a Belgian man named Eden Azar for 25 minutes.
The central Chelsey attacker, pass back to Mateo Kovacic, broke through the middle of the field half the Liverpool.
In the middle of the field, Kovacic played a single touch.
Then he passed the passage to Azar, who went out to the gate.
Azar overcame the defense, and from the left flank struck the gatekeeper of the Liverpool, Alice Becker, and struck a distant corner of the net.
Liverpool will meet the Napoleon team at the group stage of the League of Champions, and the match will take place at the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
"Chelsey" will play with the Videoton Club at the UEFA Euro League game, to be held on Thursday in London, also at 3 p.m.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunami that followed in Indonesia reached 832, reporting to the National Disaster Management Authority on Sunday morning.
Under the ruins of buildings destroyed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale, many people are reported to be left behind: the earthquake occurred on Friday and caused a tsunami of up to six meters high, reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official of the Office at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was overwhelmed by the rubble of the collapsed houses.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of causing a fatal stab wound to a woman.
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead County, Mercyside, and a murder investigation is under way.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at the Grayson Mews Complex on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among the locals.
"The investigation is at an initial stage, but I strongly ask everyone who was in the John Street area in Birkenhead, who might have watched or heard something suspicious, to contact us.
I also address everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have taken a video recorder, and ask for any information that might help the investigation.
An official of the police confirmed that the victim had resided in Birkenhead and her body had been found in the compound.
This afternoon, the alleged known victims arrived at the scene to ask their questions about where it was found this morning.
An investigation is under way, and the police are preparing to report the tragedy to the next of kin of the victim.
A taxi driver in the Grayson Mews complex tried to enter his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he learned what had happened, he lost his speech.
The people at home were told that they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One of the police officers told the tenant that the whole area was considered to be the scene of the crime.
One woman cried.
"What a horror!" she said.
At 2 p.m., two police buses arrived at the scene and another remained outside the fence.
A number of policemen have been set up inside the fence to monitor the apartment complex.
All who have any information are asked to send a personal message to @MerPolCC's Twitter account, call number 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 (case 247 of 30 September).
Kromwell's monument in front of the House of Parliament sparked a heated debate on the “census of history”
Cromwell's “eviction” would be a well-deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts of England by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Remembrance Society called Mr. Crick's proposal “a madness” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Remembrance Society, stated: “As part of the ongoing debate on the demolition of historic monuments, the question of Oliver Cromwell's statue in front of the Westminster Palace has inevitably arisen.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconic movement during the English civil wars.
Oliver Cromwell is probably suffering for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived forever before.
Sir William Hamo Tornicroft's grand statue of Cromwell's authorship reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historic achievements of a man whom many still consider to be worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case to be a monarchy.
Whether this view is historically accurate remains the subject of professional debate.
But we can be sure that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century had an impact on the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as Lord Protector are also to be commended and respected.
A Chinese farmer was killed by a killer pig.
In a market in southwest China, the farmer was the victim of a pig, reporting to the local media.
The victim's bloody body (the media mentions only his name, "Yuan") was found with a broken artery near a cliff in the Lupanyu district of Guizhou in southern China, as reported by the Morning Post Sunday.
Pig is preparing to inoculate pigs on a pork farm, May 30, 2005, Sinin County, Qinghai Province of China.
Yuan and his cousin came from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, his cousin found Yuan's dead body, and the door to the next porkyard was open.
There was a huge carnivore with blood on it.
In the course of the forensics, it was found that a 250-pound pig ate the farmer's death.
“My brother's legs were bleeding and maimed,” said Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the victim.
The surveillance video showed that Yuan had come to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the newspaper Evening News that the pig had been isolated in a separate box during the investigation in order to prevent further attacks.
It is reported that the Yuan family is negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the death of the farmer.
Swine attacks on people are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously traumatizing a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal hung a Wallian farmer to a tractor and let go, only fearful of a young wife.
In 2012, a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs, and, as a Canadian farmer told CBC News, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can affect their covert aggression as a trigger mechanism.
"Pigs of the game,
They're biting and very curious, but they don't want to hurt you.
You just need to instil in your animals a sense of measure and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rose will bring the rains to a significant part of the southwest of the United States
It is predicted that Hurricane Rosa is losing power by moving through a zone with cooler water to the north coast of Mexico.
However, over the next few days, it will bring storms and flooding to North Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York, the cyclone reached the 1st category with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The storm is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, heading east to the west coast of the United States.
On Monday, more than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico.
In the coming days, heavy rains are expected in the south-west as a result of the tropical humidity in the emerging low-pressure zone.
Sludges between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous flooding, dirt streams, and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, particularly in the south of the States of Nevada and Arizona, the high rate of precipitation can be 5 to 8 cm per hour due to high tropical humidity.
In some parts of the southwest US, mostly in most of Arizona, it is expected to be 5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall.
The risk of sudden rapid flooding due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains is not ruled out.
With the current risk of tropical rain, walking in the desert has serious consequences.
Libs can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunder can cause stormy winds to blow up clouds of dust.
With low-pressure zones on the shores of southern California, the storms will be erupted.
It's possible to drop up to 1.5 cm of rain, which can cause small dirt streams and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall since the start of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings in Arizona, there will be tropical rains that will spread to other territories by Monday night and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the rains will take place in four corners and will last until the evening of Wednesday.
In October, there will be sharp temperature swings throughout the United States, due to the low Arctic air temperature at relatively high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes this combination leads to severe temperature swings in a small area.
Such sharp temperature swings will be particularly evident in the central US on Sunday.
Between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa, there is a difference of about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
In most of the US central and eastern territories, warm weather is expected in early October, and the temperature will be as high as 27 degrees from the South Plains to the Northeast.
In New York on Tuesday, the air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast is very likely to have an unusually high temperature on the east coast of the United States by mid-October.
The Senate hearing in the case of Judge Brett Cavanaugh saw more than 20 million viewers
The testimony of Britta Cavanaugh and Christina Blazi Ford, who accused Cavanaugh of an attempted rape in the 1980s, held over 20 million viewers of six TV stations on Thursday.
The political stand-off over Cavanaugh's confirmation of the candidacy received an unexpected follow-up. On Friday, an urgent media report was made by Republican Jeff Flake stating that the charges against a lawyer should be investigated by the FBI within a week.
According to Ford at the Senate Law Committee hearings, she is “100%” confident that Cavanaugh was in a state of intoxication and tried to strip her at a school party.
Cavanaugh gave an emotional statement, saying that he was 100% sure it didn't.
According to the Nielsen research agency, more than 20.4 million spectators watched the debate on Friday.
The Agency took into account the average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data on the number of audiences of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen's ratings do not always take into account the viewers who watch TV at work.
By contrast, this is an average audience following the American football game in playoffs or the Oskar ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose hosts had been very supportive of Cavanaugh's appointment: the senate hearing, which lasted all day, had an average of 5.69 million viewers, reported by Nielsen.
The second is ABC, with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audition was 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, according to Nielsen.
The interest in the case has not diminished since the hearing.
There was a real drama with Jeff Flake on Friday.
After a senator from Arizona, considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Cavanaugh's candidacy, CNN and CBS were able to capture the camera, as on Friday morning, on his way to a meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake ran into a group of activists who had criticized the senator.
The whole world has seen him get a resentment from angry women on live CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," one of them said.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“For you is power, while so many women are powerless,” they tried to explain their position.
Flake replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and that he would speak on the subject at the committee meeting, and the elevator doors had closed, concealing the senator from all-embracing cameras.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Cavanaugh's candidacy for the post of judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all TV channels aired the meeting live.
But Flake put one condition in place: the FBI's investigation of the charges against the candidate by next week, as a democratic minority did.
Blake claims to have changed his mind because of the intervention of a friend, a senator from the Democrats, Chris Coons.
He made the final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Flake's decision had had an effect, as it was clear that the Republicans lacked the votes to confirm Cavanaugh without an investigation.
By decree of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses his critics of "political games" about the Brexit situation.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians criticizing her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow-party interests ahead of the public interest.
The British Prime Minister arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published on the same page as May, the former head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Brexit "Shot" plan, saying that he considered the introduction of customs duties between the United Kingdom and the EU to be "absolutely absurd."
Wade Sims' death in a gunfight: the police arrested Daemon Simpson on suspicion of murdering a forwarder at the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player playing for the University of Louisiana.
According to the Baton-Ruge Police, 20-year-old Daion Simpson was arrested and detained for second-degree murder.
The police released a video of a fight with Simms and Simpson, in which Simms lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, the regional CBS channel, the police found Simpson's DNA on the sunglasses found at the crime scene.
During the interview, Simpson admitted that he had fatally wounded Wade.
According to Advocate, the bond for Simpson was set at US$ 350,000.
The Coroner of the Eastern district of Baton Ruja released a pre-trial detention on Friday: the death was caused by a cross-cutting shot in the neck and head.
The Division thanks the Criminal Investigation Department of the State Police of Louisiana, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, the University of the South Police and the locals, who helped carry out the investigative activities that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleveva, Director of Sports, University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “good-faith work in catching a criminal.
Simms was only 20 years old.
The 2-metre forward was a native of Baton-Ruge; his father, Wayne, also played on the team of the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, Sims scored 5.6 points and averaged 2.6 rebounds per match.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying that the tragic death of Wade Simms had caused "shock" and "true grief" for all the players.
"That's what I've always been afraid of," he added.
The vulcan covered Mexico City's ashes
The Volcano Popocatepetl fell in ashes to the south of the capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention of Mexico recommended that the population should not approach the volcano: its crater had been active and had generated 183 steam and gas discharges in 24 hours.
According to the Centre, there was frequent rumbling and trembling in the vicinity of the volcano.
In some parts of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko, social media users published photos of frontal glass of cars covered with thin ashes.
After an earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which struck central Mexico in September 2017, geophysics recorded an increase in volcanic activity 72 km south-east of the capital.
The Volcano Popocatepetl (or, for its own, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police encounters with Catalan separatists in the run-up to the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a multi-thousand rally was held in Barcelona to mark the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which had split the country into two camps, and there had been clashes between the supporters of autonomy and the police, and six participants had been detained.
Police officers had dissuaded protesters of independence, while the latter, in black masks, had thrown eggs and powdered paint at the security guard, raising clouds of dark dust in the very center of Barcelona.
After the police put the truncheon in order to contain the crowd, the riots resumed with new force.
For a few hours, the supporters of independence chanted, "Let's not forget, let's not forget!", and their opponents said, "Live Spain!"
According to the local press, fourteen of the participants were slightly injured in the hospital.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was declared illegal by the Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for separatists, and a year later, tension persists in a region seeking sovereignty.
Catalonia voted with a huge margin to withdraw from Spain, but the appearance was low because the opponents of the exit largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, during the past year, almost 1,000 people had been injured in an attempt by the police to block the holding of a referendum at the country ' s polling stations in violent clashes.
On Friday, the separatists slept on the stated route of a demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration still took place, but it took a different route.
A 68-year-old electrician, Narcis Termes, who attended a secessionist rally in his wife's company, lamented that the hope of Catalonia's acquisition of sovereignty was becoming ever more frustrating.
“At last year, one of the most important events in our lives took place.
My parents weeped with joy when they had the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a state of arrogance,” he says.
In the recent December local elections, the Qatari parties that are in favour of secession from Spain won an important victory, albeit with a small severance, but this year their movement is losing its supporters, as many of the prominent leaders of the movement are either on the run or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pouch, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a police rally, said that the conflict was heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
He added: “The tension is exacerbating.”
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in regular elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government,” he says.
Londonderry: the car hit the house, all three of the co-defendants are under arrest.
One of the houses in London berry had been hit by a car on several occasions; the men in it, aged 33, 34 and 39, had been taken into custody.
The attack took place on Thursday, about 7.30 p.m. local time in the area of Ballingard Cressent.
As a result, the fire was damaged by the gate and the building itself, according to Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings.
There are reports that an onion shot might have been fired in the car.
Livingston's victory over Rangers thanks to Menga's clear goal
The first goal of Dolly Mengi was a guaranteed victory for the Livingstone team.
Thanks to the hit ball, "Livingstone" won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerrard, this is just the second defeat in 18 games.
The exact strike by Dolly Mengi equalized Gary Holt's team to the Hibernian Club in the score table, where they share second place.
The Gerrard Club was left without a win-win for this season of the Prime League, and is scheduled to meet with the leaders of the group, the Harts, who are behind the Rangers by eight points on Sunday.
On Thursday, the Rangers will be playing a League of Europe match with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vienna).
The Livingstone Club continues its win-win series in the Division, having won six games and not had a single loss since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's main coach.
Lost moments for "Livingston" in a fight with strong guests
Trainer Holt's caretakers had to keep the account from the start, and the Rangers clearly failed to cope with their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal of his weak attempt failed, and then Alan Litgow's defender, swinging too wide, failed to prevent the ball of Keigh Hulket from getting in the net.
The host allowed the Rangers to play in front of their defense line, relying on the dangerous moments when the game resumed.
That's how they missed that big goal.
The Rangers gave up the free shot, and Livingstone took the opportunity to deliver Declan Gallagher and Robinson to Menge, who scored out of central position.
By that time, Rangers had the advantage of owning the ball, but the protection of the host team was invincible, so the gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, was not concerned.
The second half continued in the same way, although Kelly still had to strike Alfredo Morelos.
Allan McGregor kicked the ball off Scott Pittman, and Litgoe made a big pitch out of the standard position.
Balls have been constantly hit by the Livingstone penalty, but all the attacks have been recorded, and the two penalty requirements, one for provoking Glenn Middleton's spare player and the other for the game, have not been met.
"Livingston's "Fenomenal" Game - Analysis
From BBC Scotland - Alasder Lamont, a report from the Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
A phenomenal game and an excellent score for the Livingstone team.
All the players were perfect, and they overcame all the expectations, continuing their climb to the football Olympics.
Their style of play and composition has not changed much since they got to the top of the rating line, and coach Holt's credit is that he's been mobilizing this team from the start.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Hulket was the head of the grandly organized defense, and Menga was holding Connor Goldson and Joe Warall back.
At the same time, the Rangers had no way of getting back to the beat.
Although they had a good playtime with coach Gerrard, this time they didn't live up to our expectations.
In the last few minutes of the match, they didn't have the right to own the ball, and they only managed to get the support of the host team once. The Rangers, down to the middle of the table, had a lot to think about.
Refrigeration of Erdogan during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast, the weather was beautiful, and both of the top were in a great mood.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish a relationship between the two NATO member countries, a visit already associated with some conflicts.
The heads of country failed to find an understanding of such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
He went to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented the 25 thousandth crowd from entering the mosque, but many of Erdoğan's supporters had been stationed nearby to see their president.
In the same place, the opponents of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to invite him to Germany.
The existence of radically conflicting views at the meeting reflects the ambivalent nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish origins extoll Erdoğan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford Road crash: crashing a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, the car ran into a cyclist who died at the scene.
An accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelin Street, a lively junction in the southeast of Depfort, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the paramedics who had arrived at the site tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without coming to his senses.
This is not the only fatality incident in the area: just a mile from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver ran off.
The London Police report that work is under way to identify the deceased and to inform the next of kin.
In the meantime, roads have been blocked at the scene and bus routes have been rerouted: motorists have been asked not to enter the area.
Insurgency in Long-Lartin prison: six policemen injured
According to the Long-Lartin administration, six policemen were injured during the riots in the men's high security prison.
In the Long-Lartin, Woostershire, men's maximum security prison, there have been riots since Sunday around 9:30 a.m. local time.
The Tornado Task Force was called to deal with the riots involving eight prisoners from the same wing.
Police officers had suffered minor damage to the soft tissue of the person and had received medical treatment on the ground.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained staff have been recruited to resolve the incident at the Long-Lartin Correctional Centre.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and that their preventive measure may be changed for a longer period.”
Long-Lartin is currently holding over 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been hospitalized by an attack on a prisoner.
And last October, the prison management was forced to engage special units to calm the raging prisoners who had thrown biljart balls at the wardens.
Hurricane Rose can flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Arizona rarely enters the area of the intense tropical cyclone, but this time it was “lucky”: early next week, Hurricane Rosa, after making a final leap, must pass over the desert of South West and bring with it the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service had already warned of the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and in the south and east of the state of Nevada, in south-east California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass a direct line over Phoenix on Tuesday and rain on Monday night.
The Bureau of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that “only a dozen tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within a 320 km radius from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 65 km from the border of Arizona.
According to the latest forecasts by the National Meteorological Service, it will fall from 5 to 10 cm of rainfall, reaching 15 cm on the Arizona Mogolon-Rim Plateau.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, which may fall up to 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, the rainfall can be as high as 10 cm.
For areas that are overwhelmed by storms, the rain caused by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, for the region has long suffered from drought.
While flooding may be a danger, the heavy rains can ease the dry season that does not take place in the South-West of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, there is at least a severe drought on more than 40 per cent of the Territory of Arizona (the second most severe),” web site web.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, a storm with a maximum speed of 137 km/h is 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at a rate of 19 km/h.
The storm landed in a zone with cooler water on the Pacific coast and thus lost power.
In the afternoon, the storm will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
In some parts of Mexico it is expected that there will be abundant flooding.
"On the ground from Lower California to the Northwest of Sonora, it can fall to 7 to 10 cm in rainfall, at 25 cm in space," reports the web site Weather.com.
Next, Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico, and in the early morning of Tuesday, it will reach the border with Arizona in the tropical cyclone category, from Arizona to the south of Utah by Tuesday night.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rose and its remains is the heavy rains in lower California, in the northwest of Sonora, and in the deserts of the southwest of the United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
It is expected that the rainfall will result in dangerous flooding, dirt streams in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Northon: four suspects in attempted murder were arrested
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was seriously stabbed and three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, about 4 a.m. on Saturday morning.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects, aged 17, 18 and 20, were arrested in the Radstock area, reporting to the Avon and Somerset County Police.
The police are looking for possible crime witnesses who have any video of the incident on their cell phone.
Donald Trump: "On Cavanaugh, all the hatred, all the anger of the Democrats"
“The voice for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally of his fellow members in Wiling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, during the process of approving Cavanaugh's nomination for a candidate, all the hatred, all the anger of the Democratic Party “grown off.
On Thursday, Cavanaugh testified at the U.S. Congress, categorically rejecting the charge of Christina Blazee Ford that he had sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago when both of them were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during her trial.
On Saturday, the U.S. president said that that day "the American people saw Cavanaugh's brilliant mind, class, and courage."
“The voice for Judge Cavanaugh's claim is a voice for one of the most prominent jurists of our time, with an unblemished state record,” the president announced to a crowd of his fellow Western Virginia.
In his speech, the President implicitly raised the issue of Cavanaugh's nomination, referring to the importance of the Republicans' being present for the elections to the Congress and the House of Representatives.
“The most important elections in our lives are only five weeks.
I'm not part of it, but I'm part of the race in a different way," he said.
“I wear like a burnt-out and fight for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task of “with all their power to resist us”.
According to the regulations, the first key vote in the Senate for the confirmation of Cavanaugh's candidacy is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, and the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party reported.
The earthquake in Indonesia has taken hundreds of lives, and the total number of casualties continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had lost their lives, and many had been taken away by huge waves that had taken over the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which had been hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims were hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in the city of Palu, and on Friday, at the end of the coast, waves of about six meters high, which swerved everything on their way and led to the instant death of many of the people present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7,5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was issued yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of fleeing to shelter immediately, and lost their lives,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority, reported at a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsuns didn't come one way, the water stream had machines, logs, whole houses, and the element had destroyed everything in its way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami had crossed the ocean at a rate of 497 km/h, and had hit the coast with all its might.
Some of them climbed the trees, saving their lives.
Some 16,700 locals were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palau.
Aerophobics of the Disaster Management Department show destroyed houses, shops, broken bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by an underground tremor.
A series of earthquakes took place in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The statement of the Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) states that the earthquake-induced energy release was about 200 times as high as that of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected, thanks to the geographical location of the city at the end of the long narrow Gulf.
Nugroho described the damage as “large-scale,” adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings; 540 people were injured, and 29 others were reported missing.
Nugroho added that the loss and destruction could be even more significant along the coast to 300 km from Pale, a site of Dungal, which was closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications from Dungal were “totally destroyed, no information was received”.
“Dongala region has more than 300,000 people,” reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers are already on their way to the disaster zone.
“A tragedy has occurred, but it is not the limit,” the report states.
On Saturday, the Authority was severely criticized because it did not report a tsunami on time in Palau, but the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
On social media, there's an amateur video in which a man on the top floor of the building screams at an impending tsunami, desperately trying to attract the attention of the people on the street.
In a few minutes, a wall of water will be on the shore, carrying whole houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
Earthquake and the tsunami have caused a major electrolysis defuse, which has made it very difficult for the services to escape in Palau.
From Jakarta and other cities, humanitarian military transport aircraft were flown, but the evacuees still lack food and basic supplies, and government sources report.
The airport was open for humanitarian assistance only; it will be closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Pala on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision donated safely from Dungal to Palau, where the staff found shelter in tarpaulins that had been broken down in the backyard of their office building, and said the Doséby of Sinai, on the way they had a horrendous picture of total destruction.
"They've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charities have begun to put in place humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many have complained that international NCBs have failed to reach Palau.
Indonesian law only allows the use of funding, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations once the site of the disaster has been declared to be a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is considered to be a local disaster,” reports Auliya Ariani, Spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares a natural disaster to be national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but so far the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Pala, friends and relatives of the missing still hope for their miraculous salvation, which will bring back the people's faith in the best.
A little boy who fell into the sewer was rescued on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers extracted a woman from the rubble of the building, who had spent two days there, near the dead body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, a national paraplanetry coach for Indonesia, trained two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian games in Indonesia.
Among the other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
“I am not the last person in this sport, and it is emotionally hard to survive,” he said.
Gendon remembers that when he learned of the collapse of Roa Roa's hotel from other paramedics in the next hours, he desperately tried to reach out to his colleagues in Palau on the beach festival.
However, his messages were shown with one gray check, not two blues.
“This means that no messages have been delivered,” he considers.
Steady theft of US$ 26,750 while servicing the ATM in Newport on Levi
On Friday morning, the intruders stole 26,750 dollars from the Brink's ATM in Newport on Levi, as reported in a press release by the Newport Police.
According to an investigator named Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armoured minibus took the cash from an ATM located in the entertainment complex and was about to refill it with new banknotes.
At that time, "Brink's employee ran off the back of the intruder" and hijacked a bag of banknotes to refuel the ATM.
According to witnesses to the incident, a number of suspects had escaped from the scene, but the police had not indicated the number of potential participants.
Citizens who have any information about these persons are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Ye.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter: “The person formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West had a pseudonym for a long time and even put it on the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news of this was in the run-up to Kanye's appearance in the "Saturday Night Live", where he plans to present his new album, "Yandhi".
Kanye West will act as co-leader in place of the singer Ariana, who has cancelled her participation due to “emotional feelings,” reports the author of the show.
West had previously stated that the pseudonym was not only a shortened version of his name, but also a religious one.
“Ye, the most common word in the Bible, means you, you,” West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with Big Boy.
"I mean, I'm you, I'm us.
At first it was Kanye, which means "the one," and now I'm just Ye, a reflection of all the good, bad, incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.
Kanye is not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deady, Pi Diddy, or just Diddy, asked this year to call himself Love ("love") or Braza Love ("Bruder Love" or "Bruder Love").
He, who spoke to West rapper JZ, also changed his name several times: with a defiance and no, capital letters or lower letters.
The President of Mexico solemnly pledges not to use military force against the civilian population
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico vowed never to resort to military force against the civilian population in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which led to a bloody confrontation.
On Saturday in Tlatelloco Square, President López Obrador promised to “never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On this site, on October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began that claimed the lives of 300 people, amidst growing left-wing student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also promised support to Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and to open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational prospects led young people directly to the criminal world.
The US needs to double the funding for the development of the AI.
China and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (III) should not be underestimated: the US should double its investment in its research, as Lee Kaifu, an ISI investor and entrepreneur, with experience at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
In the past, several U.S. ministries have made statements on the II, although the U.S. does not have a clear strategy for the development of II.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its aim is to be the first to innovate the AI by 2030.
“A doubling of the IE research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking forward to the next breakthrough in II,” says Lee.
The doubling of funding may double the chance that the next big I.I. will be made in the US, said Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intellect: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director General of the Synoviation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent IIs in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that outperformed the highest player in the American Othello, and then he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee referred to previous US government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge Defense Advance Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be to help find people with non-conventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants.
“Not China absorbs academic leaders, but corporations,” Li is convinced.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring a glove from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the US develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that Green Cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to scientists in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations make money available to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li claims.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense had set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, in which partners from industry and academia should be involved, and the White House had announced the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it is currently investing over $100 million a year in IE research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which was trying to set up the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any action in this regard for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country to “the Republic of North Macedonia”, which would allow for the resolution of a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is a province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments concluded an agreement based on a new name, but national opponents claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter turnout would be at a minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was as follows: “Do you support the membership of NATO and the EU, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia, should pay that price for joining organizations like the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievskaya, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament had stated that they would abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
A change of name will require a two-thirds majority of members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Yose Tanevski, a voter from the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumitz, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje House of Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene, splitting chairs in front of tents established by the citizens who are about to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and EU membership, but we want to unite with our high-headed, rather than surging the doors of the office,” says Kawadarkov.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-respect.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zayev said that membership of NATO would bring about investments in Macedonia, which was so much needed by that country, where the unemployment rate was more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favor, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zayev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive answer will be a “fundament of our prosperous future”.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would take part in the referendum, but that was lower than the required turnout.
Another interview conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel revealed that 57 per cent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of that number claimed to vote positively.
For the referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western Government since it came to power last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City is running around Briton's defense to score a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling killed Briton's defense, leading Manchester City to a victory with a score of 2:0 on Saturday at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored the goal for the 65th minute, it didn't seem to be a problem.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker was given a pass in the center of the field.
He rushed between the three Britons before breaking into open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He went over one defence counsel and overcame a number of others at the edge of the Briton penalty zone.
He then handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English attacker, while in the penalty zone, put Aguero's ball in one touch, which hit Briton's gatekeeper, Matthew Ryan, with his right foot in the right corner of the gateway.
“Aguero is having some leg problems,” said Coach Manchester City, Pep Guardiola, to the journalists.
"We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored the goal at the time."
But Sterling was the one who gave the Celestial Blues the initial advantage in the fight of the Prime League.
That goal was full for the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero won the ball, deep down in Briton's territory.
He gave a great cut-off on the left flank on Leroy Sana'a.
Sanae made a few touches before handing Sterling over to the long-distance pants.
The assailant "Heaven-Blue" punched the ball in the gate right before flying out of the field.
Manchester City fought with Hoffhenheim in the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 on the Rhine Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to take the glasses from Colorado Rockies
After the Washington Nationals got out of the playoffs, there was no reason to force the events.
But the insatiable Sherzer hopes to win the fight against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who are ahead of a single Los Angeles Dodgers game in the Western Division, have problems in playoffs.
The 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies won at least 7 or 8th place, but they still hope to secure the title in the first division.
“Although we play for nothing, at least we can hold our positions, knowing the immense importance of the Denver atmosphere in the presence of an audience and another team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the pitcher for Sunday, but the latest evidence suggests that Sherzer is likely to play this role.
Sherzer, who is about to go to the 34th game, threw the ball at the pitcher's playground on Thursday, and on Sunday, on his day off, he will be the pitcher.

Trump's running a race in West Virginia.
Referring to the importance of the Republican turnout in the interim elections, the President implicitly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Cavanaugh, the President's nomination to the Supreme Court.
“All that we did was at stake in November.
Five weeks left to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's very, very important. I don't run, though I'm really running around fighting for good candidates,' he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using all the necessary means, and we see abhorrentness and abhorrentness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to cross to get power and control, and that's what they want - power and control, but we're not gonna give it to them.
The Democrats, he claims, had the aim of “opposing and hindering.”
“And you've been watching it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “vilest, mean, mean, and lying.”
He referred to the Senate's Legal Committee, referring to the Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein, which caused loud calls from the Hall.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the contents of this document?
Um... um... what document?
No, no, the body language gave it away, I've never seen the body language so disprove the words."
The Labour Party is no longer a multi-minded organization.
It is not tolerant of those who express their views
When Momentum activists in my local party proposed a vote of distrust to me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of the members of Parliament from the Labour Party, who has not yet been told that we are not welcome for expressing our views.
A similar attitude to my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was expressed with determination against anti-Semiticism.
In my case, the vote of distrust was critical of me for dissenting Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, Europe — ironically, the issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham Eastern Labour Assembly was notified on Friday that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party, the evening meetings of the GC were like this.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not in line with many meetings, and the promise of a “more human and soft” policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
The fact that there are no differences of opinion in the Labour Party is becoming more and more evident, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the party ' s leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own began to expect me to change radically my views and take positions that I would never accept — whether national security or a single EU market.
Every time I speak in public — no matter what I say — there is a tirade of insults on social media that call for the annulment of the election, which denounces the centre's policy, or that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to me are still tending to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face daily a wave of sexual or racist attacks, but never retreat.
The most frustrating of this policy is the fact that this number of insults has become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “broad church,” and with every vote of distrust or change in the rules of choice, the party is becoming a party.
Over the past two years, I've received a lot of recommendations calling for me to sit down and cut my voice, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Ever since I joined the Laborists 32 years ago, as a student of the school, indignant at the disrespectful attitude of the Thatcher government, which has caused my school class to fall apart, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need them most, whether it be the work of a local deputy or a government minister.
I never hid my political views, nor did I do it in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misunderstand my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: my country is moving so hard to Brexit, which will guarantee economic, industrial and public losses, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I'd like to address is not Nottingham Modernum, but my constituents, whether or not they are laborers: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that any threat of annulment or political expediency will not prevent me from acting as I consider necessary in your interest.
Chris Lesley, MP for Nottingham East County
Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible "Er" comes first
Two late attempts may have misplaced the final result, but there is no doubt that the “Er” has earned a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Tennenth Prime League match.
Now they're heading the table, the only invincible team of tens.
After all, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as their ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merchi the right to be content.
“The whole time we've been tested for strength, and we're still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” Peter Merchy commented.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "To pay tribute to "Ear," they did better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fresher Climo led the "Er" forward, but the yellow card released for the game "Warriors" by Scotland's player, Rory Hughes, allowed Melrose to move forward, and Jason Buggott grasped the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased the break of the "Ear" from the penalty period before, right in the middle of the game, he scored a point, and then made a one-time attempt, making score 17-5 in favor of the "Ear".
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Buggot shortened the break to five points.
Then there was a long break due to a severe trauma to Ruarid Knott, who had been stretched, and after re-entry, the "Er" moved on with a try by Stafford McDowell, which was carried out by Klimo.
Acting Captain Blair McPherson then got the yellow card, and again Melrose forced the rivals to pay another player for the unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of a period of violent pressure.
However, the owners returned, and when Strawan Hutchinson got a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the line of the penalty line, MacPherson made a touchdown behind the coming moth "Er".
Climo realized the advantage, not stopping almost from the very second exit, after Kyle Rowe had been struck by David Armstrong and sent the extreme attacker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the landlords.
Star Still Game is about to start a new career in the restaurant business.
Star Still Game Ford Kieran is about to start work in the hotel industry, and it has become known that he was appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor performs the role of Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show that he writes to, and is filmed with a long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemfield.
Duoth announced that the coming 9th episode would be the last on the show, and it looks like Kirnan is planning to live after Craigslist.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmore Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although Scottish Sun's source hinted that Kirnan was planning to take part in the "blising restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The Sea of Ours": a land-locked Bolivia hopes that the Court will re-open the path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling a naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
The navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked with a slogan: “The sea is rightfully ours.
It is our duty to return it."
Throughout Bolivia, which is a land-locked country, the memory of the coastline lost in Chile's favor as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century over resources is still alive, and the desire to navigate again in the Pacific.
Those hopes may have been the most bold in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of an international court to be held on 1 October in the wake of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity, and a mental balance, and, of course, a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the high-screening process of the International Court of Justice throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile has a duty to negotiate for Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is waging a hard fight for re-election next year, is also thrilled to see the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
Some analysts believe, however, that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if so, it will make little difference.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands had no power to control Chilean territory and had already stated that it would have no effect on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was rendered only six months after the last arguments had been heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In the past four years, the Bolivian case has not progressed, but has been delayed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate says.
According to her, Morales' war rhetoric destroyed the last of Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
These two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagreed that the court's decision had been delivered too quickly.
Monday will provide Bolivia with “a unique opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit”, he argues.
Calzadilla also disagrees with the fact that Morales, still one of Latin American’s most popular presidents, uses the naval problem as a political leverage.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he claims.
“The Court's decision is an opportunity to make sure once again that we need to cross our past.”
North Korea states that there will be no nuclear disarmament until it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho states that his country will never destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri addressed the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments are coming as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of resuming stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore.
Ree claims that the dream that the long-term sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever put the North on its knees is utopia.
Washington fears the adoption of this declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps on disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But the scepticism that Pyongyang is taking seriously the abandonment of the arsenal, which the country may view as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris's fashion show shows the newest line of massive headdresses that promise to appear in the mass market, and they'll be worn right next to you.
If you want to add your hats to your collection or to fully protect yourself from the sun, there's no need to look for something else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual head-cleanings as part of their SS19 collection and blinded fashion week visitors in Paris.
This summer, very impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram's followers, and designers decided to send their stunning designs to the podium.
A different exemplar of Valentino: the head beige decorated with wide margins like feathers was painted on model heads.
Other massive accessories included precious watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples, but all of these head-colds are not designed to warm up their heads in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of bizarre masks, which had to be the eve of Halloween.
Many of these petal masks had their mouth shut, and they were more like Hannibal Lector's picture than the art from the coutures.
One was like underwater gear with pipes and sunglasses, and the other was a melting ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're lucky.
Mode critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of getting into mass sales, right to you.
The huge hats follow the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a two-foot wide field, all of which have been worn from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The Cult label, which released this very impractical hat, which won so much popularity on social media, produced and sent out another huge accessory on the podium, a straw beach bag, almost as big as the bathing suit that carries the bag.
An orange bag of burnt raffia with a white leather pen and a line of raffia became a vivid copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 fashion week in Paris.
Celebrist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: "I think big hats and beach bags will be on the market in the next summer, as the designer has made this kind of stuff, it would be very hard to ignore the demand for huge accessories.
John Edward: Languages are of great importance to the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools continue to have a tradition of brilliant education, as confirmed again in 2018: outstanding exams have shown individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools belong to the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 pupils are enrolled throughout Scotland, and seek to provide the highest level of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for further higher education, their chosen careers, and the status of the world's citizens.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the design and implementation of the individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you call on his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you speak to his heart.
This is a strong indication that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to have a relationship with and trust the citizens of other countries.
From the last exams of this year, we see that languages are in the lead in the league tables and have the highest scores in the independent school exams.
A total of 68 per cent of foreign-language students received the highest A rating.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of pupils had received “A” in Mandarin (Chinese language), while 72 per cent of students in German, 69 per cent of students in French and 63 per cent of students in Spanish had also received “A”.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are no doubt considered vital for children and young people in the future.
At present, language subjects enjoy the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill job vacancies were a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of profession a student chooses, if he learns a second language, in the future he will have a real advantage by learning another skill that will be of use to him for the rest of his life.
The ability to interact directly with people from other countries automatically offers a person who knows more than one language a competitive advantage.
According to a YouTube poll of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent did not speak well enough in the foreign language to support the conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit rate — 15 percent of the respondents speak it.
That's why investing in language education is so relevant right now.
The knowledge of several languages, particularly those of countries with emerging economies, would give children a better chance of finding a good job.
There is a wide range of languages in Scotland's schools that are taught, with each school having a different set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important to Britain in the light of the country's future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with a teaching staff whose members are experts in those languages.
Independent schools in Scotland seek to create an educational environment that will train children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this must be appropriately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages do need to be seen as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, ensuring the diversity and benefits of young people in Scotland.
Il faunt byen le faire.
John Edwards, Director, Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron debuts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The worrisome expectation of fans to see LeBron James perform for the first time at the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
"Lakers" coach Luke Walton announced that James would play a pre-season Sunday match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still have to figure out how long it's gonna take.
“More than one or less than forty-eight,” Walton replied on the official Lakers website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter of the Lakers, tweeted that James was likely to play a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season games on the Lakers chart.
“I do not need pre-season games to prepare for the season at this stage of my career,” the player answers.
Trump's election race in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of election meetings tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five scheduled meetings of Trump next week, including visiting friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on the candidate he had proposed for the post of the Chief Justice had been postponed, Trump was seeking support for the upcoming interim elections, since the Republicans risked losing control of the Congress if the vote was held in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wiling, West Virginia, will take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting with Western Virginia's voters online on live YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at this week's hearing for the nomination of his candidate, Brett Cavanaugh, to the position of the Chief Justice, and Trump's offer of this candidacy has led to a number of negative reactions, as Cavanaugh was charged with sexual harassment, and the vote to be held in the Senate will be postponed for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main aim of this action is to help the Republicans who are going to the November elections to step up the electoral momentum.
So President Trump's campaign is to get these five meetings, to be held next week, to help “energize the activities of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters writes.
“The control of the Congress is so important to his agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible, since we are entering a busy campaign season,” says the Trump campaign press secretary, who refused to be called, Reuters.
Today's action at Wesbanco Arena in Wilinga can attract supporters from "...Ohio and Pennsylvania, and the media in Pittsburgh," reports West Virginia Metro News.
This Saturday's visit to West Virginia is the second visit to the state in the last month, where it won an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's senator Patrick Morrisy, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“The fact that in order for Morrisy to get ahead of the poll competitors, the president has to come is not a good sign for Morris himself,” says Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia (reuters citation).
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. Congregation is ready to fight and has hope on Sunday for a couple's race
After three one-way sessions, the Saturday game, two-to-two, may have been exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The moving initiative is an exceptional fictional sporting concept, but it is the one that the players believe in, and it is particularly prominent in such competitions.
So who's in charge?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I guess it's a small initiative for us,” Jordan Spitt said.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and 12 more are at stake.
The Americans, in Spit's view, feel the wind in sails, and they have reason to keep the spirit high, not least because of the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and each can boast of three out of four.
Sleeping was constant from you to the green, but it was a personal example.
The victorious screams became louder as the round continued, putting the decisive ball in the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas gave up two by two.
His blow, which gave them a victory in the game on the 15th hole, was met by a similar scream, one of the ones that speaks of his belief in a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together and focus only on our own game,” commented Spit.
That's all the players have left.
Walk through 18 holes and become victors.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are indisputably in the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe beat four out of four, and they don't seem to know the wrongs.
Moliwood was the only couple that didn't pick up the goddess on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the goddess on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and, again, Friday morning.
This series, and the way their energy seems to be circulating between them and violent fans, builds on the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the horizon of the "Le Golf National" field, there will be no more famous player who anchors Europe's potential victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It'd be great if both were on different holes at the same time.
But it is too early to talk about Europe’s glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quick to kill Sergio Garcia, the four-ball morning hero when he was in a couple with Alex Noren.
The boggs and the two double bogs on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swedish pit, from which they were never able to get out.
So on Sunday, no one's gonna help you get out of your pit.
It's so exciting to watch a four-ball game and a four-player game because of the interaction between the couples, the tips that they're sharing, and who deliberately keep quiet, and how the strategy can change in a moment.
So far, Europe has played better as a team, and has made significant headway on the last day, but this session has also shown that the U.S. team has the strength to fight, which some, particularly in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with 10-6
Europe will have a significant advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the completion of the four-ball and four-ball Saturdays with the top 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired duet Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against the two victories of the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the bill to "Le Golf National" to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wants to return the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the error-permitted American team in the morning four-ball games, winning the 3-1 score.
The US had more resistance in the fours, winning two matches, but had failed to narrow the gap in the account.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points out of the 12 Sundays to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second couple to win four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
When they beat Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they then made a great team to win the fallen Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechemo with even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who had completed two Saturdays, had splashes, but he now lost 19 of the 29 games in four, and the four in seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested before the four-ball game of the morning, returned to Henrik Stanson's four-year-old partner, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cap, with a score of 2/1, ranked first and third in the world.
For Europe, the game was not an easy and pleasant walk by a refreshing day southwest of Paris.
Made by the three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points served as a guide for Americans.
They won a strong 2/1 victory over the Spaniards, John Ram and Ian Polter, in a four-ball game, and later returned to beat Polter and Rory McElroy with a 4/3 score in fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team got out of a four-point gap, coming out alone, given that Ferrick's team, as masters, had to play a single game to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, the counterattack looks like it's out of line on Sunday.
North Korea says that “categorically” will not be disarmed unilaterally without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said to the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions had increased the distrust of the United States and that his country would never give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under any circumstances.
Ri Young-ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial goodwill” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear site, and the commitment not to build up nuclear weapons stockpiles or develop nuclear technologies.
“But we don't see a symmetrical reaction from the US,” he said.
“Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to take action on disarmament unilaterally.”
While Ri echoed North Korean complaints of Washington's “phased” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement was important in the sense that it had not rejected unilateral denuclearization without control, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong-Eun and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; at that time Kim promised to start a movement towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea is trying to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States states that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls for the relaxation of strong international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US insists that “first denuclearization must take place” and increases the level of pressure through sanctions for the enforcement of its purpose, and even opposes “the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri says.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is the utopian dream of people who don't know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions reinforce our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae In over the past five months and added: “Had South Korea, rather than the US, been a party to the issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been so stalled.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year when he said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s missile target on the US mainland was inevitable after the “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim the “suicide missile.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to “make complete destruction” of North Korea last year, commended Kim for his courage to take action on disarmament, but said that much remained to be done, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that it had no time frame for the process: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue to be active and mandatory until we see full, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in an effort to cut off the financing of Pyongyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly Summit and announced after the meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second Summit.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea had condemned him for “bang demands”.
North Korea promised, at a meeting with Moon this month, to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex, should the United States take appropriate measures.
According to him, Kim told him that the “corresponding measures” he was referring to were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest in special classes
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, helped all primary students to learn to sleep more and to combat the chauvinist culture of constant caffeine use in order to stay awake “nights through.
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brighham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first in the United States.
After his opening, he was aroused by the idea of introducing such a course, giving a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on the learning process.
"At the end of my presentation, a girl came to me and said, 'I'm sorry I didn't find out until I'm about to finish my studies.'
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which was first offered to students this year, shows how a healthy sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic achievement, and how it improves the general well-being of the individual.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the University's Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after it had been determined that students had serious sleep deficiencies during the school week.
The class lasts one hour, and the students perform a number of interactive tasks.
One section of the class offers an image of a dorm room, where students, by clicking on cups, curtains, simulators, and books, learn how each of these actions and the substances — coffee, light, which causes a lack of sleep — affect sports results, and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants learn how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The online campus map prompts participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behaviour of the students at once.
But we believe that they have a right to know, like any other person has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health,” added Professor Chesler.
He said that a false sense of pride for being able to “smell all night” is still common, and modern technology, as is the growing pressure on students, means that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
According to him, enough sleep of good quality is the student's “secret weapon” to deal with stress, nervous exhaustion, and anxiety, and even to deal with overweight, as underslapening puts the brain in a mode of hunger, making it constantly starve.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler to develop a course by attending a class last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to distribute this information all over the campus.
He hoped that the next step was to ask all graduate students to attend a similar curriculum before entering a competitive school.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students set up an alarm to warn them that they should go to bed and wake up, and that they remember the harmful effects of the “blue light” produced by electronic screens and LED lamps, which interfere with human bioethics and lead to problems of sleep.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: Hall Menga wins the Gerrard team
The Rangers experienced another unfortunate retreat, as the goal of Dolly Meng led the unassembled team of Stephen Gerrard to a 1-0 loss in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team was hoping to win their first 4-1 victory in St. Johnston in February, but the Gary Holt team only defeated Gerrard of the 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving a light win to the Harts team, the Scottish Prime League leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who had lost their temper, did not seem to plan to level the score.
While Rangers has now moved to number six, Livingstone has moved to number three, and only Hibernian has given way to the ratio of beaten heads.
And Rangers may have additional problems after Liner Judge Kalum Spence had to heal the head wound after an object had been thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight replacements for the team that went through "Ear" to the semi-finals for the Scots League Cup.
Holt, in turn, went with the same strategy as Livy 11, which widened the gap with the Harts last week, and he would be glad to see how his well-stressed members had put the opponents down at every step.
The Rangers may have been led in the possession of the sword, but Livingstone was pressed much more when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to score a goal in just two minutes, when the first transfer to Meng Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the semi-defense took the chance.
Keegan Jacobs struck Captain Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, was only able to send the ball to the back of his pants.
The Rangers had intercepted control, but in the last third, there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was sure he was supposed to strike the penalty for 45 minutes when he and Stephen Lawless ran into each other, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept the Colombian statement.
The Rangers had only hit two in the first half, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about the hit by Lassan Coolibaly's head, and the weak hit by Ovi Ejaria.
Though Livy's first goal, full of 34 minutes, may not be in line with the game, no one can deny that they have earned it exclusively by their own work.
But again, Rangers failed to cope with the Jacobs game from a standard position.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried hard to get the ball to Meng for completion.
Gerrard began to act during the break when he switched the Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and that replacement almost immediately produced the result when the extreme quarterback gave pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line to intercept.
But Livingstone continued to involve the guests in a game they were planning to play with Litgow and Hulkett, constantly making long shows.
Holt's team was trying to expand the break-out in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgoe gave the show off the corner of the field.
The reserve player, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a penalty strike after he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page of our almanac "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
As one of the foundations of science, Geiger's meter was also one of the foundations of a popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film "Colocola Coronado", with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who seem to be different from scientists, in the main roles:
Man: "What the hell is this thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's meter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the effect of atoms caused by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Here, I can hear you right now!"
He died in 1945 before his 63th birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
A new anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" abnormally growing cells and kill them
Part of the treatment of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to detect abnormal cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and to change them in laboratory settings
As a result of this change, cells have the ability to “see” the type of protein that is common to many cancers, and then the cells have to be reintroduced.
The test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One of the patients who had been injected with the vaccine and whose immune system had learned to detect abnormal cells, ovarian cancer had been in remission for over 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory environment, after which the modified cells can “see” HER2 proteins that are common to many cancers, and then re-introduce the modified cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzoofski, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Bethshad, Maryland, states: “The results we have received suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzoofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.
A similar method was successfully used in the treatment of leukaemia, which was to remove the immune cells from the patients and to “teach them” how to affect the cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in the MAGA cap after his appearance at SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was in the studio during a Saturday concert, at which he spoke in defence of US President Donald Trump, claiming that he would resume his position in 2020.
After performing his third song, "The City Ghost", which he put on the cap "Make America Great Again", the performer gave a speech against the Democrats and supported Trump.
"Very often I talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," the performer said.
SNL made a mock-up show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on Christina Blacey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
There was no sign on TV of the crowd's resentment over West's speech, but the video was uploaded on social media by a comedian Chris Rock.
Now it's not clear if Rock was trying to make West laugh.
In addition, West complained to the public that his hat had been mocked behind the scenes.
"They've been messing with me behind the stage.
They say don't come out in that hat.
They're really messing with me!
Washington Examiner quoted him as saying, "And they also said that my position was not cool."
West continues, "Do you want to know what's not cool? Put on a superman's cape so no one can tell you what to do? Do you want the world to continue to develop?
Then you need love."
His comments at least twice drew the attention of the audience, the members of the SNL cast seemed to be confused, and a man said to the magazine, "The whole studio is in silence."
Westa was invited at the last moment to replace the singer Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by the Westom song "I Love it" in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest people: SERVANT TO SUPPORT MIXTURE."
Karen Hunter's talk show host tweeted that West was just "who he is, and that's absolutely great."
“However, I do not want to support anyone (buying his music, dress, or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my view, shares and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us,' she said.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the trail of Diddie, also known as Puff Duddy, Puffy, and Pi Diddy.
His co-workers, the rapper Snoop Dog, had the name Snoop Lyon, and another example is, of course, an artist who had recently become a legend, the Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted murder charge for scissors at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of stab wounds in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhakamor, as reported by the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of Justice on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The Star of the Game of Thrones, Keith Harington, is attacking a toxic mask.
Keith Harington is known for his role as the swinging sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy show HBO "The Game of Thrones".
However, a 31-year-old actor recently critically criticized the stereotype of a hero-macho, saying that such characters often inspire young people to think that to be respected, you must be brutal.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that he believed that “something went wrong” and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who had recently married his fellow film "The Game of Thrones", Rose Lesley, who was his age, admitted that he was "incredibly passionate" about the problem.
“I take this question very seriously: where are we wrong about the perception of masculinity?”, asks the actor.
"What do we teach young people that we have such a problem today? "
Whale believes that TV can be partly responsible for this exploding toxic masculinity because of too muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is inborn and what is acquired?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they should only show one particular aspect of masculinity?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because today with young people, something is really wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in any of the spells or sequels of the Game of Thrones after the show ended next summer, saying that he had "let go of the battles and the horses."
As of November, Keith will play a major role in the re-enacting "The True West" by Sam Shepard, who talks about the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believed that meeting Rose's wife was the best finale of the Game of Thrones for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my life,” the actor says.
Rose played the Player, the subject of the passion of the character Keith John Snow in a Phenthesian series awarded to Emmy's award.
The couple celebrated a wedding in June 2018 at the Leslie Family Manor in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were recorded.
In the vast majority of new cases, sexually transmitted diseases reflect a change in trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV infections was almost zero in this way, and Chinese health representatives said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 every year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997 but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that, due to the country ' s conservative values, 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to the lack of protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters disproves the information about the leak of information from the Republican senators, complaining of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, rejected charges on Saturday that one of her employees had posted personal information to three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia of Lawmakers.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the claims were forged by ultra-right experts and websites.
“Little, lies, and even more vile lies,” Waters tweets.
It is reported that the published information includes home addresses and telephone numbers of US senators, Lindsey Graham, South California, Mike Lee, and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information was made available on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill at a hearing before the Senate Commission on Sexual Harassment Charges against a candidate for the Supreme Court of Britta Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators interviewed Cavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identified the source of the messages was linked to Waters' office, and released information about Waters' employees, reports Hill.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false,” Waters claims.
“A member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these frauds, was in no way responsible for the loss of that information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a complete lie."
Waters' statement prompted online criticism, including by former White House Spokesman Ari Fleisher.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleicher writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for work in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be mad?
You don't have to justify yourself either.
And you don't have to look at the motives of the prosecutors either.
We need to stay calm and cool.
Fleiser seemed to compare Waters' reaction to criticizing the Democrats against Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters' place in the interim elections, also made his point on Twitter.
“If it's true, it's very important,” he writes.
In his statement, Waters writes that her office warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these frauds.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are found,” she writes, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions that can be destructive and dangerous to all of my employees.”
Johnny English hits again - a weak mockery of Rowan Atkinson's spy
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film that in one way or another features Britain; this is also true of the new "Agent Johnny English", a parody spy franchise that started in 2003 and continued in 2011 with "Agent Johnny English: Rebooting".
Will the self-image picture with the "we're all shit" label become a new national export attempt?
In any case, Johnny English's blind-eyed profane with a rubber face got his right to chaos for the second time — his name is the most explicit hint of being a wide-screened comical creature designed for a non-English movie audience.
The hero, of course, is a dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim for a glamorous smoothie, got a bit of Clouseau, Mr. Bean's traits, and a portion of this guy, who put one single note in the Chariots of Fire tune in London in 2012, at the opening of the Olympics.
Originally, the character was formed on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, in which the hero left a complete chaos.
There is one or two good moments in this last edition of the JE.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the blades popped on his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift to the physical execution of comedy scenes, but humor itself seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because “serious” films like Agent 007 and “Mission Impossible” are now confidently offering comedy as an element.
It feels like humor is for children, not for adults, and for me, Johnny English's bizarre evils are not as ingenious and relevant as Atkinson's jokes in Mr. Bean's films.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated a top-secret British spy network, uncovering the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of a duty agent, Kevin Eldon, here, unfortunately, had an episodic role.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, a pompous and persuasive figure already suffering from huge political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best for the character Quasi-Teresa-May, but there's nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors tell her that, since every active spy was compromised, she will have to remove someone from retirement.
And there's the clumsy Johnny English himself, who is now a schoolteacher at some fancy place, but also gives informal lessons on secret operations: there's a few good jokes here, because English offers the skills of a "rock" spy academy.
English is going back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his ex-fashioned buddy Buff, who is playing by Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man under the command of a submarine, the role of a “jolly hockey club” in which Vicki Pepperdin is lost a little.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game because Her Majesty's Secret Service has made terrible mistakes, and they face a beautiful, fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletova, in the performance of Olga Curilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire, who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the ominous Jason Volta, who Jake Lacey is playing.
Inglish and Buff are starting their odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on the luxurious yacht of Volt; Inglish is creating anarchy, trying to use the garnish of virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volt's home.
All of these scenes are, of course, a sweet and fancy fiction, but there's something very childish about all of this.
Well, it's a very moderate thing.
And, like the other films of Johnny English, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that is really commensurate with his talent?
Laborers deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the British working week to four days for a five-day wage.
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, is about to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but pay in five days.
The party is said to want the company's managers to pay off the savings generated by the revolution in artificial intelligence by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow staff to enjoy three days off for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea was “incorporated” in the party's economic agenda and would help the country's population to become part of the workforce.
The Trade Union Congress had approved a four-day working week to enable workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A high-level source of the Labour Party said The Sunday Times: It is expected that the policy review will be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is our goal, which is in line with the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy to the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its campaign in 2017.
However, this desire is currently not endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party's policy and is not considered by the party.”
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to focus his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to rip off the power of “faceless directors” and “suppliers” of the community.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current water canal shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour Government may make “deducts” on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the board of directors of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of private sector capital to workers who would be able to receive an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lyndsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes," if the FBI's investigation of Cavanaugh can change their mind.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the post of Chief Justice for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the findings of the agency can prompt any of the Republican senators to support Cavanaugh.
In an interview on Sunday, a 60-minute correspondent, Scott Pellley, interviewed the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find something to make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," JFK replied.
“When I went to the meeting, I said I was talking to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and this information popped up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His answer was firm, clear and clear.
But Graham's opinion in the vote remained firm.
“I have made a firm determination about Brett Cavanaugh, and my view can only be changed by arguments that are comparable to dynamite,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I know for sure is that Brett strongly denied all of it," he added, "to Christina Blacey Ford.
“No one she called as a witness was able to corroborate these facts either.
It's been 36 years.
And I didn't see anything new about it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event in which an impressive starry, with an equally impressive mission, is the end of global poverty.
For the seventh year of the World's Citizens' Festival, as tens of thousands of people are flowing to the big lawn of Central Park, but not just to enjoy the performances of performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendez, and to present the real goal of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a follow-up to the global anti-poverty project being carried out by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you're not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to volunteer or send an e-mail to the world's leader, make a phone call or do any other or other significant action to help raise awareness of your goal of putting an end to poverty.
But how successful was the World Citizens' Festival in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people free to attend a concert really convince fellow citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” when people believe that they are making real changes by signing an online petition or tweeting messages?
The organizers of the Global Citizen claim that, since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been recorded at the festival by its supporters, who pursue many different goals.
It is mentioned that, as a result of this action, world leaders have pledged more than $37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements that had been made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided directly to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is the Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children to realize their full potential” promised to Rwanda $35 million to help put an end to undernourishment in the district, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments, and Global Cityens, such as you, we can do social injustices to the undernutrition of past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the “Food Force” project, which would cover 5 million women and children through activities to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival's website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The organizers of the Global Citizen say, "This is going to be a long and hard way to trip and fall from time to time.
But, as in the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardy B, Jeanelle Mone, are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, with Deborah-Lee Fernez and Hugh Jackman as its lead.
The US can use the Navy for “blocks” to prevent the export of Russian energy: the Minister of the Interior
US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has said that Washington can use its navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy the same way they do in Eastern Europe, in the south of Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this problem.
“The United States, together with our navy, has the opportunity to ensure the opening up of the sea lanes and, if necessary, the blockade to keep their energy out of the market,” the Minister says.
Zinke reached out to an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that views itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He next compares Washington’s approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is the more or less effective use and replacement of fuel,” states the minister, calling Russia a “one-trick,” whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made in connection with the Trump administration ' s intention to increase the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump’s officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “incorrect” Northflow-2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “minder” in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar North Flow-2 project, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s violent resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“Emphasizing that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers,” said the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with the US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The US position led to a negative reaction by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the Federation of the German Industry (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third state interferes with our energy supply, it poses a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of the German Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts will carefully explore the possibility of a presidential election in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced on Saturday that he would carefully consider the possibility of running for president after the interim election.
At a meeting of the City Duma in Holioke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider taking part in the race.
“The time has come for the women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and it takes a woman up there,” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will give careful consideration to the possibility of running for president.”
Warren so appreciated the work of President Donald Trump during the meeting: “This district will lead in the wrong direction.”
“I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump and his candidate for the position of Chief Justice Brett Cavanaugh.
In his Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before we go to the polls."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of the voters themselves, Warren, do not think that she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies, fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not run.
By contrast, 32 per cent of the respondents supported her plans.
The poll showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known Democrat names that were discussed in the context of the 2020 vision include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden claims to make a formal decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin told me about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump's constituents.
Track Palin, 26, joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is going through the same thing as other families who have suffered PTSD-related injuries, and our soldiers are coming back with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a “eye-in-the-eye” and said of her son and other war veterans: “They're already coming back with other, burnt, wondering if the same respect is shown to their comrades, soldiers, pilots, and any other military that they have given to their country.”
Trak Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasil, Alaska, and charged with family violence against a woman, interceding to the situation of violence and the possession of weapons in a state of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wasilah Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and D.C. support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, which prohibits shelter for victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts filed an analytical note in Washington on Friday by a court consultant on support for the asylum-seeker challenging the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons, who are members of a criminal group,” ill-treated her, but on 20 July the U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who support Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The U.S. new asylum policy overturned the decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Racine, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “needs decades of application of State, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires all applications for asylum to be heard on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle,” states the report of the court counsel.
Lawyers also claim that the policy against immigrant entry is detrimental to the US economy, emphasizing that it is this category of citizens that is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labour”.
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sashnes, ordered the immigration judges no longer to offer safe haven to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“The shelter will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or for reasons of political opinion,” Sashnes said in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument was never meant to address all the problems, even the most serious ones that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palau: the number of deaths doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more difficult.
"It's very difficult," says a 35-year-old mom named Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palau.
“Emergency is bringing the wounded in every minute.
Clean water is in huge deficits.
People go back to their broken homes, dig in wet stuff, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people had been injured, and hospitals affected by an earthquake of 7.5 were overburdened.
Some of the wounded, including Movie Harris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, rested near the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated in the open air because they had to leave the premises because of the continued strong blows.
He's crying, remembering how a terrible earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor that he was filming with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was strung into the rubble of the wall, ” tells Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, and then there was silence.

I hope they've escaped, and they're all right now.
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “attacks” carried out through “advertising”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a daily American magazine on the mutual benefit of US-China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to a fee-paying addition to Des Moins Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in the state of Iowa, accusing China of attempting to interfere in the US Congress elections to be held on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections is a confirmation of the fact that US officials have told Reuters: a new phase is under way in Washington's ever-growing campaign of pressure on China.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to advert to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are in a state of escalation of the trade war, which has led to the equalization of import tariffs for their countries.
China’s response rate at the start of the trade war was to strike down exporters in states like Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claims that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers, and business.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in Sunday's magazine Des Moins Register, “now doubles this harassment by posting propaganda in our own free press.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is making use of the American tradition of free speech and free press, paying and posting ads at Des Moins Register,” writes Branstad.
“But in the newspaper kiosks here in the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices, and you will not see the true diversity of views that the Chinese might learn about China’s worrying economic policy, since the local media is under the strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers had “smartly shook off” the offer to publish the article, although it did not give the exact title.
Analysts warn: Cavanaugh divisive Republicans repel women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans choose to stay away and defend the candidacy of Supreme Justice Brett Cavanaugh despite a number of allegations of sexual violence, warning that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, that may affect the upcoming interim elections.
Emotions around the situation have become extreme, and most Republicans have officially declared that they want to continue voting.
You can't go back to such things later, ” writes Grant Rier, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that the last-minute attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI will be enough to calm the angry voters.
“The women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Nour Front" in front of the Senate, when the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to present Cavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blacie Ford's testimony, reported to Mick.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the limit,” said a non-partisan politician, Stu Rotenberg, on the news website.
“People say that the situation is already bad enough, and it's true.
But it can get worse, especially in terms of female voters in the suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, while disliked the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford publicly testified against a candidate for the position of Chief Justice, accusing him of sexual harassment, the analysts assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the nomination, that action might trigger a retaliatory reaction.
“This is already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not just about the vote in the committee or the final vote, or whether Cavanaugh sat on the bench, but how the Republicans deal with it, as they do,” says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, a news channel.
Still, the Americans seem to be a bit divided on the question of who to believe, ford or Cavanaugh, and a little bit more on the side of the latter.
A new YouTube poll shows that 41 percent of the respondents believe ford's testimony accurately or most likely, while 35 percent say that they believe Cavanaugh accurately or most likely.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Cavanaugh is likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same thing about Ford.
At the insistence of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's charges, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Law Committee that Cavanaugh, in a state of intoxication, had attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the position of Chief Justice showed her his genitals at the party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, it was a joke that the goal of Inrupt was to gain “peaceful rule.”
"We have to do it now," he says about his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses the Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data repository" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, cases, as well as a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional data tools.
The application works in the same way as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all of which can be used in the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data repository is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “individual empowerment through data”.
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the Inrupt idea is that the company has provided resources, processes and appropriate skills to make the Solid available to all.
At present, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of state developers with whom the project is under contract, and a volunteer programmer community.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether his companies should make major changes that would make all of their business models completely change overnight.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In his post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee's voice has sounded quite powerful in the debate about online neutrality.
Even by launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee says.
Bernard Vann: A minister of worship awarded by the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one warrior priest was awarded the Cross of Victoria during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on September 29, 1918 for participating in the attack on Bellenglis and Løqurs.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
The monument to this event was solemnly presented by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vanne, said that it was “very symbolical” that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vanne conducted his battalion through the St. Canten Canal “in a very dense mist and under the heavy fire of the gun and machine-guns.”
Later, he rushed into the line of fire and “with the greatest courage” led the group forward, and then threw a field gun with one hand, killing three soldiers of the unit.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, a 72-year-old grandson of the hero, said that “he would not have been able to do the same heroicly, but it's depressing.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vanne, also laid a wreath at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Vanne said that “it is a great honour for him to take part in the parade” and added that “the value of a true hero is backed up by the support that will be given by many people.”
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they showed them the pig Peppa.
Imagine you didn't sleep all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you weren't allowed to see the main event.
San José's table contained 13 battles, including six of the main program's battles, and the fights were aired live all night on Channel 5 of British Television.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, the British fans were stunned to see Peppa's Pig on screen.
Some fans were not impressed at all, since they hadn't slept till morning precisely to watch the fights.
One of the Twitter fans called this a change in the show to a children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke."
“The state decreed that at 6 a.m. the content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to children's programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President Bellator for Marketing and Communication, when he was asked why.
"Yes, "Pep's Pig."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said that they were planning to set up a schedule so that in the future the fights could also be seen by British viewers.
“As far as re-showing is concerned, I think we can solve this,” says Coker.
"But it's Sunday, 6:00 a.m., and we can't solve this by Sunday, and it's gonna be Monday for them.
But we'll do our best.
Trust me, when the broadcast was changed, there was a lot of text messages, and all of them were not friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, and we thought it was some sort of technical failure.
Turns out, no, it was a matter of national importance.
I promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to cut the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase that number, but it's too much.
Yeah, it didn't work out well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was incompetent because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic diver, Tom Daly, says that he grew up feeling the worst because of his sexuality, but that's what got him motivated to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that "not all like him" until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first program, Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had spoken about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that the victory at the Olympics had become less of a concern to him after he had had a baby.
The permanent host of Kirsty Young's multi-year show took a few months' leave due to illness.
Daily, who was the main guest in the Laverne program, said that he felt “negligent than any of his peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to the community, both for boys and for girls.
He says: “To date, these feelings of impoverishment and inadmissibility have been real, but they have given me strength, and I have been able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something" so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexual orientation.
The double bronze Olympic Medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and, in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had expressed his opinion because he was lucky to be able to live an open life, with no consequences, and wanted to give others hope.
A three-time world champion said that the feelings for a man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 "was taken by surprise.
Last year, Daly married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“If there is so much going on in your life at this young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it is hard to find a peer who has the same radically contrasting experience in life.
The couple became parents in June, and they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daly said that "all his world view" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about "I need to win a gold medal," says the sporter.
"But you know what, there are more important things than the golden Olympic medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daily said that his father didn't want to accept his death, and one of his last requests was tickets to the first row at the London 2012 competition.
"I couldn't say to him, "Daddy, you're not gonna be there anymore, and you can't sit in the front row," says Daley.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he actually stopped breathing that I finally realized that he was not invincible,” says the sporter.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life -- diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, no better feeling," he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song, Proud by Heather Small, which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes him so much.

Michaelson, not in uniform, spent this Saturday Rider Cup on the bench
American Phil Miquelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to pick up the uniform to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Michaelson, who played the biennal for the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furic to the bench on Saturday for four balls and four.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five - time big winner shared his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of correcting what was bothering him.
Never had the most direct blow, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old sporter is not the perfect candidate for the hard track Le Golf National, where a long raft usually punishes for the wrong blows.
And if the course in itself is not quite frightening enough, Michaelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, will meet with the exact British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined with the newest Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12 singles make a big start, the Michaelson match can be decisive.
Ferrick expressed confidence in his partner, although he might have said something else.
“He fully understood the role assigned to him today, clapped me on the back, hugged me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow,” said Feriq.
"He's pretty confident, too.
He's a walking Hall of Fame, and he's done so much for these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with all of us."
On Sunday, Michaelson will break Nick Foldo's record for the number of games in the Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never corresponded to the heights of his individual record.
Michaelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven no-ones, even though Ferrick said that his presence was of great benefit to the team.
“He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to bully people, and he's a great guy,” he explained.
"I think the young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the great advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows in his experience that significant single-level leadership in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unwelcome side.
Dutchman debuted in 1997 in Walderram, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but overcame the finish line just a bit ahead of the margin, winning 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Walderram; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but just so far,” said Bjorn, who had been photographed in the 2018 class, winning the Le Golf National field with an score of 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday, resulting in an score of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and to the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you'll be on the full.
Go and do it right.
As long as the score is not on the board, it's not over.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I was not silent, focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we already know that what we're up against is the world's greatest players.
Bjorn added: “I would never have outdone myself.
We'll have a different test tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual talks start, and that's a different thing.
It's always nice to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you're experiencing all your strength as a professional golfer.
This is the idea that we need to inculcate in the players in order to be able to do the whole thing tomorrow.
Now the partner stays behind, and he too must do his best.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Ferrick, believes that his individual players will perform better than with partners, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Ferrick himself went all the way in the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he was finally lost when Europe held "The Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to finish it all as quickly as in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves in the same direction, it puts great pressure on the middle of the match.
We have properly designed our plan for the game and set up the guys as we thought was right, you know? Tomorrow we'll try to do a miracle."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McElroy in the top-mast with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ayana Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I have chosen this group of guys, and in that order, because I think that this way they will cover all possible shortcomings,” Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of a new German warship has been rescheduled
The newest frigate of the German Navy was due to be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen at least next year due to the failure of systems and the lavinic increase in value, reports the local media.
The entry into operation of the Rainland-Palatinate, the main ship of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military representative.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that had arisen since the shipment had complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aged Frigates of the Bremen class.
To the best of their knowledge, they will have a powerful gun, a host of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some of the “steals” technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods — the possibility of the deployment of the most recent frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of the entry into service means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will be obsolete by the time they become operational, notes Die Zeit.
The malignant F125 fell into the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the ship's builder after delivery.
Little was known of the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “software and hardware defects” that made a warship useless when used in combat.
Inadequacies in the software were particularly critical, since the Baden-Württemberg class would be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers — only half the workforce in the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy, reducing its productivity and limiting the ability of the Navy to implement future updates.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective equipment, the cost of the whole project, including the training of the team, is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering Euro3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the original Euro2.2 billion.
The problems of holding the newest frigates at anchor are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings of Germany’s navy power reduction.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was actually “completing a stock of ships capable of deploying”.
The official said that the problem had become more acute over time because old ships had been decommissioned but had not been assigned to replace them.
He visited that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates could ever be taken into service by the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study carried out in one of the Scottish hills is designed to show how bats use the landscape to find food.
It is hoped that the data will provide a new look at the behaviour of unique winged mammals and help in the future conservation of the species.
A study organized by the National Foundation of Scotland will examine common netopics, sopranos, and brown long-haired bats and Dobanton nights, inhabited by Invewe Gardens, West Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some locations around the site to monitor the actions of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile site surveys using hand-detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be drawn up to provide a detailed picture of their landscape-wide behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of habitat management, such as grasslands, as well as how to keep the forest in a state optimal for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the last century.
They are at risk of extinction due to construction and development works that affect their habitats and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can be dangerous, as well as adhesive fly ribbons, chemical processing of building materials, and home-cat hunt.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They're using complex echo-locating techniques to pinpoint the obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is very serious about the population of bats.
The organization has 10 trained experts who conduct regular interviews, excursions and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even created the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats live.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says the property is perfect for them.
"Here, in Threave, a perfect place for bats," he says.
"There are old buildings, many old trees, and all the elements of a good environment.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need to live well.
It recalls the importance of testing the presence of bats prior to maintenance within private domains, as the unintentional destruction of a single nest can result in the death of up to 400 females and young persons, and perhaps even the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by law, their destruction, harassment or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Flesh Mice Foundation, calls on the public to help.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many of their individual species live."
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the charges of rape against him, calling them “feek news,” and asserts that people simply “want to propiate,” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which has published charges against a footballer.
Forward of Portugal and Juventusa was charged with the rape of an American woman named Kathryn Majorga, who allegedly occurred in the hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her 375,000 dollars to talk about the incident, reported to the Spigel on Friday.
In a video at Instagram, in which a football player had 142 million followers, a few hours after the charges had been reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the information "fee-news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've told us today is all fake news,” claims the five-time winner of Ballon d'Or on the camera.
"They just want to pry with my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous by telling me my name, but it's just part of their work.
I'm a happy man, and I'm doing great,' he adds with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the Spiegel for the charges they called “inadmissible information about suspicions of confidentiality”, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Shertz stated that the player intended to claim compensation for “moral damage in an amount consistent with the gravity of the legal breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
When he met at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to the documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident Ronaldo fell on her knees and told her that he was “99% good, but one percent bad.”
According to the records, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was consensual.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that the hospital had taken pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement, because she felt “fear that she would be retaliated” and was afraid of “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman said that she was currently trying to change her place of residence, as she continued to experience traumatic feelings as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid of Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer went to the Italian giants of the Juva in a deal of 100 million euro.
Brexit: Britain "rewards for the automakers lost forever"
The Minister for Business and Entrepreneurship, Greg Clark, said that the United Kingdom “will regret it forever” if, after Brexit, it loses its status as the world leader in the car industry.
He also commented on the information that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, not far from Derby.
“We need a deal,” says Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese automaker stated that the effect of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could result in the loss of jobs.
The plant in Bernaston produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be halted,” says Marvin Cook, manager of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about getting out of the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will shut down the Mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that, according to automotive manufacturers, if there is no Brexit supply chain transaction, the risk will be high.
The Toyota production line is launched “at the right time,” and the parts for the autos that are manufactured on order are supplied by the British and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Great Britain withdraws from the EU on 29 March without a deal, there may be disruptions at the border that, according to industry, may result in delays and shortages of parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store its plant in Derbyshire for more than one day, so the production will stop.
Mr. Clarke said that Teresa May's plan, described in Checkers, for future relations with the EU “is precisely calibrated to avoid these cross-border checks.”
“We need a deal. We want to conclude a better deal that will not only make it possible to succeed now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he said on BBC Radio 4, “Today.
“Not only Toyota, but also other producers claim that we must be absolutely able to continue the successful supply chain.”
Toyota was not in a position to specify how long the production would be halted, but in the longer term warned that the extra costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tswallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory's union, says that the concern of the members of the organization is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will no longer be able to get them back.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, according to the White House.
The responsible meeting between Donald Trump and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “deferred to another week,” as the fight for Brett Cavanaugh’s candidacy for the position of Chief Justice continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Müller, who investigates Russia's intervention in the elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the potential obstacles to the President's justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General, thereby putting Mueller's independence at risk, in Washington for months has been a source of speculation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president by means of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein disproves this information.
However, last Monday, he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he “would have preferred not to” fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate's judicial committee, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blacey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation of the FBI's complaints against Cavanaugh, which further delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's Spokesman, Sarah Sanders, spoke at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it is possible this week, and it is possible that it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists have challenged this claim: Sanders has not held briefings at the White House since 10 September.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that the absence of briefings is not due to the “discretion of the community” of TV reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they play in public.”
She suggested an increase in the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The president holds more meetings to answer the questions of journalists than any other president before him,” she added, but did not give the exact figures: “We have these numbers.”
Sanders assured me that the briefings would continue, but “if the press is able to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.”
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the last few weeks, and if you can speak directly to the President of the United States, it's a worthy replacement for the press-briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare for a conference to be held exclusively for the press.
The free, and at times strange, behavior of the president in front of the gathered journalists this week in New York may be the answer to why.
The Minister of Health writes to the EU in Scotland about the fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health has approached the EU members of the Scottish TOS to express his gratitude to the country and to wish to remain in office after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, MSP, sent this letter to the staff less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to defraying the cost of processing the status applications for EU citizens serving in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman writes: “In the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued, and the expected decision is due this fall.
However, the British government is also increasing preparations for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very worrisome time for all of you.
It is, therefore, now that I want to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of every staff member, irrespective of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency head injury.
Michael Organe, from Tennessee, reported that a mid-defendant of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, had undergone an emergency operation after being hit by 31–27 in a match with the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Chief Trainer of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told the reporters that the injury was sustained shortly before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell down there," Reid said.
The coach and the medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting it on the stretcher and taking it to a medical check-up.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details on the type/step of the injury,” and in Tennessee they are trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
It was the first season of Tennessee State after moving out of Illinois.
On Saturday, before getting out of the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which totaled 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp fee to buy real estate in the United Kingdom.
In line with Tori’s new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee for the purchase of real property in the United Kingdom, and the extra money they have made will be used to help the homeless.
This step will negate Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
An increased stamp fee will be charged to those who do not pay the tax in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects it to collect up to £120 million a year for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher stamp fee for the purchase of real property in the United Kingdom, and the extra money that they have made will be used to help the homeless — something that Teresa May will announce today.
This step will nullify Corbin's attempts to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more accessible and to increase the income of citizens.
An increase in the stamp fee will be charged to non-tax individuals and firms in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus generated should stimulate the Government ' s efforts to assist the homeless.
The addition to the existing stamp collection, including an increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary and rental housing, may be up to 3 per cent.
The Treasury expects that this step will provide up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new real estate properties in London are not purchased by British residents, resulting in higher prices and making it more difficult for buyers who buy their first dwelling to improve their housing conditions later.
Many of the country's elite districts, particularly in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who, after buying a home here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp collection to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of squandering the price of real property by buying land, but not actually using it, and called on Ms. May to give up the quota for affordable housing to correct the “famous housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include the control of rents and the cessation of unjustified evictions.
He also wants to give the local government more power to construct new houses.
Ms. May said, "I said last year that I dedicated my premiere to the fulfilment of the British dream — to make life a better life with every new generation.
This means, among other things, solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
It is not fair, however, that for people who are not British citizens, as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real property is as affordable as the hard-working British.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring a home has become too far away, and the threat to some to be outdoors is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland."
The Sunderland Club's boss, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is to become a Scottish manager at a certain stage.
A 42-year-old Scotser enjoys the rebirth of the North-East Club, which is currently ranked third in the first league, detached from the top by three points.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren back to the Scottish Prime League last season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got the hat B, and that's it," Ross SportsOUND BBC Scotland said.
"But I grew up watching Scotland with my father in Hampden as a kid, and it always attracted me back.
But this is only possible if I can become a successful manager of the club.
Priors to Ross, Sunderland managers were also Dicka Avocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardides, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager, Alloa Athletic, said that he had not been appalled by such high-profile names in such large clubs, had previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich Town's offers.
“For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
By its structure and capabilities, the club is no doubt a member of the Prime League,” says the coach.
“It is not an easy task to get him out, but I will consider that I did my job only if I can get the club back.
Ross only served as manager for three years, first as assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at Hearts' coaching headquarters.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third level, and in the next season he led St Mirren down to win the championship.
Ross claims that he is more comfortable today than ever during his game career in Clide, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he remembers his responsible work at Alloa.
"I truly believed that management fits me more than a game.
It sounds weird, because I did everything well, I made a good job in this position, and I made some progress.
But the game is harder.
There's a lot of stuff to do weekly.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good at running.
I've always wanted to lead, and now, by doing this, I feel the most comfortable fish in the water for the rest of my adult life."
You can listen to a full interview at SportsOUND on Sunday, September 30, on the Scotland radio from 12:00 to 13:00 in English summer time.
According to the poll, 5:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer.
The summer heat has led to an increase in the sales of British pubs, but has lowered the sales of restaurants online.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, who received this statistic, says: “The continued solar activity, as well as the longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup, means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in the pubs rose by 2.8 per cent and in restaurants, on the contrary, declined significantly.
The June decline in income in restaurant trade by 1.8 per cent also continued in July.
Drinking pubs and bars have shown much better results in restaurants.
Pubs that only sell food have also suffered from the heat of the sun, though not as much as restaurants.
Seems like people just want to jump out to get a drink.
The sale of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% in a month, and the food rose by 3%.
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the entertainment and hotel industry, says: “These results have continued the trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events continue to be critical when it comes to sales on the non-profit market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant nets continue to experience difficulties, especially since a 4.8 per cent annual sales drop will be particularly painful due to continued price pressures.
A long hot summer has turned out more than ever to be the case for food operators, and it is not yet a fact that August, by bringing more temperate temperatures, will give much needed rest.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including those re-opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slower contraction of brands.
Monitoring the industry sales of the Coffer Peach Tracker for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses the productivity data of 47 networks with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is a recognized industry benchmark.
One out of five kids have secret social media accounts that they keep from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children — some of them only 11 years old — have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the pages of the "feek insta"
This news has heightened concerns about sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "primary" account that parents know about.
However, one out of every five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of online “insto” accounts, i.e., the Instagram, a website for the exchange of photographs.
This news has increased concerns about sexual content publications.
Twenty percent of the students said that they had a basic, “clean” account that their parents had access to, but also secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally had access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, ran into a teenager who had encouraged others to “rape him”.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Managers (HMC) found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two social media profiles, half of whom had admitted that one of them was usually secret.
HMC's head Mike Buchanan says, "Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and that is an alarming fact."
Aileed Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" of the Scots Light Athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilid Doyle was elected to the board of directors of the Scottish Light Athletics as an observer member of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most renowned athletic athlete, and Ian Beatty says that this is an excellent opportunity for sport managers to benefit from the vast experience of athletics at the international level over the past decade.
“Aylid has great respect in the Scots, the British, and the world's light athletic community, and we are confident that her participation will be of great benefit to athletics in Scotland,” says Beatty.
Doyle says, "I want to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can make a good contribution and promote sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has a total of four golden Olympic medals, and is now working as a regular commentator for BBC, and after a stroke he lost his ability to walk.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will tell me if I'm gonna get better, and if so, to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing a skillful exercise!
Thank you so much for your support!"
Advertisements of the milk sucker, in which breast-feeding moms were compared to cows, shared the views of Internet users
The milk-sucking company has raised disputes on the Internet by publishing an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers with cash cows.
By putting on the market, they say, “the world's first silent breast-sucker,” Elvie's consumer technology company published an advert music video showing the freedom that the new milk-sucker gives to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in full hay under the music track, saying, "Yes, I feed my own milk, but you won't see my tail," and "if you haven't noticed, it's not owl, it's my breast."
And the choir goes, "Healing, healing, we feed our babies with breast milk, we heal, we heal."
This commercial, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has given rise to controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video received mixed reactions from the audience, with many saying that it sheds light on the “wraths” of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are taken away from them within days of birth,” writes one user.
Elvie's milk sump is dressed directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
And another comment: "It is clear that it is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to promote a milk sausage for mothers who keep their children? "
Another user adds: “An ad that is detached from reality”.
Others, on the other hand, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was "just great."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was feeding the baby, I'd definitely buy one.
Breast-feeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a bit crazy, but it kind of feels that way.
A genius product," wrote one user.
And another comment: "A cool ad for moms who breast-feed (often do it directly in their work or in the toilets) and who do feel a bit like cows.
This ad is not for the purpose of praising or taunting our dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with these invisible milk suckers hidden under their brass.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk sucker is completely inexperienced, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in a breast-feeding bra, and is not visible, allowing women to move, keep their babies, or even go out on the street during the feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner in early childhood development of Mother, comments: “Elvie's microsucker is a product so revolutionary that it deserves a bold and provocative ad.
In parallel between women and milk cows, we wanted to focus on breast-feeding and all its problems, displaying in a funny and cheerful way the incredible sense of freedom that the new sucker gives us.
It's not the first time that Elvie's milk sucker hits the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of the two children appeared on the podium of the designer Martha Yakubowski, using the product for the purpose.
Hundreds of migrant children moved unobstructedly to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children had increased dramatically, although the number of monthly cross-border crossings had remained relatively constant, in part because the strict rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration had made it difficult to place children in the caretakers.
Generally, most of the sponsors themselves are the same undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by taking care of a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential trustees and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-level immigration and customs officer, testified at the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked for bail for minors who had not been cared for.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“Around 80 per cent of those who are either trustees or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a significant proportion of them are foreign offenders.
So we continue to pursue these individuals,” Albens said.
In an effort to speed up the process of enrolling children, the officials had introduced new rules that some of them should be brought to trial within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, as they had previously been.
To state their legal status to the immigration judge, many are present by video link, not in person.
Those who are considered not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to the shelter workers and the information that has emerged in the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become alarmed or depressed, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of difficulty for the child are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them time to prepare for it emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends may add to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the US, France, and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mu'alem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country had been at war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces had been on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the assembly.
Mu'alem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been driven out of their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we rid all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 military personnel in Syria, who are mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Mu'alem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and he accused “some Western countries” of “proliferating irrational fears” that had led the refugees to stay outside the country.
“We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he says.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to rebuild until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN Diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major siege of the rebels Idlib created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Mu'alem stressed that the agreement had a “determined time frame” and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including militants from the al-Qa'idah front of Nusr, who “will be destroyed”.
UN Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the Government and the opposition, will be convened in the near future to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, stating that the work of the commission should be limited to “considering the articles of the current constitution” and cautioned against interference.
Why Trump wins the second term
In keeping with this logic, Mr. Trump will win his re-election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal do not prematurely complete his presidency, which is likely to be the hope of many liberal viewers.
And this will no doubt be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in history!”
At the moment, there is no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, the prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million per CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Madow Show" has surpassed the ratings of cable channels, gathering 3.5 million viewers at night during the main news show.
“This is the fire that people are reaching for, because it is beyond our grasp,” says Neil Bere, director of the ABC drama, “Designed Survivor,” about a member of the Cabinet who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by the attack.
Nell Scowell, a long-public comedy writer and author of "Only Funny: Some Disgusting Truths About Infiltration of the Hollywood Boys' Club," offers another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi to Boston once before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?," she asked.
He said, "Because he's funny," she says.
In all this chaos, there's something of value -- it's fun.
Of course, unlike the rest of the content on TV, Washington's storylines can determine the future of "Row vs. Wade" and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you've been watching a group of experts for six hours in a row discuss the use of Bob Woodward's "deep background" for his book "Fear," or Paul Manafort's $15,000 strut skin jacket (clothes warmed up with pride), as the Washington Post writes, or the dramatic description of Stormy Daniels, let's say, the anatomy of Mr. Trump, is out of line.
I, for instance, will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes.
“Perfectly, his job is to make us feel that the reality show is that he feeds you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, the executive director of Weelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of the Pawn Stars about the changing cast of the Trump show and the daily twists of the story (the N.F.L. fight, the praise of Kim Jong Eun).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleis this week, there was 27 degrees of heat on the north bank of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he hid inside his home and watched MSNBC during CNN's record.
He couldn't get off the screen, at least not exactly when they show how Brett Cavanaugh stands before the Senate's Legal Committee and decides the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we did all this crazy show, people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flyce says.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money is infiltrated in the worst interim elections held by the White House.
Not surprisingly, the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a cash flow due to the change in districts in Congress, in which two officials compete for the same place.
This suburb of Pittsburgh, whose geography was recently changed, is supported by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another active official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly intersecting with the new 17th.
The maps had been revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had ruled in January that, as a result of the electoral frauds, the old districts had been attributed to the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district led to a hot debate on the financing of campaigns between the main party's financial forces, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (RCC).
The name Lamb came to be known in Pennsylvania after winning a small difference in the March special congressional elections in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give Democrats a small advantage.
The US punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, which had led to Washington's negative reaction.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, who also owned Panama until his partners evicted the Trump management team.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to withdraw the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “the recent decisions on the non-recognition of Taiwan”, which was announced earlier this month by the Spokesman of the Department of Heather Nauert.
However, only El Salvador, which had received about $140 million of American aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support, was being considered.
The proposed penalties, including a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the country of Central America, with its high rate of unemployment and murder.
Against the background of regular internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held to take stock of a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, high-level officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, and had effectively discontinued the issue of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to the diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be addressed by Vice-President Mike Pence to show that the Administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
The three American diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without bringing any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House representative, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three United States officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss internal matters, subject to anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by an external analyst who is in line with the administration, but who also spoke anonymously.
Learn History
The next step might be to report to Special Adviser Robert Müller on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's justice, which was now very significant in the public records.
Mr. Mueller is also said to be beginning to investigate the existence of Trump's collusion with Russia and its attacks during the past elections.
If Congress replaces the host, Mr. Trump will face the responsibility of this body, just as he prepares to speak again to the voters, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there is a lot of ifs; I do not mean that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is his equivalent in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and that would have happened if the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we did not do so, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
The course of history is taking place at such points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
The Americans are going through some of these critical moments right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to this newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records of the President's activities and reasoned that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that The Times data are incorrect.
“How will we react if the recent FBI-requested investigation of Britt Cavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is finally admitted to the position of Chief Justice, despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we, in the medium term, vote for the Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to make it through the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew, exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied a Polish home that I lived in years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she led me to light Saturday candles on a table with a symbol of swastika.
With a family past like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic in the run-up to the football club of the Vienna Rapid.
The Rangers accept the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after an impressive tie in Spain over the Villarreal earlier this month, will enable them to take a strong position in the League of Europe Group G.
The knee injury prevented the semi-defendant Graham Dorrans from performing for the first time in the season, with a score of 2:2 against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard to achieve a lot of results.
“This was a good moment for us, because "Villarreal" is a good team,” said a 31-year-old footballer.
"We entered the game, thinking we could get something, but we left with no one.
We may have been able to handle it in the end, but in general, it was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success was at the second half, where we were better.
This Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be a hard game, because they've shown good results in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, given everything that's got to do with my injuries, and the replacements at the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is perfect, and the guys are really enjoying it, and the training has been done on the "ura."
I hope we can move forward, put the last season behind us, and make it a success.”
Women have lost sleep for fear of their pension savings
Although the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people involved in the national study said that they had discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
However, only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they don't try to talk to them about it,” says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide Life Insurance.
And that's how we start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and how you will receive medical care, as this may be an important cost factor.
Consult with your financial consultant to help you draw up a plan for the payment of these expenses.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care policy or a mixed life insurance policy, which will help to cover the costs or self-insurance by means of your own property, provided that you have money.
Get your legal documents in order: get rid of the legal battles.
Make a health care trust and appoint a trustee who will monitor your health care and make sure that professionals do what you want if you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that consideration be given to the possibility of establishing a financial power of attorney.
A trusted person should be selected to help you make financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your accounts in the event that you are incompetent.
Do not forget the small things: Imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to provide information on the drugs he's taking and on what he's allergic to?
Write down all the details on the paper so that you can be well prepared just in case.
Martin adds: “It is not only the availability of finance, but also the choice of doctors.”
"What drugs do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Draw up and write down the plan. "
In Ilphrakomba, a man fired a pneumatic rifle a number of times.
A man shot a number of times with a pneumatic rifle, coming home from a party.
The victim, whose chest, abdomen, and arm were hit by bullets, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilphrakombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 in English summer time, as an “accident”.
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the failure of communications, rescue workers are unable to get any information from Donggal, an area north of Pale, which is close to the epicentre of the 7.5-point earthquake.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Donggal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami erupted.
Donggala is a district stretching along 300 km (180 miles) of the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, a county smaller than the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are at the heart of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, and in particular the coastal region of Donggal.
Nickel mining is also important for the economy of the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morival, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, in the past 100 years, the tsunami has destroyed Palau and Donggal on several occasions.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggal.
The tsunami also took place in Western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Vulcan Fire Ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 hit south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 occurred in Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 occurred on one of the Mentawai Islands at Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the district of Pidi Jai in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake of 2004 and the tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily remained in ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is under arrest for domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska, and the vice-president of Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfered with the situation of domestic violence and for resisting the arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the State Police of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a friend of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su and will be released on bail at $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he claimed his “contested innocence”.
Palin faces three class A minor crimes, which means that he may be imprisoned for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B crime punishable by up to one day ' s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun in a state of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son's brutal behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of 7,5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The social media show videos of the incident.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The Federal Attorney's Office wants to impose a rare death sentence on a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Syfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York, which resulted in the death of eight people, a rare penalty for a federal crime that has not been used in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, aged 30, allegedly rented a home Depot truck to attack a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that the Saïps had “deliberately” killed eight people and “deliberately” caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to achieve the death penalty in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges may be subject to the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the grand federal jury read Saipov a conviction with 22 counts of murder, which included eight charges of racketeering, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a charge of the use of violence and the destruction of cars.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “deliberately planned and premeditated”, the Saïps carried out it, as described, “in a repulsive, brutal and criminal way”.
“Sifullo Habibullaevich Saïpov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Henrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lore Decada, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damiana Pugnukko,” states the notification of intent.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since, in the Southern District of New York, the prosecutor demanded the death penalty for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was convicted for the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty in a federal case in New York was last imposed in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed for collusion to spy in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed using an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the Saipov judicial documents, an Uzbek national showed no remorse after his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by the video of ISIL on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital ward, and reported to the police.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on Saipov's side, said that they were “apparently disappointed” by the decision of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
“We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty, rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only add to the pain of all those involved,” said Patton.
The defence of Saipov had previously made a request to the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Member of Parliament for Tori says that NYJEL FARAGE should not be responsible for the Brexit talks
Today, during the protest at the Tori conference, Nigel Faraj vowed to “mobilize the people's army”.
Former Ukip leader said that politicians should “feel” euro skeptics, as a member of Parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a rally in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "upgraded" if Mr. Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem that Ms. May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that the members of the Tori Party, who oppose the EU, join in a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The premier is working hard to keep his compromise plan, as expressed in Checkers, in the midst of attacks by Brexit, his opponents, and the EU.
The allies insist that it continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite a negative reaction, and thus force Euroskeptics and Labourers to choose between its package and the “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihall that he wanted to play Checkers.
He suggested that Mr. Faraj be levelled and held responsible for the talks with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we'd be out,” he said.
Deputy Wellingborough added, "I will continue to stand for Brexit, but we need to beat Checkers."
Addressing the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: “The idea that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay was completely untrue.
Brexit's supporter to the Tori Party, Andrea Jenkins, was also at the rally, commenting to the press: "I say, Prime Minister, just listen to the people."
“Chekers is unpopular in the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also unpopular among the members of our party and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and choosing us first.
Please put it down to Checkers and start listening to what you're told.
In her strong address to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers shall remain in office if they remain true to their promises.”
Mr. Faraj said that if politicians were to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum, they should be made to “fear up”.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you get away with it."
Referring to the thrilled crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brixit's betrayal, to feel a little bit overwhelmed.
“We will mobilize the people's army of this country, which has given us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
In the meantime, Brexit's opponents took a demonstration on Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A number of activists waved "Tori vs. Brexit" this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, criticized the conservatives because of security problems in their party's mobile attachment.
“And these people claim to be able to set up the IT systems and technologies of Canada plus plus, to work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's one complete farce.
There is no good Brexit in principle,” he claims.
Warren's planning to “study” the possibility of a presidential race.
The U.S. Member of Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, says that after the November elections, she will “studyly explore the possibility of running for presidents.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting in the West Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Deale, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There's talk that she's got a chance to take up the Trump post in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Holioca, she held another meeting with the voters; since Trump took up office, it was her 36th meeting with the voters in the format of a meeting of the City Hall.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for "the women to go to Washington to "repare" our broken government, and to that end, there must be a woman up there."
As a result of Sims' murder, the LSU player was arrested
Baton Rouge, Louisiana State Police, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder of the LSU basketball player, Wade Simms, had been arrested on Friday.
At 11:00 p.m. in English time, at a press conference, the Baton-Rose Police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the Police Department released a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify the person who was filmed.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot at South University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Simms was shot in the head and died,” said the Chief of Police, Murphy J. Paul, to the press on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being involved in the incident, carrying a gun, and shot Wade Simms.
When he was arrested, Simpson failed to resist and was taken into custody at the East Baton County Police Department.
He grew up in Baton-Rose, 32 games with 10 games last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the title of World Champion after command tactic gave him the victory over Sebastian Fettel.
It has become clear from the moment that Walderty Bottas passed his qualification on Saturday, overstepping Lewis Hamilton, that the Mercedes team tactic will play a major role in the race.
Already with the Pole-Position Bottas had a good start and practically hang out on Hamilton when he was defending his position at the first two corners, and he invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton swollen in the tail of the group, a choice that became decisive.
The Mercedes went off to a pit-stop one lap later, and then went behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel struggle, hurled forward, leaving the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner space free, risking getting caught after double-moving for protection at the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstoppen started from the back row of the net and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
He then ran most of the race, holding on to his own tires, with the aim of quickly finishing, moving Kimi Rykkonen to fourth place.
As a result, he went to the pit stop on the 44th round, but he was unable to increase the pace of the remaining eight laps, as Rykkonen was ranked fourth.
It's been a hard day, because Walderry did fantastic work this weekend and showed real nobility by sharing it with me.
The team did such an extraordinary job to have a couple of tricks in reserve," said Hamilton.
Traitory sign language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her claim that she had not made public a letter from Christina Blacey Ford, who accused Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of Chief Justice, of sexual harassment.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the Ford statement given to the Senate's Legal Committee, saying that what was happening in the Senate had shown that the participants in those events were “smart, filthy, and deceitful people.”
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what has been happening in the last few days in the Senate, is perfect, it's anger, anger, abomination, and lies,” he said.
"You see all the leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you "leave" information?
Do you remember her answer... did you "leave" the information of the document? - "what, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.
Okay, stop.
We've been "silent"? ...No, we didn't "silent," he added with the senator's tone.
In July, a letter detailing the charges against Cavanaugh was sent to Feinstein, and in early September it was illegally released, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
“I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, but I didn't leak her information,” Feinstein said to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the manner in which she denied the charges of the leak seemed to dislike the president, who commented on it during the Saturday rally, "I'll tell you what, the body language really failed her.
She may not have "slept," but the body language was the worst I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend his candidate for the position of Chief Justice, who had been accused by three women of sexual harassment, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are certainly trying to regain power in all possible ways.
We see abhorrentness, abhorrentness, they don't care who they're gonna hurt, who they're gonna go through to get power and control,” quotes Mediaite.
British elite hockey league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Jayants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals, for "Jayants" in a game against "Dandy"
In the Elite Hockey League game, Dundee Stars paid for a Friday's defeat against Belfast Jayants, winning a return match on Saturday with a score of 5-3 in favor of Dundee.
The Jayants won an early two-point advantage thanks to the hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the level of the home team before Dwyer led the Giants.
Francois Bouchard compared the score to "Dundey" before the two hollows of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
For the people of Adam Keef, who had won the Dundee at 2:1 in Belfast on Friday night, this was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
Between the parties, it was the fourth meeting in the season, when the Jayants won the three previous games.
Dwyer's first goal was at 3:35 p.m. after Kendall McFall's ball pass, with David Rutherford's support, after which Boviller doubled the privilege four minutes later.
During the start-up period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Markwardt helped Coney level the account at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer made sure the Jayants intercepted the initiative at the first break when he scored the second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The owners regrouped, and Bouchard rebalanced the score, scored the goal at 27:37.
Coney and Charles Corcoran united to help Nielsen give "Dundey" the first time in the match to gain leadership at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured the victory by holding the rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Jayants, who have so far lost four of the last five games, are on their way to Milton Keynes for the next match, to be held on Friday.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on board could escape the earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was given the title of hero postmortem after he deliberately went to death to make sure that the plane with hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives as a result of the severe earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, which caused the tsunami.
Strong suburbs continue to demolish the area, and many of the people of the city of Palu are under the rubble of the buildings.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the horrendous swinging tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufry Airport, Palu City.
He remained in his seat to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was in the airstrip at the time, was able to fly safely.
Then, when he thought the tower was crashing, he jumped off it.
He later died at the hospital.
An Indonesian aeronautical representative, Johannes Sirait, said that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter boarded Pala.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths from the earthquake can reach thousands, as the disaster management agency reports that access to the towns of Donggal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to rise, as a large number of people are still under the rubble, and many have never been able to get out,” says a representative of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters have devastated the city of Pala, where a mass grave of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: "Emergency is bringing the victims in every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Mini-markets have been pillaged everywhere.
Jan Gelfund, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, tells CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is already rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're gonna find.
The tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but it can be much worse.
President Joko Vidodo of Indonesia arrived in Palau on Sunday and addressed the country's armed forces, inter alia, by saying: “I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the evac-related tasks.
Are you ready?” CNN explains.
Early this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lomboca, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports a missing person after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagune in Micronesia now reports that one person is missing, while it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew left the sinking plane safely.
Air Niugini states that on Saturday afternoon, she has no information about a single male passenger.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and the police to try to find the man.
The airline was not in a position to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
The local sailors helped save the other passengers and the crew of the plane after it fell on the water trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers had been hospitalized on Saturday and that they were all in a stable state.
The causes of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The U.S. Air Company and Navy claim that the plane landed in a lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft was unable to land on the airstrip.
American passenger Bill Janes says the plane started to enter the runway too low.
"And it's very good," Janes adds.
Janes said that he and other passengers had managed to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane, as the water level was up to the belt.
He also said that the stewardess had panicked and yelled on board, and that he had been slightly injured in the head.
The U.S. Navy reports that the seafarers who repaired the dock in the area also helped to rescue by using an inflatable boat that brought people to the shore before the plane was loaded down by about 30 meters (100 feet).
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have been killed in air crashes of companies registered with PNG in the last two decades, but none of these crashes were related to Air Niugini.
An Intel Analyst managed to prove that a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution brought a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rawlett, gave hours of testimony as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the department about how he used his cell phone records to make a general picture of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Roulette said that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, Tellis was spending time with Chambers that night, which contradicts his earlier testimony, reports The Clary Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data received, his cell phone was close to Chambers; when the fact became clear, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his statement, Sanford claimed that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that "it was a lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said that he had met Chambers two weeks before her death.
According to the phone records, however, they had been called for only one week.
Rollett also showed that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, her text messages, calls and contact information had been removed from her phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," says Hale.
The defence must begin to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is "conscious hip-hop?"
The hip-hopper trio is going to fight a negative view of this genre, filling its music with a positive content.
The High Breed of Bristol claimed that the hip-hop content had changed from the original political and social problems.
The members of the group want to return to their roots and make the “conscious” hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugues and the Common have recently witnessed a renaissance in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!!
The New York nanny sued the couple for a racist text.
The New York nanny sued the couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny was “another black” that the woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
Spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the claim is “for the purpose of extortion”.
Lyncy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of the two children, expressed concern that the new nanny offered by the childcare service, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to the family on her first day of work in 2016.
"No, it's not, it's not, it's a black one," Mrs. Plasco-Flexman texted her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice wrong.
Realizing her error, the “consumptive” Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, claiming in the service that the nanny, who had turned out to be African-American, had not done her job well, and that they had been expecting a Filipino, not an African-American, report the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work, and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now sues for a couple and claims $350 a day for dismissal in six months, under the terms of the initial oral agreement, which, however, was not established by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she said, “Post” on Friday, adding, “and I know that this is discrimination.”
Spouses disagree with the charge of racism, and claim that the dismissal of Maurice can be considered a reasonable step, since by resenting her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her in a message that she didn't really mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joe Plasco, the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone you've been rude to, even if you've been rude, not wanting to?
Would you trust your new baby?
Oh, come on!
Calling the claim “forgery”, Plasco said that his wife had only had a baby two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“And are you ready to pursue a man in this situation?
It's not very kind of you," added a banker specializing in investment.
The trial is still under way, but public opinion has already handed down a sentence on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behaviour and logic.
Paddington’s publishers feared that the readers would not understand the move with the talking bear, says in a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, said of the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the position of the first person to read the work, even before it was published.
It's very funny to know that Paddington is a huge success."
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the bear, had worked as an operator for the BBC, and would have taken the rejection of the publication with optimism, and added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication of his books had been “and joyous and bitter” since the author had gone away last year.
As far as the Paddington bear itself is concerned, she speaks of him as “a very important member of our family,” and that her father was quietly proud of the fact that his character was finally known.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” his daughter says.
“The fact that Paddington was so real to him, and for the father, it was almost as if his own child had made progress: he was proud of him, though he did not really consider that success to be his own merit.
I think that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always gave credit to the bear itself.
I had to say good-bye to my dying daughter on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Hospital of Nice, Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors had failed to save her life.
“It was a regular call and said that it was really bad that something went wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza.
"Then he called again and said that she was gonna die in the next two minutes, and that we should say good-bye.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that the doctors had given her, forcing her heart to work, had gradually ceased to work, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I should have just sat there and waited, knowing it was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry, or scream, or cry, because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself together."
After all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa, grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, humbling with the huge loss that she had just had to endure.
“No one around knew what had happened,” she says.
"My head went down, I didn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this all-encompassing empathy for Nad.
He so needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who have survived the loss of loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are posting postcards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that can be used by people to seek support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he started to get depressed, and at the age of 18, he killed himself.
“I don't want other parents to feel the same way I feel every day,” she says.
A 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Leedney, says that her son was a great cook and had a damn charming smile.
"Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was like a light was on in the room.
But before he died, he left his job because he was going through a really bad time.
This happened in 2014, and Tyler was found dead by his brother, who was 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, "I don't stop fearing a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis invented these cards “to make people know that there is someone to talk to and talk to, even if it's your friend.
You can't sit and keep quiet, you have to talk to people."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, had lost Mark, her husband, who had lived with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother had died.
“He didn't say he was feeling depressed, upset or anything,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas, he was particularly ill: he didn't even look at the children when they opened their presents.

The future of Brett Cavanaugh is on the line: the FBI is opening an investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for — an investigation limited in time and volume, we could bring a little unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “breaking up” against the background of a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Time is the cause of their hesitation.
Intermediate elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November, and, if, as expected, it will go bad for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want and to elect him as the supreme judge of the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators to lobby for the support of Mr. Cavanaugh, who has since worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It was still not clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh would be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the problem of equality of votes and to confirm his candidacy for the office of the Chief Justice.
The number of defectors from North Korea decreased under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has declined, said the South Korean legislator.
Park Byung Seug, referring to the data of the Ministry of the South, stated that the figure had fallen to 1,127 in the past year, compared to 2,706 escapes recorded in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors had been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates imposed by smugglers.
Pyongyang doesn't make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953 more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people run through China, with the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China viewed defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subjected them to forced repatriation.
North-South relations, which are still in a state of war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This took place after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yoon Ho accused the US of obstructing progress on the issue by means of sanctions.
“Unless we have the slightest confidence in the US, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” said Mr. Ri in his address to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "historical," and claims that he is not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of Chief Justice, “hysterical” and said that he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court because of her temper.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at a Texas Tribune Festival event in Austin, Texas.
“I can't help but think that if a woman ever let herself behave like that, she'd be called a "stress," says Pelosi about her reaction to Cavanaugh's statement to the Senate Law Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blacie Ford's allegations of sexual harassment, which allegedly occurred when they were both teenagers.
Cavanaugh was quite emotional, and at times even suffocated and suffocated about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him a “gross and well-planned murder of the actor,” organized by the liberals, angered by the loss of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Cavanaugh's testimony had only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he's disqualifying himself with his claims, as well as the way he's attacking the Clintons and the Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi resented when asked if she would try to bring Cavanaugh to justice if his guilt was confirmed, and if the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I'll say, if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the trial he's at,” said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearing of his candidacy, Cavanaugh had sidetracked the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time to let a hysterical and biased person take up the position of Chief Justice, but to say, ‘How wonderful!’, Pelosi says.
And women have to own it.
It's a righteous anger, months and years of anger, she can't go through it without tears.
“When we're angry, we're crying,” Miss Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think it is?"
She went on to say, "I've had a lot of help from a woman who's been working in a management position somewhere, and she told me that she cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that she used to explain to her interviewer, "You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really mad."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed with this approach.
Tears are allowed as an exit to anger, in part, because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in an office dominated by men: one day I cried out of furious anger, but I was grabbed by an old woman's chisel, a soulless manager, who I was always afraid of, and dragged to a staircase.
“Never let them see you weeping,” she said to me.
“They don't know you're crying out of anger.
They think you're upset, and they're thrilled to think that you've finally got mad at you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some casual affair and left the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she would not run for the presidency.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called the case "White Snow and Seven Dwarves."
The campaign was coming to an end, lagging behind in the fund-raiser, and so it vowed not to be in the race if it didn't raise $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who had given $1,000 to men, had offered her only 250.
“What am I to them, a high-valued product, or something?”, she wondered.
When she gave her speech, declaring that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so emotionally engrossed — thanks to the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made it so difficult to collect money and access to the voters, and the anger of gender-based discrimination that she was suffocating.
“You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still wondering, what would they write on my monument?
"She cried all the time?"
How a trade war with America can be of use to Beijing
The experts believe that the first spikes of the US-China trade war have been stunning, and, while the battle is far from over, the split between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year, taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar, steel, and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has been putting equivalent backlashes each time, recently putting a levy on American goods at 60 billion dollars, at between 5 and 10 per cent.
China has promised that the response to the US will be equal every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to begin to face at least the slightest difficulty in the near future.
To force Washington to back down means to give up the demands, but to give up the US publicly would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts believe that, if Beijing can play its cards right, the US trade war pressure can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a prompt political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that will lead to an economic corking in any of these countries is in fact far more dangerous than previously acknowledged by the observers,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, specializing in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “prepared” for the return of refugees
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help in the reconstruction of a country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mu'alem reported that conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and secure thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to rebuild terrorist-destroyed areas so that people can live there in peace.
At present, all conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have had to flee because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for helping to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance on any terms or from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe anchors the victory at the Rider Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider Cup, winning the US team with a total of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US has already lost six times in a row on European land, and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe restored the crown to itself thanks to the team of the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Miquelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, struck his first long-distance punch in the water on the 16th hole of a pair of three, giving way to his match, Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming the 1-4 players who ever went 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit lost 5:4 with the lowest ratings in the European team, Turbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
One of the world's best players, Dustin Johnson, gave up 2:1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have been in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, was the winner of the tournament in Europe's history, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a hard year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help,” says emotional Garcia after a European victory.
He gives the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who won the American golf legend by Tiger Woods on Sunday, with a score of 2:1 in a single game.
“I am incredibly proud of this victory — I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These scores are rather odd for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles with only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought for the whole weekend, in vain trying to succeed, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed the highest-class golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furic of the United States said after his team's discomfort, "I'm proud of these guys, they've been fighting.
This morning, we managed to beat Europe a bit.
It didn't work.
Take off the hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played excellent.
We regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on to success.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to lose.
We lost."
Red Tide: The news has reduced the concentration of microorganisms in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The most recent report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife shows a general decline in the concentration of the red tide in some parts of the Bay of Tampa.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier, there is a high rate of blooming, indicating a decrease in microorganisms.
The Red Tide stretches about 130 miles of the coastline from the northern Pinell to the southern districts of Lee.
The oats can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but the number has fallen significantly since last week.
The red tide is also observed in Pascoe County.
Last week, average concentrations in and around the Pinellas district, from low to high concentrations in the Hillsboro region, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasota and in the coastal areas, medium concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations on the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County, were reported.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier, there is still a risk of respiratory irritation.
In Northwest Florida, this probability was not reported last week.
