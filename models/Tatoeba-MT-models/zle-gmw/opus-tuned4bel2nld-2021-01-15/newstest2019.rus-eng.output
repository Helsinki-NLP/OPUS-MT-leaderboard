Number of new recruits preparing to be sent to Donbas from Ukraine
Andrei Marocko, an official of the National Police of the self-proclaimed Lugano People ' s Republic (LNP), said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbas.
So, he said, Kyiv is planning “to do something to complete the units”.
“The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, mass dismissals have led to a low level of staffing of units,” said Marokko, quoted by the RIA News.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of enlisted Ukrainians could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kyiv launched the so-called Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO), which was later reassigned to the Joint Forces (JO).
This measure was expected to lead to a greater role for Ukrainian militants in the resolution of the situation.
In late August 2018, the situation in Donbassa was exacerbated by the murder of the head of the DND, Alexander Zaharchenko.
The DNR authorities have described what happened as a terrorist attack.
In the course of the investigation of the criminal case, a number of persons involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage had been carried out by the Ukrainian intelligence services.
The U.S. authorities forced Mask to leave the office of president of Tesla
An American businessman, Ilon Musk, will resign from the position of president of the board of directors of Tesla's company at the request of the U.S. authorities.
In order to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman will also pay $20 million to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial arrangement with the agency allows the Mask to remain in the leadership position at Tesla.
In doing so, he is required to pay $20 million and to leave the office of chairman of the board of directors within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is clarified that the agreement has yet to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it was reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had accused the Mask of deceiving the shareholders with a claim for sufficient funds to buy the company's shares and had sued the entrepreneur.
It's about a businessman tweeting, where he claimed he wanted to buy Tesla shares for $420 apiece, but he never did.
After tweeting, the company's shares grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British MIDA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and the prison
The British Minister for Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, compared the EU with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of captivity to the member countries of the community.
This statement was made by the diplomat at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail points out, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was set up to defend freedom, and the Soviet Union did not let anyone leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you convert the EU from a community to a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who will want to escape from captivity,” the Minister said.
He added that trying to punish Britain for getting out of the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gaceta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May stated that the Brexit talks had stalled.
So she commented on the outcome of the EU informal summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was taken in 2016 by referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will work together after London has left the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea gave two dogs to the President of South Korea
South Korea's president, Mun Jae In, received two puppies from North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un after his visit to Pyongyang.
Reuters reports this with a reference to a representative of the South Korean president's administration.
"At the summit, a pair of punsan dogs were offered as a gift.
On Thursday, they were received,' said the department.
To the dogs for about a year, the North Korean side “as a means of adapting them” handed over a few kilograms of feed.
A gift was made to mark the inter-Korean summit held from 18 to 20 September in Pyongyang.
The Hunsan hunter from the North Korean wolves received a name from a district of the DPRK.
According to the agency, Moon likes animals, he already has two of the dogs that the last North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, gave him.
Dogs aren't the only gift.
Kim Jong-un also gave his co-worker two tons of delicate matsutake mushrooms.
He ordered the distribution of the mushrooms to members of families separated during the Korean War who had not yet been reunited with their loved ones from the DPRK.
The head of the Altai Village Council stopped the hunger strike in defence of the interests of the people
The deputy announced on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for a number of reasons.
The head of the council stated that the situation was at a standstill, that the district administration did not respond to his demands, and that he had to do his job.
In addition, the Public Prosecutor's Office had begun to check the situation, and the WSPO had promised to start work on the preparation of the system for the winter heating period of the Siberian village next week.
The people of the village council also drafted and removed to the Governor of the Altai region a mass collective treatment “in connection with the current catastrophic situation”.
Boronin himself said that he was feeling normal, and that he was the head of the hunger strike.
As Boronin explained, the towns of Siberia and Rogulica have central heating systems, and therefore the authority to prepare them for winter must be exercised by the administration of the Pervomai region.
To date, however, no one has started the work.
The head of the council also protested against the lack of proper control and support by the Government of the Altai Region and against the financial policy of Gazprominterregiongas Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the villages for the winter, Boronin required “to immediately organize a full-fledged and self-sustaining locality with the corresponding staff units in the municipality”.
Named Moscow's newest, cheapest apartments
In the first six months of 2018, about 3,000 housing units were purchased in the new buildings of Moscow, with an area of 30 square metres and a value of up to four million roubles.
More than half of these transactions involved two VCs, the Urbanus Portal, which is available to Lenta.ru.
The heads of the housing sales in the budget of up to four million roubles were the LK Nekrasovska, located behind the ICAD, in the Kothelnik (Uvao) area, and the "Barbaris" complex in the Biberevo (BUAO) area.
Two VCs in New Moscow, the South Bunino and the Children's Alleys, are also visible in the structure of the housing transactions.
The Urbanus analysts point out that the share of rents up to four million roubles in these new buildings is 60 percent of the total sales and accounts for half of the total.
“The impact of apartments with a budget of less than four million roubles on the commercial success of the Central District in the New Watts and the Lung FCC” is to be recognized,” says a study of two more New Moscow LKs.
They account for about 35 per cent of financial income.
Previously, the ratings for the most low-cost apartments in the new buildings in Moscow were presented to the Bon Ton Real Estate Agency.
According to the company, the lowest prices for primary housing (149.9 thousand roubles per metre) were recorded in SWAO in September 2018.
Second and third place were VAO and SWAO, with 184.1 and 192.8 thousand roubles, respectively.

Telegram users complained about a failure in the new version
Users of the iPhone have complained about problems in the Telegram messaging after the update of September 28.
The user's phone number can be traced to the user's username
The complaints concern gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to the owners, when updated, the application displays a white screen or closes it immediately.
Missinger's representatives reacted to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be linked to the migration of information to a new Swift application.
On Telegram, the automatic update of the application was temporarily suspended until the bugs were resolved.
On April 13, the Tagan Court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's application for the blocking of Messinger Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the liaison operators began to implement the decision.
The reason was the misender's administration's refusal to provide the FSB with the key to decrypting the correspondence needed to obtain terrorist data.
In August, Telegram changed the privacy policy and agreed to uncover the IP address and the mobile number of the terrorist user suspect when a court decision was taken.
Telegram was reduced by 1.2 million after the blockage in the Russian Federation.
I'm glad for the guys who went out for the digital advantage in a game with the Mina Dinamo.
Bob Hartley: Glad to see the guys who went out to realize the numerical advantage in a game with the Mina Dinamo.
Bob Hartley's Chief Coach "Avangarde" summed up the scores of the regular HLC against the Minese Dinamo (2:1).
A very important victory for us.
After the match in St. Petersburg, we held a meeting and agreed that we should put the game behind us and prepare for Minsk.
We knew Dinamo had a good win before we met, so we were very serious about it.
It was important to drop in most, I'm glad for the guys who went out to realize the numeric advantage.
We've been playing well in most of the world lately, but we can't score.
At last, the red light outside the gate lit.
We knew that Minsk was going to be loaded to the game, try hard, and that's what happened.
The game in most of the game has become a defining goal, and it's in unequal composition that we've scored the win-win goal.
We managed to have a good third period today, despite the fact that we missed the early goal in that segment, and it was clear that it would not be easy in the future.
But we played very well in the defense, didn't give a lot of chance to the opponent, didn't let us on shifts, Dinamo didn't have a number of attacks, so it all ended well for us, and that's what Hartley's press club said.

Johnson's statement on the opening day of the annual Party Congress of the Tories in Birmingham was published by The Sunday Times.

In the ninth round of the Russian Cup of Football, the Blue-Blue Blues gave up to the Mahachkalin "Ange" with a score of 1:2.
There's no underestimation, there's two teams playing, and the same guys have shown that luck needs to be earned.
Of course, luck was on the side of Ange - both the penalty and the goal.
Understandably, this was preceded by our rude mistakes,” cites Semak Champion.com.

Ilon Musk is forced to resign as head of the board of directors of Tesla
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Musk settled their fraud dispute.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, as part of the agreements reached, the Mask will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Mask to retain the post of head of Tesla.
It is noted that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be taken from Tesla.
However, the money is distributed to the affected investors.
In addition, the company is required to appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American entrepreneur on the list of the 50 richest people on the planet in the Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX Space Corporation, the Neuralink Neuronology Company, and the developer of Tesla's electrocars, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued the Director General of Tesla Ilon Musk because of his tweet message about a possible buyout.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy out all stock at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the stock of $420 was allegedly “due to the importance of this number in the culture of marijuana”, previously reported by Bloomberg, with reference to Stephen Paykin's Co-Director of Security.
At the same time, Ilon Musk later gave up his plans to buy the shares.
Commenting on the US Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit against him, the businessman stated that he considered the fraud charges to be unsubstantiated, and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by the claims.
"Truth is the most important thing in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn't break it in any way," said a businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective suit against the Mask, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders claimed that the businessman's tweets had been misleading, forcing Tesla's stock sellers to buy paper at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that the careless remarks of Ilon Musk led to sharp swings in the course of the course.
In September, Ilona Musk was accused of trading fraud by the head of the Citron Research research company.
In the meantime, if Musk had not been able to settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been at risk of being suspended from the company and even imprisoned.
In particular, CNBC's former commissioner, Harvey Pitt, claimed this.
A mask is "a good guy who can't run a car company."

In the RPT, the possible renaming of the CPI was compared to the actions of the Nazis.
The head of the Division of External Church Relations (OCTS) of the Moscow Patriarchate of the Mitropolitan Volocolomsky Ilarion compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Nazis in Germany.
The Mitropolitan Volocolomsky Ilarion - about the causes of the conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchate, the possible church rift and its political connotation
According to him, at a time when “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage,” to rename the church is like in Nazi Germany, “the Jews will wear a yellow six-point star.”
"It means labeling the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that the bill was created," said the RPT representative on the TV channel Russia 24.
The Mitropolitan Police also stressed that the UCP is not a Russian Church, but a Ukrainian Church, because “the believers of this Church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country”.
OCP called on the Constantinople Exarchs to leave the area
The Grand Prix in Sochi: an applause, a Russian bull and the return of Kvyat
In the next 10 years, Russia may have its own race ball.
The vice-premier of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Kozak, said that he had taken up a meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
He also shared the view that Daniel Quyat would return to "Toro Rosso" and that the Russian phase of "Formula 1" would be visited.
As a result of our meeting with automakers, it is in the foreseeable future that the creation of the Russian Formula One, which has no analogues in the world, is what Dmitri Kozak said.
We need to encourage our automakers in this direction.
It was about planning until 2024, but I don't think it's possible in that time frame.
I think a more realistic time frame is in the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014, the "Marous" team performed under the Russian License in Formula One.
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors who are willing to invest in the creation of a national team in the World Auto races in the Formula One class.
I know that in Russia there are motor sports amateurs, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian team of Formula One, he noted.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of setting up the team has come up, too, because of the infrastructure in Sochi."
The Sochi Autodrome is waiting tomorrow.
According to Dimitri Kozak, the organizers have been able to sell all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even the qualifications of the podium have been almost complete,' noted the vice-premier.
I can tell you that this year's revenue went up by 72% over last year.
It's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the use of Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitri Kozak and the main theme of the day for the Russian auto-sporters was the return of Daniel Kwait to the Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him success next season,' said the vice-premier to the news.
He's a high-potential racer.
Next year, for the first time in history, Formula 1 will be able to take part in the two main Russian pilots.
Though the future of Sergei Orotkin in the Royal Races is still unknown.
His contract with William's ends at the end of the season, and the results are not as yet impressive: he was ranked 18th in Russia's Grand Prix.
Let's hope next season there will be more of our main pilots than this year, said Dmitri Kozak.

A few years earlier, when he had a cold, he had sown a slime from his own nose on a Petri cup (this is a glass lid in which bacteria are experimented) and a few days later he found out that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
It's almost the same way they found penicillin.
Fleming's name was added to the list of the 100 most outstanding individuals in human history.
Its discovery, in the view of many scientists, has changed the course of history.
With penicillin, medicine began to deal with most of the oldest diseases that had previously been considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, soon after the Nobel Prize, the Paris newspapers wrote, "For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
Experts estimate that Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people.
Alexander Fleming died in his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London Cathedral of St. Paul.
Where, by the way, my wife and I have come up with a speechful Russian tour guide.
And a few years later, Alexander Fleming's statue, in full growth, was seen in the most unexpected place in the capital of Spain.
There, next to the main arena for the Corrida Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to a man who, in their view, saved the lives of hundreds of outstanding artisans of the Corrida.
By the way, this, in my view, very interesting porcelain work was found there in Madrid, but at a different time, not at all.

The Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow ("The Iron Man", "The Loved Shakespeare") married producer Brad Felczak.
Although rumours of their wedding had been going on since April, the couple officially concluded only now, on 29 September.
According to People magazine, a private ceremony was held at the house of Paltrow in Long Island.

According to Business Insider, next year's payments will grow to $12 billion.
Last year, Google paid $3 billion for this option.
It is noted that the annual fee is calculated on the basis of how many Google search calls were made from Siri's voice helper and the Safari browser on iOS devices.

Trump told me about "love" in Kim Jong-un.
From mutual cruelty, the US and the DPRK's leaders almost got in love with each other, joked by Donald Trump.
US President Donald Trump made a good joke about his success on the frontline of a solution to the North Korean crisis.
Beginning with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now remedied their relationship so much that they are almost in love with each other, noted the American president.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama’s team had so started a relationship with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea that it had not even been able to reach the country’s leadership that it had simply not taken off the phone.
At the time, the US and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House "pretty letters," noted Trump.
Trump admitted that at the start of his work, he was "hard" to Kim Jong-un, which was, however, mutual.
But now their relationship has been refreshed so much that the leaders "loved each other."
At the same time, Trump asked me not to take it literally and warned that the American media would interpret it as incompetence.
Trump noted that Pyongyang had recently halted nuclear and missile tests and was closing military sites.
All of this is the credit of his administration, I'm sure the American president.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump lauded Kim Jong-un from the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and the steps taken to de-escalate the tension.
Trump noted, however, that the sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea would continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Singapore talks

The positive outcome of the meeting was the end of the nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers.
At the same time, other practical steps to denuclearize North Korea are still bouncing.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the US had already sent a number of disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangsters."

Nice called for the deletion of "Moscow language with a Ukrainian product"
The Ukrainian children's writer and master of the purity of the mother tongue, Laris Nice, called for the removal of “the Russian-language product and the Moscow language” from Ukraine.
To do so, it offers a Ukrainian product - a “cultural wave, a cultural push”.
Nice shared her views on the “advisability of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian edition of the “Observator”.
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is already eating and is continuing to develop.
In time, the Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language," she's convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that the Russian language had been used extensively on television and radio, but that there was little public space left.
However, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities that prohibit the use of the Russian language are, in her view, only “extension of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
In the past, Nice shared her experience of maintaining the “Ukrainian-speaking regime” at the Carpathian Children's Camp, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watsons bookshops, one of which had been in contact with her in Russian.
Without getting what it was, Nice threw the change at the girl.
The use of the Russian word by the Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia," calling on the Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in the name.
Nice recently claimed that the name "Rose" had been stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not escape the anger of the writers: by coming and hearing the staff talk to each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left with the door shut.
During the break, a man's conversation was held, and it worked out.
"The Urala" defender, Denis Kulakov, was the winner of the "Arsenal" (2:1) in the 9th round of the Russian championship.
"Denis, how do you think it was possible to win?"
"I think we wanted to win more," quotes Kulakov's official website "Urala."
"The game was so complex, and during the break they had a serious men's conversation, and it had its fruit: they beat up two balls and didn't miss it.
"You skipped a few games because of the damage you suffered at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today?"
"If it lasted 90 minutes, it's okay!
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe at the end a little bit of strength to keep it from happening.
So the doctors and physiotherapist, Vladimir Anatolijevich Koshniev, led me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
"What do you think of the atmosphere in the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after a win, it's easier to recover, and the mood in the group is good.
Now we have a white stripe, though it was black at first.
We need to keep doing this and make the fans happy."
"Did you miss the game in the time you didn't go to the field?"
"There's this, a little bored, because the real, unpleasant situation has come out.
But again, thank the physiotherapist and the doctors for getting back on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and cheered the fans.
And the rest is secondary."

In a referendum in Macedonia, violations were recorded
Four incidents of violations of the electoral law have been recorded in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental renaming treaty with Greece.
This was reported by the Spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, Tony Angelovsky, on Sunday.
Since the opening of polling stations, four incidents have been recorded, which have been resolved, he said.
At the polling station at the Lazo Angelovski Elementary School in Skopje, 22-year-old K.J. violated public order and tranquillity, insulted citizens and assaulted the police.
He was detained and taken to the police station.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all the intruders were immediately taken to the police stations.
The Ministry noted that all violations were subject to verification.
“The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can peacefully exercise the constitutional right to express their will freely.
We call upon citizens to observe the law and to refrain from any disturbance of public order and tranquillity or any violation of the secrecy of the vote,” said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
In the Sunday referendum, citizens are asked to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
On 17 June, the heads of the Macedonian and Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic at a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which runs the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
This treaty must resolve not only the multi-year dispute over the name of the country, but also open the way for Skopje to go to NATO and the EU.
Head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Russia ' s decision to deliver C-300 is a timely step
Russia's decision to deliver anti-aircraft missile systems (ZRC) C-300 to Syria is a timely step.
This view was expressed by the head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, in an interview with the RT TV channel, which aired on Sunday.
If we analyse the importance of protecting the Syrian sky, we will see that this is a sign of security and stability, not of war.
I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very grateful for Russia's efforts in this regard,” the Minister noted.
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that the C-300 was a defensive system, not an offensive system, and it was designed to protect the Syrian sky.
Pashinian hopes to hold early elections to the Parliament of Armenia in 2018
Elections to the Parliament of Armenia can take place as early as 2018, the Prime Minister of the country, Nicolas Pashinian, said.

Nicolas Pashinian added that early elections are “the demand of the people,” as well as part of the Government's programme, which the Parliament voted for.

The charges against the Dagestan MP are news.
The Sovjet Regional Court of Mahachkala held for two months a member of the Dagestan People ' s Assembly, Rajab Abdulatipov, suspected of being a member of a criminal association that constituted disability for bribes.
The "Oz" came to know the details of the investigative material that shed light on how, according to the Russian Examining Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the Republic, Ramazana Abdulatipov, Rajab Abdulatipov, had now facilitated criminal action by the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Investigation, Magomed Mahachev, and his associates.
Among other things, in the course of the investigative and operational activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied Magomed Mahachev for the post of head of the Bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles.
In the past, the investigation of Magomed Mahachev, the other leaders and members of the territorial medical and social experts' offices under his authority has led to a criminal case under article 210 (creating and participating in a criminal association using official status), article 290 (receipt of bribes by an organized group), article 292 (office fraud) and article 159 (special fraud) of the Criminal Code.
According to the investigation, in late 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Mahachev and his associates involved in theft of the Pension Fund, joined their activities by joining the criminal community.
While in the position of Head of the Department of the Federal Migration Service of Russia for Dagestan, and having links in State authorities and law enforcement structures, as well as with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, the investigators consider that “he provided for the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with State officials to support the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his position as head of the federal penal institution, the Chief Bureau of the Medical and Social Investigation of the Republic of Dagestan, organized the illegal identification of persons with disabilities”.
Following the announcement of this information at the meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov denied the charges against him.
"Of course, everything I'm charged with today is new to me, I'm not familiar with it at all," he said.
The court did not arrest a member of the “Union Russia” for 10 days before the indictment, as was the case with the previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for a period of two months, as article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation appeared in his case.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time for the prosecution of an investigation, up to 45 days from the moment of arrest.

He is the leader of Zenit, who earlier on September 30, was the first to fail in the season, from the Mahachkalinian Ange.
Spartacus, who scored 15 points, takes the fifth line.
The President of Serbia wants to ask Putin for his support
The President of Serbia, Alexander Vuccic, will discuss the situation of Kosovo with a Russian colleague, Vladimir Putin, and ask for his support during the meeting in Moscow.
The President of Serbia, Alexander Vuccic, will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
During the meeting, he plans to discuss the current situation in Kosovo with a Russian counterpart.
In addition, Wuchich intends to ask for Putin's support.
The Serbian leader made a statement during a press conference, transmitting a local newspaper, The Evening News.
According to the source, the head of Serbia clarified that, in referring to the need for Russian support, he was not referring to military support following the example of Syria.
Alexander Vuccic stated that he did not want to allow a scenario in which any major military confrontations might take place in the territory of a State.
The President of the country has promised to do his best to keep the peace, and he will deliver the edition.
In addition, according to the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for Tuesday, 2 October, and writes "Lenta.ru".
The day before, it was reported that the Serbian President had put the State army on full alert because of the situation in Kosovo.
This is the case last Friday, when a number of dozens of Kosovo's Special Forces entered the area adjacent to the lake supplying water to the Gazivode hydroelectric plant.
It is clear that the hydroelectric power station is located on the territory of Kosovo, but that it is part of the Serbian power system.
Let us recall that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia 10 years ago, but in Belgrade it was not accepted.
Last spring, the parties ended negotiations on the issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia was almost non-existent
The head of the Federation Council Committee for International Affairs, Constantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a success for Russia, and does not rule out that it will be a turning point in the way the Russian Federation views as an integral part of the solution to global problems.
“The uniqueness of the present 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric that we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been more depressing,” said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation had sometimes “noted as one of the three major threats to humanity, but, in addition to the Ebola fever, Russia had been in that category, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which had expressed itself in a very unanimity in that regard”.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed that “the subject of Russia was virtually non-existent”.
"If you carefully analyse the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at any rate, the choir was not quite accurate," the politician pointed out that Russia "was no longer a wall that the tennis ball is training about."
The head of the Sovfed substantive committee does not rule out that this shows a trend that, in his view, “will single out the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may manifest itself in full in a year, in two, three”.
“I do not rule out that the current session may in some way be a turning point,” Kosachev admitted, explaining that “there are too many examples of how Russia’s involvement can move forward in international affairs.”
He gave an example of the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“Unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will be needed over time,” added the Parliamentarian.
This is due to the fact that he believes that there is “an adequate, healthy view of Russia as not just a possible — an integral part in the solution of the global problems of our time”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have the feeling that we're going through a point somewhere that won't be moving backwards, it's going to be moving forward," he added.
Another “intriguing and important feeling” in this context Kosachev called “the request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I have attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly] Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, and I have met with great pleasure, and I have seen that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian view, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, in large part, no one was interested, the situation is different,” said the Chairman of the Sovfed Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order that represents the West has no answers to the question of how to deal with the world's problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the problems of migration”.
“And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more evident,” he expressed his confidence, emphasizing that in this sense he considers “the current session is a good one for the Russian delegation, a good one for Russia.”
The Orphan finished last at the Russian Grand Prix "Formula 1"
That's a great score for Max.
Given that he's started at number 19!

Bottas is on the side looking indignant, I guess.
In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that military force will not have to be used in the Syrian province of Idlib, said the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
Syria, he said, had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had an opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the withdrawal of the militants from the demilitarized zone in Idlib by the Russian-prohibited organization Jebhat al-Nusr, reports the RIA News.
The head of MIDA also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of Euphrates if the Kurds were to seek separatism.
At the same time, Muallem believed that the talks with the Kurdish SDF forces had been good until the US interrupted.
On 17 September, Putin and the President of Turkey, Recep Erdoğan, agreed to establish by 15 October a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.
It was previously reported that a 37-year-old defender had been negotiating a move to the Moscow Spartacus.
According to the RT, with reference to Mirror, former captain John Terry of England led the "Chelsey" youth team.
According to the source, a well-known player who has long been a member of the London Club will lead the team at least 23 years of age.
It is noted that at the coach's headquarters, Terry will replace Jody Morris, who left for Durby County.
To recall, in September, Terry was close to moving to the Moscow Spartacus, but eventually gave up the idea after talking to his family.
The first vice-speaker of the Supreme Council, Irina Gerashchenko, apologized to a convicted person in the Russian Federation for “spionage” by a Ukrainian journalist, Roman Sushchenko, for not being able to release him.
She said this in a video address to a political prisoner on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko FSB.
According to her, in those days, an action was taking place under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, in which the participants had protested with hunger, demanding the release of the prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural leaders, among them, some who know you well, are starved to support Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and, of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview, no interview, no place for the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian power, all of us, to demand pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one claim: the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all the political prisoners of the Kremlin, and those who are illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbassa and Crimea,” said Heraschenko.
It also expressed confidence that the tests would kill every Ukrainian, making us “more bitter, harder in the defence of Ukraine's national interests, in the protection of every Ukrainian, in the understanding of what is good and what is evil”.
Recall that the correspondent of Ukrinform in France, Roman Sushchenko, was arrested by Russian Sylvies on September 30, 2016 at Moscow Airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with spying on the General Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years of maximum security, and the Supreme Court of Russia found the verdict to be lawful.
The Russian prison guards granted the last request of the Ukrainian prior to his stage in the colony.
NASA reported an asteroid approaching the Earth the size of Big Ben.
The American Space Agency NASA reported that a major asteroid SP1 is approaching the Earth, which can be as long as 160 m.
According to the Daily Express, a space object can exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or the London wheel of view.
However, the exact size is not yet available.
The speed with which SP1 is moving is about 60,000 km/h. The lowest distance between the asteroid and the Earth will be on October 3.
Then it will pass by our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first spotted on 19 September.
NASA listed it as a near-Earth object.
Earlier, on September 27, Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency published the first ever video from the Rugu asteroid's surface.
It was possible to extract a unique frame from the Hayabusa-2 probe by two Japanese Rovers.
The wrinkles of the football lawn of the CM-2018 stadium were attributed to Baste
The damage to the football lawn in the Rostov-on-Donu stadium was linked to a concert by Russian rapper Vasily Vaculenko, or Basta.
Photo published at the Instagram account hd7tv.
"We're very good at Basta and his art, but... sorry for the lawn," says the signature to the photos.
The comments state that the protective coating (special tiles) caused damage to the grass at the edge of the field.
The concert, scheduled to be held on 29 September, was never cancelled.
The Rustov Football Club, as well as the Russian Prime League, opposed the concert.
"I want to know the names of the football players and Rostov, who claim that my speech can cause harm, hinder the operation and development of the football club, as well as affect the performance of its players," Basta wrote in response to criticism.
Rostow Arena is one of the stadiums of the World Cup (2018).
It held five tournaments.
Putin congratulated Hamilton on winning the Russian Grand Prix "Formula 1"
On Sunday, 30 September, Russian President Vladimir Poetin awarded the winner of the 16th stage of the Formula-1 race to the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi, British Lewis Hamilton.
Prior to the award ceremony, the Russian leader spoke briefly with the pilot of the Mercedes team in the waiting area, where he congratulated him for his victory, reports Interfax.
Hamilton had previously won the Sochi season in 2014 and 2015.
The Russian Grand Prix "Formula 1" takes place on the Sochi Autodrome on September 28-30.
The agreement with the group of companies, Formula-1, provides for the Russian Grand Prix races to take place every year from 2014 to 2025.
"I couldn't even hold a spoon."
Wahtang Kikabidze for the Control of Cancer
Many artists are now talking about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, spares no one, and the stories of popular people about winning cancer give hope to many sick people.
A prominent actor, Wahtang Kikabidze, admitted that he was only alive because of his wife.
Years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
"I feel like I've been hit with a hammer down my head.
I fell.
Lost his focus.
Put it in the hospital.
There the spoon could not hold, could not stand, fell all the time.
They started doing tests, it turns out it's bad, the artery won't miss the blood.
They brought me to Moscow, and they said that I had a big filth cyst in my head, and they had an urgent operation.
And during the operation, the doctors after the cyst saw a tumor," he said in the "One Day" program.
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say good-bye to the idol at his doorstep.
But the actor's wife didn't let a live actor be buried, and she believed that she would be able to deal with the disease and had not left bed for over a year.
If it weren't for Irina, I'd be dead right now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, she was there like a rock," the actor confessed.
The actor managed to deal with the disease, and now he lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumours of his illness, and of the untimely death that ever happens on the Internet.
The creators of the Peacemaker site added Peter Siyarto, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, to the “Purgatory” section.
The motive was “the attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the neighbouring country was found guilty of “direct threats of invading Ukraine” and “support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine” as well as of “participation in the organization of a provocation aimed at mass violations by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian law”.
Let's point out that the vice-president of Kievo Pecher's Lavra Pavel and the leader of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) Onufriy had come to Cijarto's.
The reason was their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian subsidiary Church.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine in Zakarpatia, the President of Ukraine, Peter Porosenko, demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
The authorities have named the sum of the Golden parachute of the Voronese Zangoburner.
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronesh Region, Yuri Agibalov, was made under the Regional Public Service Act.
However, the real sum of the golden parachute released from the office of the Vrio official was several times lower than the sum reported in the media.
Such explanations were provided by the regional government press service.
According to the law, the salary for the office of Agibalov is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, in the press service, the lump sum was 223,892 roubles less the income tax, rather than the 1 million roubles that the media had written about.
He received an old-age pension from July 2018.
He has been in public office for more than nine years.
This pension and a lump sum are awarded to him as soon as he is dismissed from office and explained to RIA News in the region's government.
At the same time, the payment of Aguilowa ' s pension supplements was suspended when appointed to the public service, and his salary was unchanged from the previous period.
The winner of the Governor's election, Vrio, the governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, took office on 15 September.
Aguibalov was released on the expiry of the term of office of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, the Telegram Channel, Nezigar, published documents that showed that Agibilov, who had left the position of vice-governor, had paid 23 salaries in termination indemnities, and two days later, he had again received a similar post without a "Vrio" post.
Member of the State called on the school to tell the school about the harm of masturbation
Onshchenko holds the post of First Vice-Chairman of the Education and Science Committee.
On the basis of his experience, he noted in an interview that young people are provoking harmful information on the Internet.
The fight is at the level of educational institutions and the family, and the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, MP of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with Radio Voice of Moscow):
As part of the general sex education of children, it is necessary to do so by explaining the harm, because there is a risk to the sexual health of the child, both male and female.
The problem is objective, it is that the children's ripening is early enough, and there are large scissors between their puberty and the possibility of formal contact between the sexes.
Oneshchenko is of the view that the problem is hampered by “faithfulness”, silence on “sexual age” and a lack of a culture of adequate parenting of children.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers face masturbation.
It is the view of the MP that the most important way to learn about the harm of masculinity is in schools in hyperurbanized regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, you and I will simply not understand, to put it mildly," the professor said.
Gennady Onishchenko is an active RAMN Academy, a member of the Bureau of RAMN, a doctor of medical science, a professor.
A well-deserved doctor of Russia and of Kirgistan, member of the Bureau of the national public organization, the League of Health of the Nation.
The families of the victims in Ishmilovsk will be helped by the "Technology"
The warmth will provide assistance to the families of the victims when the pipe breaks in the Ismail Prospect.
The family was told about it in the company right after the tragedy.
Recall that the pipe in the yard of the house on the Ismaila Prospect occurred on 28 September.
As a result of the tragedy, a number of cars fell under asphalt, and two young men died on the spot of burns.
ADH became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" scores another record of popularity, and Angel Merkel's ratings drop.
It seems that the Germans have become seriously tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which has made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most evident in recent social surveys, according to which the anti-immigrant party “Alternative for Germany” is getting more popular, and the positions of the ruling Merkel and Zeehofer bloc are getting weaker.
This week, the ADG broke another record with the second line of popular sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent popularity managed to bypass social Democrats, who had about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be summed up as a statistical error, but one cannot help but note the fact that the 2013 ADH of a small group of economists has become a major political force.
The leadership of the general set-off has so far continued to hold the HCC/HDZ ruling block, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards the loss of points - as early as April, the support for the Angela Merkel bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans are in support of Angela Merkel, a 7 percent lower than last year.
In addition, the social Democrats are followed by the green (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The party "Alternative for Germany" was formed in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative Choice 2013", which included members of the Christian-democracy Union.
The group was initially opposing the government course, but in the first place it dealt only with economic issues, including the euro and EU cooperation.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's “supportion” of weak EU economies, not excluding the possibility of a return to the German stamp and a complete exit from the EU.
As the immigration crisis deepened, the ADG political platform expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took over the euro-skeptics and began to criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the ADH was able to make the first entry into the Bundestag, with 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternatives for Germany" get a seat in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist who called the Ukrainians a "intimate of idiots"
The host of a political talk show on the Ukrainian TV, the author of two books, Ossp Drosdov, on the live air, confessed that he considered his countrymen to be a "stupid thing."
They believe in TV and don't read much.
As Drosdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We haven't been taught a culture of reading or accepting text since we were a kid," said the journalist.
The local nationalists immediately criticized Drosdov for his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Television and Radio Broadcasting Committee of the Independent People ' s Republic of Korea has begun to combat literature, which contains the slightest hints of criticizing the Kyiv authorities by prohibiting the import of as many as 201 editions.
Manchester City beat Briton and went to lead the APL.
In the seventh round of England's Manchester City championship, Briton won a score of 2:0 in his field.
Rahim Sterling and Sergio Aguero, the winners of the meeting, scored for the 29th and 65th minutes, respectively.

Canadians made a car in case of apocalypse - a driving magazine
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Rochel Defence Solutions stated that it had already accepted applications for its new armor.
Rochel Senator APC Apocalypse Armored
On the theme of the apocalypse, money is not just made by video games, video studios, and book publishers.
A new niche is now being developed by car companies.
For example, the Canadian Rosel Defence Solutions presented its armored armor of the Senator APC.
In time-free, this company's engineers are building armored vehicles for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are not very comfortable, but are fully securely positioned in a complete bronze capsule.
This bunker, or otherwise, is not a design, because it meets the B7 standard, is installed on the chassis of a strong Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its bottom, also armored, is capable of protecting the capsule from the impact of grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Rochel Senator APC Armored Salon
In order to prevent passengers from being harmed even by the blast from a bomb exploded next to the car, the car’s cabin is equipped with special depreciating chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
The Rochel Senator APC is equipped with a camera system with a night vision function as well as an inspection armored tower on the roof.
No weapons in the car.
Front side of the armored apocalypse Roschel Senator APC
In order not to affect the mobility of the armoured car, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbo-diesel engine of 6.7 litre, the full power of which is transferred to the four wheels of the armoured vehicle through a 6-step automatic gearbox.
There's no chance of getting stuck at all in the armored apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
A special exhibition in Washington, D.C., will be held in October to see the armor of the Roshel Senator APC.
Named the time of death of the universe
The universe is still about 140 billion years old, 10 times the age of the world’s observable, about 13.8 billion years.
A study by an international team of scientists is posted to the electronics library arXiv.org and is being published in the Journal of the Astronomical Society of Japan, as reported by the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
This was the case with the HSC camera of the Subaru Telescope in about 10 million galaxies.
Having tracked the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the world's observed energy, scientists, working under the standard cosmology model CDM ( > Cold Dark Matter), rated the expansion of the universe, which was a bit slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Subaru observatory noted that observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, while the European Space Telescope Planck's data capture clarified the limits imposed on the parameters of CDM.
In July, scientists modelled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments to the effect that the world under review would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the big gap.
Another attempt to merge the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to learn the people's opinion on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A general federal action group meeting against the raising of the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of the 13 sub-groups that had recorded different language (the Centre had recorded five).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single action group and to ask the Russians, "Would you like the age set by the pension legislation as of 1 July 2018, at which the Russians are entitled to an old-age pension, not to be raised?"
This language was registered by a sub-group of water, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the most simple and legal vessel.
The majority of the participants in the meeting were supporters of the member of the Fair Russia, Ilya Sviridov (six sub-groups) and the PRRA (four sub-groups).
Three independent sub-groups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg, joined.
In the past, Sviridov said to the “Reports” that the invitations had been sent to all initiators and that some 40 sub-groups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, head of the sub-group of water (her formulation was supported by another 15 sub-groups), said, "References," that the invitation had not been received or planned to come, "We didn't know who the friend was and who the enemy was."
Blues singer Otis Rush died
At the age of 84, the famous Chicago blues guitarist and singer Otis Rush died, reporting to AP with a reference to his manager Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following a stroke in 2003.
Mr. Rush's creativity had an impact on musicians like Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.
He was well-known in 1956 after the release of the song "I Can't Quit You Baby", which took the sixth line of the Billboard R&B rating.
"Admiral" has caused us great problems.
Zinatulla Bileletdinov: "Admiral" has caused us great problems.
Chief coach "Ak Barsa" Zinatula Biletdinov summed up the score of the regular KHL match against "Admiral" (4:2).
"The hard game was, complicated.
The rival fought well, caused us great problems.
I'm glad we played well in most of us today.
I've already told you that someday the hollows will come, and that's all we need to do is work on it.
And that we won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this episode?"
"We have our own program that it works on.
That's why it was a decision," quotes the club's Billalettin Press Service.
Ilon Musk will leave the position of head of the board of directors of Tesla
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk will be required to leave the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
At the same time, the businessman will retain the position of Chief Executive Officer of the company, reporting to the AFP with reference to the regulator's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Previously, the regulator had sued Ilon Musk - officials thought he had misled Tesla's investors, because the businessman had allowed the buy-in of all the company's shares at a high price of $420 for paper.
In the Loko-Ahmat match Turbine's mistakes fell out of the ear of abundance.
A former all-union judge, Vladimir Levitin, commented on the work of arbiter Eugenius Turbine in the 9th round of the Russian Locomotive, "Ahmat", and dealt with the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you judge Eugenius Turbine in the Locomotive-Ahmat match?
- I believe this arbiter has confirmed that he is unfit for trial by the Russian Prime League.
I am amazed that the impulses of the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dinamo", not Turbine himself, nor the leaders of the DSI, have come to serious conclusions about his low skill.
The result had not slowed down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of brutal techniques had been splintered like a horn of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute, the railroadman, Eder, is hurling his hands in his penalty square, the defender of the "Achmata" Rodolfo.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbine doesn't put a penalty.
- How do you rate the episode of Idov's involvement, which was at the 82nd minute, when it seemed like the ball hit his hand?
- I believe it was a deliberate hand-playing by a lawyer in his penalty square.
Turbin was right next to the moment, and he can see the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by reserve Judge Sergei Karasev.
Still, all three fell asleep, and the penalty was not set.
So the score in the match was distorted, and the sports justice was shattered.
It was the very case of the court of law being replaced and buried by the sporting spirit of the game.
- At the 52nd minute Turbine did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest defender, who had broken the rules in the fight against Krikhovyak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he was applauded.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second mustard?
- Turbine and the first yellow card didn't show up on the case at this point.
The second one would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of justice, that some teams are being punished for violations like the Idova episode, and some of them aren't.
What do you value from a football player?
- Depends on what it means by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give it to me.
So the arbiter won't give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge watches who's playing.
Here he was playing the Locomotive on Saturday, and Ahmat had serious concerns about Turbine's work because the team had been compromised.
Matt Damon played the man charged with raping Judge Cavanaugh at the start of the SNL.
American actor Matt Damon was a candidate for the United States Supreme Court of Britta Cavanaugh, who is charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season "Saturday Night Live" on NBC.
In a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at the Senate hearing on charges of rape.
A candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotionality and the details of his stories in an interview with Senator Amy Clobushar.
For example, Cavanaugh repeatedly confessed to his love for beer, but stated that he had never been drunk to sleep.
Moreover, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin at that time.
Damon also beat those moments.
All I did was drink a lot, and I didn't think about sex at all.
I was the most proud, drunken virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows it," said the judge in Matt Damon's service.
Cavanaugh had previously been elected the highest judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found her cloned dogs bizarre in behavior.
The American singer Barbra Streisand claimed that the clones of her dead dog were very different from the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [clons] look like her, but it's impossible to clone a soul," stressed a 76-year-old singer.
In late 2017, Straisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old coton-de-tulear dog, named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua dog called Miracle Millie, the world's smallest dog, was cloned for the 49th time.
Professionals are trying to clone a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The US was thinking about Russia's maritime blockade because of oil and gas supplies
In the US, Russia’s maritime blockade can begin to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The American authorities are so determined to fight for success in the world hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the Russian maritime blockade, which remains one of the world’s major energy suppliers.
Ryan Zinke, head of the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs, told us about the possibility of a sea siege the day before.
Contrary to global practice, the American Ministry of the Interior does not perform police functions, but civilian functions, including natural resource policies.
Therefore, Zinke's statement was well within the competence of the agency that led it, although it was not devoid of a political colour.
Addressing an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zink said that the US Navy controlled the maritime routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
From Zinke’s words, it was clear that the need might be linked to Washington’s desire to hinder Russian supply to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a lion’s share of its revenues from the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main motive for Moscow's revitalization in the region, I believe Zinke.
The minister has made it clear that the US is still looking to lead the world's energy market, becoming the largest oil and gas provider.
To do so, Washington will have to stifle Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes - an acceptable measure on the road, Zinke believes.
The Kalmian director got good reviews of the festival.
Our countryman, actor Evgeny Sangagjiyev, and his film "Harmony" were given special mention of the members of the sixth debut festival "Movement", held in Omsk.
The name of the festival diploma states that "this is a signal for the immediate response of the major industrial players in the film."
As is well known, the picture of a young Kalmian director was presented in the short film program "Movement, Beginning", where eight filmmakers took part.
The main award in this competition programme was a picture of "Yana is Anja vice versa" - the director's debut of the actress Yana Glady.
The focus of the National Film Festival for the Debut of the "Movement" is on a young movie, but not on the age of the casters, but on the state of their spirit, will and ability to risk.
And a graduate of the Eliistin Academy of Arts, P. Chonguszov and RATI-GITISA Yevgeni Sangajeev, meets all of these requirements.
He's young, talented, creative, and in his creativity, he's looking for new, innovative forms of self-expression.
Over 300 Syrians left the Idlib de-escalation zone in 24 hours
The Idlib de-escalation zone in Syria left 301 people, including 141 children, 24 hours a day, reported on the evening of 29 September at the Warring Party Reconciliation Centre.
The evacuation took place through the humanitarian corridor of Abu al-Duhr.

The islanders are being called for a quick shot - MK Sahalin
In the Sakhalin region, a campaign is under way to immunize the population against flu.
In the island region, health professionals call on residents to be more active and not to ignore the advice of doctors.
Vaccination is expected to reach 219,000 people this year, including at least 70 per cent of all children.

According to health professionals, children in six months, transport workers, educators and health-care professionals, and those most in contact with a large number of people are at the risk of “taking the disease” more.
All of them can give free flu shots.
Nor do people with chronic illnesses, pregnant women and students pay for the injection.

Supersonic passenger aircraft in the Russian Federation will be placed for production in series
The series production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
The Director-General of the Central Aerodynamic Institute of Zhukovsky Kirill Sipalo said that.
He said that the Centre was working on supersonic issues, both in international consortia and in cooperation with the Minpromtoria.
"As we feel, it will take us two to three years to get a technology displayer, as well as 10 to 15 years to get a series machine that allows for transport over the margins of our home country," he added.
He clarified that the question now before Russian experts is how to make technology cost-effective and safe at the same time.
At the beginning of September, the PAO developer, Tupolev, announced the completion of the pre-project work on a supersonic passenger aircraft, and it is estimated that the aircraft will be able to develop a speed of up to 1,900 km/h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was reported by the Deputy Director of Valery Solozov.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, thanked the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, for making Ukraine more European.
He announced it on CNN.
He stated that he could only confirm the words of the columnist Washington Post that Putin’s aggression against Ukraine had led to the unification of Ukrainians.
"In 2013, the trans-Atlantic integration of Ukraine, joining NATO, supported 16% of the Ukrainians.
Now it's over 54%.
Who did this?
Putin.
In 2013, European integration of Ukraine and EU accession supported 33% of Ukrainians.
It's 74%.
Who did this?
Putin," said Poroshenko.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more ready to defend European and trans-Atlantic values.
And we are absolutely sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire,” stressed the President of Ukraine.
In late September 2018, President Peter Poroshenko was in the United States and participated in the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly.
He also visited the grave of a great friend of Ukraine, Senator John McCain of the United States (1987-2018).

Form 1 Russia's Grand Prix
There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former captain of the Chelsey and the England team, John Terry, about why he had attended the 9th round of the Russian "Spartake" - "Rostov" (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club I'm following.
I've been following it very recently, and I was curious to see it from the outside.
I can't say I'm a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsey, but I have a sympathy for Spartacus, and I want to apologize again for the decision, and that's what Terry said on the Chelsey fan website.
To recall, the "Rostov" with 18 points went up to number three in the tournament table, and the "Spartacus" was placed on line five, with 15 points in the asset.
On the next round, the red-and-white on 7 October will play with Enicey, and the wards of Valeria Carpin will accept Orenburg the day before.
The dear violin was taken to the pawn shop for a priceless price.
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan, in Somerville, Massachusetts, for an old and unimaginable tool, a pawn shopman offered only $50.
But the experienced manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an old-fashioned and expensive tool, and asked the expert for advice.
And that's where it turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Gallano, and is valued at $250,000.
The violin only is estimated to be between $16,000 and $18,000.
The investigation found that the violin was recently taken from a resident of the city, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet clear how the violin got to the man who handed it over to the pawnshop, but he was not the subject of any previous confrontations with the law.
The manager says that everyone who brings the violin to the pawn shop will be asked to play it to make sure it's actually the client's.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are facing a thrilling stand-off: "Spartacus" will receive at its Stadium in Tushin "Rostov" under the leadership of Valeria Carpin, a man known to be no stranger to the "people's team."
The fact that clubs now have an equal score of 15 points, and they divide 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, lagging behind the far-springing Zenita, and being in the same cell as the Red-Dar who's playing with Dinamo tomorrow.
The red-and-whites are in a tough spot right now: the club is back surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly crashed "Rapidou," and recently gave way to the house "Ahmata."
After the Derby with the CSKA, which ended with a fair tie, Spartacus played the Black Sea Cup with a minimal score, and it is too early to say if Russia's most popular club is getting close to the crisis.
"Rostov" three games in a row couldn't win, but he didn't know any defeats for five.
Let's see if Carpin can continue the win-win series with such a principled match.
The previous meeting between the Karpin Rostov and Spartacus ended in favor of the Metropolitan Command.
It starts at 7:00.
Indonesia is shaken by the aftershock after a powerful tsunami
In Indonesia, where an earthquake a few days ago triggered a three-metre tsunami, meteorologists observe more than 170 aftershocks.
The Magnetuda was 7,4, most of it affecting the island of Sulawesi, reporting Russia 24.
The number of deaths exceeded 420, and more than 500 were injured.
The authorities alerted the population to the tsunami threat in advance, but later cancelled it.
The thing is, the instruments didn't detect the coming of the wave.
So far, the fate of the dozens of people who have been preparing to celebrate a national holiday on one of the shores of Palau, which was the most devastated by the natural disaster, is unknown.
London has been accused of Moscow.
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the Cold War, as British Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
More and more threats, Iran and North Korea are becoming more and more dangerous, and enemies are operating in gray areas with cyberattacks and false news, added the Minister.
But the biggest one is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians have been repeatedly denied by Moscow, and they have been transmitted to the TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt referred to the poisoning in the British city of Salisbury in March this year, ex-colonel Sergey Scripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum to join the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute with neighbouring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first votes was made by Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, a fervent supporter of the renaming of the Republic to North Macedonia.
The preparations for the referendum and today's vote are monitored by international organizations.
The head of the observer mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers was organized:
Some 100 teams have been deployed throughout the country to monitor the process today, from the opening of polling stations to the closing of polling stations, to the counting of votes and the drafting of protocols.
For a month, 10 of our teams have been working in the country to monitor the preparations for the vote, the media, the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgeri: "Around 500 foreign observers are following the voting closely.
The observer teams shall record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the electoral commissions in order to present them in the final report.”
Translator compared the mentality of the Russians to the Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the small differences between them do not play a major role in understanding.
On 30 September, the International Translator's Day was told by a professional interpreter-synchronist, Bärbel Sakse.
She has been in the field of translations from Russian and English for over 30 years.
"The Germans love to plan things quietly, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "have a long time, let's go fast."
But I think it's not a big deal for understanding among nations and for the work of an interpreter," said the expert in the comment "RIA News."
According to the interpreter, in order to understand that the two countries need to know each other's history.
And in the future, Saxe said, Germany has no point in ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are a lot of things that determine our common destiny," she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country was trying to “link” and maintain relations with Russia.
She said that the Northern Flow 2 project, which is built from the coast of Russia to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is particularly important for Berlin.

Putin appointed a new Head of the Office of the President for Foreign Policy
Volodymyr Poetin was exonerated by decree from the office of Chief of the Office of the President for Foreign Policy.
He was replaced by Igor Neverov.
Mr. Manjosin has been in charge of the Office of the President for Foreign Policy since 2004.
One of the reasons for his departure from the Kremlin was that the “OJ” source referred to personal circumstances, noting that there were no significant claims for the quality of the work under the head of management.
Igor Neverov was previously head of the Second European Department of MIDA.
In 2009-2014, he was a Russian ambassador to Sweden.
The Russians donated one rouble for a low-wage MP
In Yekaterinburg, the People's Charitable Foundation opened a fund-raiser for a member of the State Duma Vera Gansi, who complained of low wages.
The campaign can be tracked on the website of the organization.
"The Human Charity Foundation" expresses the hope that the whole world will be able to save the people's servant.
Let's ask all interested people to give us a chance to live and a happy future!
All the funds collected will be transferred to the poor in person.
God save you!" said the fund.
All the charities want to collect 380,000 roubles for the MP, which is the equivalent of a month's salary.
The reports of the assistance received are published on the Vkontakte page of the fund, where the organisers produce screenshots of remittances.
The most frequent sums are one rouble and 50 kopecks.
At the time of the release of the note, the Russians had donated 1633 rubles to Vera Ganza.
The fund-raising opened on 28 September following a low-income complaint by Ganzi.
According to her, the average salary of the deputy is 380,000 roubles, from which nothing is left, so it is necessary to spend money on a credit card.
Ganjia visited that parliamentarians were not compensated for hospitality.
Subsequently, the State Duma stated that it would consider the possibility of paying representation to the deputies.
"The Golden Sculpture" of the San Sebastian Festival received a film "The Interface of the Two Seas"
The picture "Entre dos aguas" by the Spanish director Isaki Lacuesta was recognized as the best film of the 66th International Film Festival in San Sebastian.
The tape won the main award of the festival, the Golden Spin.
The Norwegian actress Pia Tielt won the Silver Spin Award as the best actress behind the tape "Blind Spot".
The best actor was named Darrio Grandinetti, an Argentine for the film "Red" (Rojo).
The director of the same film, Benhamin Ney state, was ranked as the best director.
The comedy "The Night School" was led by an American box office.
The comedy "The Night School", which debuted in American theaters last Friday, earned $28 million for its first weekend.
This result made it possible for Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the United States box office from 28 to 30 September.
On the international market, the film, so far released in only 20 countries, has raised $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the fight for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable, has been quite apprehensively ahead of another Western-rent novelist, a cartoon called "Smolfoot", a curious history of a charming Bigfoot to a man whose existence the main character never believed in.
The Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reysig's project of directors raised 23 million dollars for their start-up weekends, meeting the overall expectations of the experts who predicted 20 to 25 million for the weekend.
In the case of Smolfoot's total fee, it is currently $38.6 million (and it debuted in 50 countries), the most active of which was Mexico, which has added $3.6 million to the film's monies.
The three most powerful this time was shut down by the children's fairy tale "The Mystery of the House with the Hours" from the horror master Eli Roth, who finally proved that the director was good at making a good movie for the audience.
In her second week of renting the John Bellers book with the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett made $12.5 million, bringing the global total to 53.8 million.
Despite the flight out of top 3, he continues to be surprised by the sign "+" thriller from Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick's "Simple request": in 17 days in the United States, a picture of Paul Fig, from which some unreal financial performance was not originally expected from the word "totally," raised $43 million (including $6.6 million for 28-30 October) and now has as much as 62.9 million in total.
The last representative of the first five this week was the Horror "The Curse of the Nonne", which raised $5.4 million over the reporting period.
Spin-of-the-art spells for 24 days in American (and not only of course) cinemas have $330 million in total and have recently been proud to be the most successful film of the franchise, which also includes two parts of the spell itself and two tapes on the horrendous doll of Annabel.
Following the horror of Corin Hardy, a second member of the genre, the debutant of the Hellfest, one of the main youth horrors of the year, was placed in the wake of the last weekend.
On his first weekend as a prominent editor (and with a recent director), Gregory Plotkin, who had previously worked for a number of large chorroror projects, including "Happy Death Day", for which Hellfest had a lot of resemblance, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is very positive.
The seventh was "The Crazyly Rich Asians" ($4,15 million), who seem to be not thinking of getting out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy that has been on the screen for the seventh week, the September top six of the highest scores in history, with a figure of 165.7 million.
This is the sum of the current picture in the domestic market, with a total of 218.8 million ribbons.
As for the last three lucky ten in the United States of America from 28 to 30 September, they were the Predator, the White Boy Rick, and the Black Mint, which earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million and 1.1 million, respectively, over the past weekend.
Let's add that next weekend in the U.S., the long-awaited Vienna with Tom Hardy, who, we can be sure of that, will take the lead in American box office on the first weekend of October.
From the next week's premiere, it's worth denoting the musical melodrama "Star Born," the winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hate."

Valery Belov: God helped Siberia today
The Chief Trainer of Vitia Valery Belov, who lost Siberia (3:4) at the regular KHL championship.
"The college was talking about the Siberian fans, and I want to celebrate our fans," the white official website "Vitze."
"I hope they'll also be supportive, 'cause now almost every game is full of stadiums, a great atmosphere.
In the game, I guess God was helping Siberia today, because it was very rudely wrong, especially our leaders.
We've lost a micro-playing 0:3 of our top leaders, so it's been hard for us to get out of this match, even though we had moments.
But still, I'll take the blame.
'Cause you must have missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team."
"It's a monstrous cummy."
The audience is resented by Agustina's choice of voice show.
The audience of Voice 60+ accuses Leonid Agustin's mentor of "devil camouflage and brazen pranks."
When in blind auditions he first learned the voice of his father, Nikolai Agutin, many had hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the performer.
But the son's feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative on his team.
At the time, many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor the partiality of the first stage.
But the joke took a long time, and the star's father took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agustina for this injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, resented the indignant and open-minded dragging our next of kin to the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutina would have the strength and the conscience not to drag his father to the end of the first place,” Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin reasoned on the TV Man.
In the meantime, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "sleed" the beautiful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovic whispered a moving song about his mom, explaining that the viewers still wanted to see his father's show.
But, as it turns out, it's not the case, the viewers want to be objective and see real talented performers in the final, and now Agustin has discredited the show.
"I'm sorry for the "Voices" members of the Agustina team - they were doomed."
"The last time Agustin showed him how much he loved dad, "and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and to leave his father in the project, who is not singing but whispering, how can you then call a mentor?"
"I like how dad sings, make him a concert in the Kremlin for your money, and see how many people will come to the concert."
It's the Voice show, not the Bloody Family show.
"It was unprofessional from Agutin's side."
"Then you have to offer your own show to pope, not the show that is made for the money of Channel One."
"This was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other actor with real Vocal data.
Why was the Surgut worker with a great voice and a tembro spilled, and the father of Agustina was led to the finals?
And then we all complain about the same faces on the stage and on the screens for decades!
It's because you can't get through the chimney!"
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
There's a round of blues and chimneys.
And it's not going to be too much money for the family budget!
The theater of absurdity continues!"
The users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voice, the son of Gradsky had come out at blind auditions.
Then it never occurred to me to take my son on my own team.
In fact, he said, "Come on, get out of here, I get it."
Agustin couldn't do as a professional.
Military Canada was allowed to wear beards to boost the spirit
The Department of Defence of Canada has issued an order that allows military personnel to wear beards.
According to CBC, the bill contains instructions for the care of the beard.
It is noted that the military may be ordered to shave “for security reasons”.
The military beard cannot be longer than 2 cm, nor must it be carefully trimmed, and the neck and cheekbones must be shaved.
At the same time, Navy personnel were allowed to wear a beard only on land.
It is expected that the innovation will “enhance the morale of the army and attract more Canadians to the service”.
The ban on wearing beards has been in effect in the Canadian army since World War II.
It was previously reported that police officers in France had also been allowed to wear beards and even to have tattoos.

In Russia, they'll start fines for violations in the field of construction.
As of tomorrow, Russia will begin to be fined for violations in the area of equity, and will be handed over by Russia 24 to Russia.
The penalty is to be imposed on companies and officials if they do not transfer the building data to the Integrated Housing Information System on time.
The innovation will help those who choose to buy an apartment in a new building but fear the builder’s bankruptcy.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for the construction industry.
Due to the amendments to the law on equity construction, the developers will have to lend full credit to the bank.
And a lot of experts have already talked about the possible high travel of apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.
In the center of Kyiv, a robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to rent money at the ATM.
The incident took place on the night of 29 September in Ivan Koudry Street, and was reported by the security guards.
According to the victim, the unsub approached him and started a conversation, but he suddenly grabbed the knife and demanded that he be given the money and the cell phone.
Since the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered the withdrawal of the money from the bank card.
After the assailant had received 4,000 hryvnias and a phone, he hit the victim and fled,” the report states.
Law enforcement managed to arrest the robber, and they turned out to be a 25-year-old Chinese.
He is now facing up to seven years of imprisonment.
The police are also working out the theory of the intruder's involvement in other such crimes.
Let me remind you, the day before, there were a number of resonant robberies in Odessa.
In one case, armed robbers were caught using a drone.
A scientist described a possible scientific programme for a Russian mission to the Moon
The head of the RAN Institute for Space Research, RAN correspondent Anatoly Petrukovic, told RIA News about a possible research programme for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was in the process of developing a course of action for such work.
"Consolidated opinion not yet," stressed the scientist.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radiotelescope on the back of the Moon, thus avoiding the interference caused by the Earth.
"This is the only place that a telescope can be deployed to explore space-derived radio-radiation sources," he added.
He also believes that the Moon could be used to test robotics, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, a scientist believes that astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on Earth.
This could help us to determine how life emerges on planets.
The head of Roscosmos had previously said that the Russian Federation was optimistic that it could fly a manned flight to the Moon by 2030.
An offended client chucked out a basket of feces at the 7-Eleven store.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old Saint-Petersburger, known as Florida, had a tooth on the manager of a 24-hour 7-Eleven store: in May, he kicked him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
So he decided to avenge his enemy in the original way.
At half-second of the night, he entered the store and threw it on the floor and on some of the items on the shelves the contents of the basket.
The basket contained faeces and urine that Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile biota.
The police who arrived at the scene arrested the "Avenger."
He was put in prison and released on bail at $300.
He was charged with illegal intruding and criminal offences, and was not allowed to go to the store and approach the manager.
While Simms's crime looks funny rather than serious, the sentence may be rather severe, as he has repeatedly violated the law: he is the subject of large-scale theft, theft, illegal possession of weapons, drunk driving, and cruelty to animals.
In the U.S., they called Russia's most formidable sub
The most frightening enemy submarin for the US Navy will be the Russian sub-ship Kazan of the "Yasen-M" project, writes The National Interest.
The submarine was released in March 2017, but the Navy will have it in 2019.
According to the publication, even the predecessor of Kazani, the sub of Northodwinsk, was commended by the United States military.
We will face a severe potential adversary.
Just look at "Severodwinsk," quotes The National Interest Counter-Admiral Dave Johnson.
At the same time, the edition states that the United States retains an advantage in this industry over Russia.
The multi-purpose nuclear submarines Kazan, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk and Arkhangelsk are built on the "Yasen-M" project (885M).
They have a displacement of 13,800 t, a depth of 520 m, a crew of 64, an autonomy of 100 days, and an underwater speed of 31 knots.
Submarines are armed with mines, torpedoes 533 mm, Onyx and Caliber cruise missiles.
In August, U.S. Press said that the U.S. underwater force remained "the most powerful and frightening force on the planet."
German politicians ignored the opening of the mosque because of Erdogan.
The Prime Minister of the Northern Rhine-Westphalia Armin Lachet and the Oberburgmaster Celna Henrietta Recker ignored the ceremony of the opening of a new city mosque.
Deutsche Welle writes about it.
The event was attended by the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Lachet met Erdogan at Cologne Airport, but refused to go to the mosque, explaining that the event might have become a “extremely politicized event”.
Recker reported that he had received an informal invitation on the eve of the opening on Friday, 28 September.
According to her Spokesperson, such a proposal should be viewed as late and not serious.
Addressing the square in front of the mosque, Erdoğan summed up a two-day visit to Germany.
The President described them as successful, he said, and he was able to meet with the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeyer, and the Chancellor, Angela Merkel, with whom he discussed, inter alia, the fight against racism and Islamophobia.
The new mosque in Cologne has become one of the largest in Europe, with the capacity to accommodate at the same time some 1.1 thousand believers.
The construction cost 30 million euros, with funding from the Turkish side.

The BU identified and detained the owner of the Peugeot 301 car, who traveled through the capital the day before with the license plate labels of the so-called "DNR".
It turned out to be a former member of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who is currently an agent of an insurance company in Ukraine.
According to the U.S. Press Centre, the detainee explained that the car had been wanted by Interpol since 2014, and was therefore detained in Russia and handed over to him as a representative of the insurance company.
When he crossed the Ukrainian-Russian border, he removed his fake license plates, but at the time of his entry to Kyiv, he re-entered them.
He said that he had done so “to ensure that the registration number of the car package was in line with the vehicle issued by the Russian Interpol, in case the vehicle was stopped for inspection by the Ukrainian police”.
“A set of measures is currently being implemented to verify the explanations provided, as well as to determine whether it may be involved in terrorist activities,” the ISA stated.
We note that in Ukraine the use of numbers issued by terrorists in the territories of Donbassa seized by them is prohibited.
By the way, a member of the State Border Service had previously been seen on a car with a similar number in Mariupol.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia forecasts a gradual weakening of the rouble to 73.9 roubles per United States dollar for the period up to 2036.
The agency also predicts the stabilization of world oil prices in the 40-50 dollar-a-burel diapozone during this period.
This is stated in the budget system's budget portal in the Russian Federation's 2036 budget forecast.

In the United States, a possible maritime blockade of Russia was declared
The United States, if necessary, can impose a maritime blockade on Russia to prevent it from supplying energy to the countries of the Middle East.
This was stated by US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke.
Addressing an industrial event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of the department stated that the only source of income for the Russian economy was the sale of energy, and Moscow had an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas, as it did in Europe, by Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that the situation was similar to that of Iran.
In the view of the Minister, there are two options for the solution: military and economic.
He would prefer not to be the first to use, so pressure must be put on and Iranian energy must be replaced.
Russian missile launchers will conduct exercises on the shores of the Baltic Sea

There was nothing I could do, and it was very painful.
Sergei Orothkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful
The Russian pilot William's Sergey Orotkin commented on the result of the Russian Grand Prix race.
"Truly, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I ended up between the two cars that got me in the first place.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
Turned out to be in a very bad position.
I'm stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us hit the pit stop, we'd get in the clean air, and we'd get back the pace, but the rubber was gone.
Plus he was fighting his partner, and he was in contact with him, too.
I take it he's a little mistaken.
We were in this situation on the slowest track of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it any more," quotes Orokin RIA's words "News."
Let's recall that the Orotin in the race to Russia's Grand Prix finished on the 18th, and the British pilot Lewis Hamilton was the winner.
Tarpishev called it absurd to suspend Glushakov and Jenko from the base of Spartacus.
The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTP) Shamil Tarpeshchev commented on the suspension of the footballers of the Moscow "Spartak" Denis Glushakov and Andrey Jenko from training with the main members of the post-leaking team to criticize the Chief Trainer of the Massimo Carrera team, reports the "Sport Weekend".
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
It's stupid to pay attention to something like that.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the mess in the team.
First of all, it's poems, you can read and read them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted to that in Carrera's place.
Everyone's got an opinion.
Second, everyone wants to have a good time.
If Glyushakov and Jenko are liking, that doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to view the situation.
And it's not the normal climate on the team.
Today, Spartacus doesn't have a game, so it didn't have to be a big deal.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
Spartacus has a lot of inoperability in different ways, and it's a non-segregation once it's made up of young people.
The relationships within the team do not seem to add optimism before this match, "I'm sure the Tarpshawks.
The game of the two teams will take place on 30 September and will start at 7 p.m. in Moscow time.
Formerly rejected by Spartacus, John Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.
Sirius's students discussed natural-like technologies with scientists
Teachers of the Sirius Education Centre in Sochi, members of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the National Research Centre “Kurchatov Institute”.
A presentation by researchers took place as part of a programme of the Global International Forum of Convergence-like and Natural Technologies, organized in Sochi on the instructions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and is available on the website of the educational centre on 29 September.
The lecture was opened by a documentary film entitled "Courchatov's Codes", in which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, RAN correspondent Michael Kowalchuk, spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The student's lecture is published on the Syrius website.
Schoolteachers have learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet in a position to produce such volumes.
This problem, according to the organizers of the Forum, will be addressed by the natural technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of natural-like technologies, as well as the risks inherent in the development of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, a huge good.
It's an explosive increase in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's a second side.
The development of natural-like technologies is in fact the technological replication of wildlife systems.
There's the back side - targeted intervention in human activity.
There's always a risk.
There was a car, and people started to die under the wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I create medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," quotes the scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask the participants questions.
The speakers included a PhD candidate, the head of the Kurchatov Complex of the IBEX-Natural Technologies of the CIT “Kurchatov Institute” Iulia Diakov, and the head of the Kurchatov Complex of IBEX-Technologies Viacheslav Demin.
The “Sirius” educational centre in Sochi was set up by the Talant and Success Foundation, based on the Olympic infrastructure, at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the educational centre is to identify, develop and further professionally support gifted children.
Previously, in September, it was reported that the All-Russia online online digital security championships, the Cyberfruits, would be sent to Sirius for training.
A life-threatening air traffic controller rescued a plane with passengers during an earthquake in Indonesia
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller, Antonius Gunavan Agun, was pardoned, who saved hundreds of passengers from the Batik Air airline at a cost of his life.
On September 28, he worked at Palu's Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie on Sulawesi Island.
At the time of the severe earthquake, the aircraft was preparing to take off.
Agun refused to leave the control tower and helped the plane get up in the air.
When the magnetoid of swings reached 7,4, the tower began to collapse.
A 21-year-old dispatcher had to jump from a height of four.
When he fell, he suffered serious internal injuries, and the doctors failed to save him.
The Russian sub Kazan scared the US
The biggest threat to the US Navy is the Russian submarine Kazan.
American counter-admiral Dave Johnson claimed this, and he's handing it over to "Rosbalt" with a reference to The National Interest.
"We are at risk of a severe potential adversary.
All he had to do was look at "Severodwinsk," he said, pointing to the pre-model Kazani.
According to the US Navy Commander-in-Chief James Fogo in Europe, Russia has focused on modernizing its submarine.
Macedonia: No referendum due to low attendance
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country “North Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the Macedonians using the name of their historic province.
The change of name led the former Yugoslav Republic to open the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to EFE, only 34% of the Sunday plebiscite's appearances "not reached" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only of a consultative nature, the authorities in Skopje might decide not to reject the renaming.
In a speech shortly after the closure of polling stations, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zayev, a supporter of the change in the name of the Republic, said that if there was more "yes," Macedonia would change the name, despite an unattainable quorum.
"Avangard" on the outlet overplayed the Minsk Dinamo.

Kemerochan stirred up a herd of rams at the cemetery
On September 30, a well-known Kemerovo social media page received a report from an eyewitness that a local cemetery was free to walk horned animals.
A large herd of animals passed between the fence and brushed the grass.
Commentators expressed different views: some of the local residents noted that there was no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery and that their appetite might even help to clear the area from weeds and grass, but some of the city's inhabitants did not enjoy the following:
"This is a grave, not a pasture.
There's nothing for the rams to do.
Of course, you can't say that they're sacrificing, but it's not a big deal." (Style saved)
In any event, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery was already known, and action would soon be taken.
To get in and out - how is that right?
There is no word to push.
That's right. To get involved.
The word "press" in the meaning of "stress, influence, influence" exists only phonically, because we hear sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "satisfaction."
We use that word in the belief that it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "satisfaction" are not only not close, but even in some way opposing.
Make sure you do.
Length (church-book, obsolete) means "pleasant, full, sufficient, sufficient for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
Satisfaction, pleasure is kinship.
In the past, it had the meaning of "don't depend on anything, have a self-satisfactional value" - "be content with yourself."
Old-Slawish "wowl'ti" is related to the words "give" and "will."
Pushing, suppressing, it's completely different.
These words are truly frightening "natives": daos is a "wolf" (pressing sheep), deyja is a "death" and dvaid.
The analogy of the word "pressure" and "satisfaction", as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, led them to contaminate.
So we have this most "d" that is used in a letter through "a," which is, in a good way, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the creation and development of those words.
Okay, right, let's get it.
But it's an old word that's no longer in use in the right sense.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from the top, use the word "press."
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember, it's a cleric.
Russia became the leader of the EuroSkills in Budapest.
The Russian team was the leader of the EuroSkills European professional championship.
The event took place in Budapest, writing the TASS.

The team's spare is 19 decorations, including nine gold, eight silver, two bronze, and ten medallions for professionality.
Gold award holders work in the areas of visual mercenarising, graphic design, mobile robotics, hotel management, network and system administration, web design, welding, etc.
The best representative of the Russian Federation for the number of points won at the championship was the 19-year-old freelancer Mikhail Vorontsov.
The young man was awarded the Best of Nation award.
It is noted that the winners of the first race will receive a bonus of up to 700,000 roubles.
The prizes are also awarded to the championship.
The EuroSkills tournament was held in the capital of Hungary from 25 to 29 September.
Our car is much slower than the Mercedes.
Ferrari's pilot, Kimi Rykkonen, is about the qualifications of the Russian Grand Prix, which led him to fourth place.
"Kimi, did you have a chance to fight for the poul today?
How good was the car?"
"It looks like "Mercedes" was a lot quicker today, "refers to Rykkonen's words F1News.Ru.
But our car's behavior has been the best since the start of the weekend."
"In the course of your qualifications, you did not yield to Sebastian Fettel's speed, but in the end, the lag was noticeable.
What's the reason?"
"My attempt was good, but then one of the Mercedes racers was ahead.
He was getting ready to try and still managed to miss me, but it looks like I've lost some time on it.
But I don't think it had a big impact on the result."
"In Sochi, it's very hard to pass, is starting the race the key?"
"Please, yes, but you never know how it's gonna work out.
It won't be easy anyway, 'cause our car is much slower than the Mercedes."
A mass accident occurred under Tula

Russia has guarded itself from terrorists by means of an operation in Syria
In three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of whom 85,000 have destroyed the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was described on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the FAC, the head of the Federation Defence and Security Council, Victor Bondareev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-to-air weapons: the air-to-space forces had and continued to strike all the targets of the terrorists.
According to Bondarev, in three years tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria, such as ammunition depots, strongholds and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, the defense of the jihadists was hacked, making a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syria's government forces, handing over Interfax.
According to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria has also protected Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the start of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the “Islamic State” (IS, prohibited in Russia) and the “Jebhat al-Nusru” (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of the IG, some 4,000 Russians and some 5,000 citizens of the post-Soviet countries have fought, and the TASS has been handed over.
And it's only about the registered individuals, apart from those who have not been identified, that the Bondarev stressed.
Most of them have been trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports have given them the right to enter our country freely.
So, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at a far-flung point, or this evil “would come to us.”
The phones of Boris Johnson and a number of British ministers have been made public.
The personal data of a number of former and current British ministers have been made publicly available due to the security failure of the software set up by the Conservative Party, and Sky News.

According to the TV station, a number of politicians received "unpleasing calls."
The technical problem has been solved, and the use of the application is now safe.
We are studying the causes of the failure and apologizing for any problems caused,” said the Conservative Party.
During the crash, users could not only see confidential data, but also edit information in the profile of politicians and journalists.
For example, in the profile of the Minister of Environment, Environment and Agriculture, Michael Gove, his picture was replaced by a picture of the mediamagnate Rupert Murdock.
Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, accused the US and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
[West] Coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it has destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it was targeted, and it has massacred civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes," he said.
According to Muallem, the US and its partners provided “direct support to the terrorists” because the targets of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant “the sowing of chaos, death and destruction on their way”.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete, and the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intended to rid Syria of an illegal foreign presence, and that priority in the reconstruction of the country would be given to Syrian partners.

The United States rejected all charges.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, believes that, while respecting the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The Head of State announced this during his visit to Kharkov oblast, commenting on the issuance by Hungary of its passports in Zakarpatia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I am defending the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” stressed Porosenko.
According to Poroshenko, he, as president, will defend Ukrainian citizens, wherever they may be, in the east or west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the passport scandal with Hungary, which is the intention to expel the consul of that country from the coast.
"I fully share every letter that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said," noted the President.
On 19 September, according to FACTS, a video was released on the Internet recording the time of the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens at the Hungarian Consulate in the Bank of Hungary.
In doing so, they vowed their allegiance to Hungary aloud.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Paul Klimkin, pointed out that the consul of Hungary, who appeared in a video of the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, was to leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself or would be expelled by Kyiv.
It was also reported that the prosecution office of the Zakarpatia region had initiated criminal proceedings for the issuance of Hungarian passports.
The incident is classified under the heading “State treason”.

The Haqsa media suggest that Putin can accept the resignation of the head of Haqsasia and appoint a new vio to the head of the Republic, as well as make a decision on the fate of Zimin.
Putin had already visited Haqasia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the President's favorite resting places.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict in Syria for seven years.
Some five million people fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
In the view of Damascus, the military action is now nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of the refugees.
This was stated by the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem in his address to the United Nations: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government is continuing to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal.
All the conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they have had to flee because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which have made life and their means of subsistence more difficult.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to provide funds to that effect.
In the meantime, the US and the EU have refused to assist Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must be found first.
Volkswagen fully pleaded guilty to "deselgate" in January 2017.
Last December, Oliver Schmidt was sentenced to seven years in prison, one of the managers of the American branch of the company.
The contract losses are estimated at at least 25 billion euro.
This amount is not limited to fines and compensation.

For example, the management of the firm had recently changed again, as well as a major restructuring and policy change in the management system had been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy out even new cars if German cities ban diesel in their streets: this is the right of power in February this year.

Mitropolitan Ilarion compared Kyiv's decision to rename the PCP with the actions of the Fascists
The head of the Synod Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mitropolitan Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Nazis against the Jews.
"It's like, in the German fascist, putting a yellow end star on a Jew, that means labeling the Church as an enemy organization, and that's why the bill was set up," said the mythropolitan on the TV channel Russia 24 (cited by Interfax).
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at an acute stage.
Kyiv thus hopes to have complete control over the CCP and to “outlaw it”, the clergyman believes.
"This is the Church of Ukraine, and the believers of this Church think they're Ukrainian, they're patriots of their country," he added.
In the past, it has been reported that members of the Supreme Union are working on the implementation of Bills No. 4128 (on the change of subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on the change in the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the renaming of the Moscow Patriarchate ' s PCP.
The vice-president of the Pochayev laurel called for the protection of the Orthodox and Ukrainian shrines
The vice-president of St.-Uspen's Pochayev Laura, Mitropolitan Vladimir, made a call for the protection of the Orthodox faith and the Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) is published on Saturday on the website.
In different times of history, our predecessors and relatives in the faith and spirit had to profess their faith and defend their holy sites.
Given the situation, and the information we have and the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we too will have to survive,” said the Mitropolitan Police.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
The vice-president of the laurel also stressed that it is likely that "you will need your physical presence."
The minister added: "Lenin's grandchildren, by spirit, threaten to kill, so we will protect our holy place."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochayev laurel, the Orthodox Ukrainian and global shrine, needs to be prepared to defend it, says the address.
The Mitropolitan called on those who misled the believers not to go about it.
The CCP has a canonical status defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to make it dependent on the news patriarch and the Catholic Pope's friend Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is not acceptable to us Orthodox.
And we're happy with the status that our church has," noted the vice-president of the laurel.
He recalled that the CPI had been canonically independent and fully self-governing since October 1990.
There is no financial and administrative accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?" remarked the Mitropolitan Pochayevski Vladimir, calling upon the believers and all the citizens to ask whether the other Tomos have any creeds, are they independent of the Vatican?
Those who believe have sorted out a bit, and have determined to what kind of temple they should go to.
Some, however, want to sow resentment and discord.
Some are envious that the dome is shining on the temples that they want to destroy,' stressed the minister.
It is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurels are located at the top of the Postajew Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopol.
The first historical account of it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

If we keep playing the same thing right, the victories will come
He was the head coach of the Moscow "Dinamo" by Vladimir Vorobiev, who was defeated by the "Automobilist" (0:1) at the regular KHL championship.
"The good game was interesting, though it was going to the ground," quotes Sparrow's official website, "The Automobilist."
"We used to play very easy.
I really liked the first period.
We didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, we got a little stifled, we survived.
But we've been "fed" a little.
The guys played great, did the coaching setup.
I think if we keep playing the same thing right, the victories will come.
They didn't score, but with zero of the game's heads, the game was the right thing to do.
Good luck will come if we continue to play in this direction."
"In your opinion, the "Vehicle" added to the meeting in Lower Novgorod?"
"Then there was no foreign link.
At the pre-season, the teams were doing other tasks, playing a lot of young guys.
I think it was a completely different game, another hockey game.
"Vehicle" is a good team.
It's clear from the tournament table that the team is playing the right game.
Good hockey, good atmosphere in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them good luck.
The command is moving in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good gatekeeper.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
They knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but it didn't work out."

Chief Macedonian opponent refused to vote in a referendum
In Macedonia, a referendum is held on Sunday, 30 September, on the issue of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece to rename the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party “Inner Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity” (WMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mitzko, stated that he would not vote in a referendum.
As the party's Spokesman, Naum Stoilkovsky, explained, Mitzkoski decided to abstain from voting to express his opposition to a treaty that he considered “bad”.
According to the Spokesman, the current referendum addresses the issue of renaming the country, and nothing more, while the party's strategic goal is to gain membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, the President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen a name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considered the renaming of the country to be a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign State is being created with a new name," noted Ivanov.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic, the Republic of Northern Macedonia, was signed by the heads of the Macedonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Greece on 17 June of this year at a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which runs the border between the two countries.
This treaty is to resolve a multi-year dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje's journey to NATO and the EU, like the TASS.

The US is setting up an increase in the production of opiates in Afghanistan
The dramatic deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September was well-known in Tehran.
There was a multi-stakeholder consultation with Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrouchev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, the militants have waged a real terrorist war against the State authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has been a record in the number of bloody terrorist attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” said Patrouchev.
Afghanistan's troubles didn't start yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Al-Qaida terrorist group (prohibited in the Russian Federation) was declared the main enemy of the United States of America.
Not a month later, America and NATO allies began a military operation there, "An Enduring Freedom."
It's been 17 years.
The multi-thousand American contingent is now on Afghan land.
And a peaceful life is even more phantom than it was then.
The American troops are rushed behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they pay off the militants for money, so they don't get touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40 per cent, according to Patrouchev.
50 per cent in the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
10 per cent more for ISIL terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they grow up there fast.
The aim is to create a barbaric pseudo-khaliphate in Central Asia, exactly what they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be okay with that.
As well, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times over the 17 years of the American presence.
The huge growth in the area, sown by opium poppy and multi-billion-dollar profits.
The Macedonians are preparing to vote in the EU and NATO accession referenda, subject to a change in the name of the country.
An agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the result of long talks with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia, seeing in that name an attempt on the same name Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, politicologist: "Because of this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia is entitled to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will secure the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult trade-offs that cannot make everyone very happy."
The country is renamed by the ruling social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zayev.
Conservative opposition and President George Ivanov are against.
According to the journalist Clementin Chilimanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, led by Zayev, is being imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Faye Dulgary, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the greatest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice that Macedonians make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole."
