Semilarski v. the Public Prosecutor's Office: the former Vice-President Tartu's Cassation will be considered on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The courts of the first two had refused to hear the Semilarski case, but in April his appeal had been accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant, as the author ' s permission was not within his jurisdiction.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for damages in criminal proceedings.
“The Public Prosecutor's Office and the County Court are responsible for regulating such matters”, previously explained to ERR's correspondent for the Tartu Courts, Anette Kreitsmann.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed the order to the District Court, which did not change the decision of the Court of First Instance on 5 February.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's defence counsel, the juror Oliver Neyes, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now asks the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to refute the incorrect allegations against him and to compensate him for the moral damage.
The reason for the application to the court was the statements made by the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the Liuna District Attorney's Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with the other Vice-President, Tartu Artem Suvorov was arrested on suspicion of having committed a number of crimes.
“Remember, when I was arrested, the Security Police and the Public Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most powerful bodies of local self-government, were corrupt.
These public suspicions in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have been false, the Public Prosecutor's Office has no intention of saying anything about it,” comments Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyes, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the Public Prosecutor's Office was to operate.
"The claim of bribes and corruption was false, but it's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as on Lithuania that at the stage of the investigation, representatives of the State should be careful when choosing the words so that the suspects would not be represented as criminals before sentencing.
The Public Prosecutor's Office also imposes a presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, has not been respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” Neyes said.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and a briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still found to be unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant”, added counsel.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former vice-president Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted for bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, a former official is tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption law in very large transactions.
According to the indictment, from 2015 to 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than 30 times in the City Hall meetings in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, whose owners or supervisors Semilarski had been active at the personal level during the out-of-work period.
According to Gross, in all of these cases, Semilarski had a personal interest, and therefore had to be disassociated from decision-making.
Previously, as rus.err.ee wrote, the Public Prosecutor's Office had suspected Semilarski of taking bribes and violating anti-corruption laws in dealing in particularly large amounts.
This occurred in October 2016, when he was arrested along with the other Deputy Mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
At that time, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both vice-presidents.
Since then, both officials have resigned.
The Suvorov case later reached the court, which fully justified the policy.
The trial of Valvo Semilarski is still under way.
The ex-soldier of the group "The Hands Up" visited Tver oblast
The ex-soldier of the band "The Hands Up," and now the solo performer, businessman and actor Sergei Zhukov posted in his official Instagram-account a picture from Kalazin Tver oblast.

Perhaps the singer is resting in the beautiful city of Tver region with his family.
The people of the region have already thanked the performer for the visit, as well as expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Child" in the post is probably in view of the new version of the old song that Zhukov has now recorded with the blogger and musician David Manukian (DAVA M).
But most fans stay for the old version, "Sergey, the old version of the song is 1,000,000 times better!
Support me for the loyal fans of Hands Up, "We don't need a new baby."
Most people write it outright that the original, which was a hit at the time, is more like it.

The US called on Qatar and its neighbours to put an end to the dispute
There is a need to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other States, as the United States Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, believes.
He said that the conflict between the Emirate and the other countries of the region had lasted too long and was prejudicial to regional interests in the areas of stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a dispute that Washington regards as a “threat of efforts to contain Iran.”
Diplomatic relations with Qatar broke up three years ago by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They imposed a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, in Doha, the neighbours said that they were simply envious of Qatar’s economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar had been a major producer of per capita GDP for a number of years.
The Emirates is the third largest natural gas exporter, the sixth exporter of natural gas, and the major exporter of petroleum and petroleum products.

How the economy will be affected by the decision of the CB to lower the core rate
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It went down another 0.25 percentage points, up to 4.25% of the annual, officially the next historical minimum.
Judging from the return of the short step of the rate reduction, as well as the tone of CB statements and the up-to-date forecasts of the Russian economy, the regulator is more optimistic about the economic prospects than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy relaxation can soon stop.
“We have continued to relax monetary policy, especially given that the risk of a 4 per cent drop in inflation in 2021 remains,” reported the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvir Nabiullin.
They are associated with a significant drop in economic activity, a drop in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
She noted, however, that, following the lifting of the restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes had recovered: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand had been rebounded, the construction and production of consumer goods had been expanded, and the annual rate of decline in transport and production had slowed.
According to the updated CB, in 2020 the economy will be cut by 4.5 to 5.5 per cent (previously 4 to 6 per cent), and the recovery of the economy in 2021 will be between 3.5 and 4.5 per cent, and in 2022 it will be between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the prognosis for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The CB had previously expected US$ 27 and 35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7 to 4.2 per cent, as compared with the previously expected 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, bringing us closer to the end of the relaxation cycle, and sofia Donets and Andrej Melashchenko, economists for Russia and the CIS, the Renaissance Capitala, believe.
For example, the Bank of Russia has consistently lowered the key rate over a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the CB reduced it by one percentage point at a time, due to low inflation due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate a stagnant economy due to the pandemic and its associated constraints.
The prospect of monetary policy fixing remains (at the next meeting on September 18 and the end of the year), but the limit is at hand, agreed by the Chief Analyst Rosbanka Yevgeniy Koschelev.
The combination of inflationary risks also points to the proximity of a pause in the relaxation of interest policies - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to the prevention of the epidemic, and a faster (than expected) recovery of demand, he said.
As a result of the Bank of Russia’s follow-up actions, Koshelev points out that more attention will be needed to the inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as to the external volatilities that have increased in the context of geo-political conflicts.
In one way or another, lowering the core rate will result in further lowering the rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as perhaps on the mortgage, says Maxime Petronevich, a senior analyst at the Bank of Discovery.
The rate adjustment would be less pronounced than the reduction in the core rate, he clarified.
The interest rate may fall by an additional 0.3-0.6 percentage point in the second half of the year, and the mortgage rate may end in the range of 6.2-7 per cent, and does not exclude the BCS Prime economist Anton Poctovic.
The average deposit rate, in his view, would also fall - in the coming months it could fall by 4.2 to 4.5% (now barely above 4.5%).
Then they can go down to 4%, if the CB lowers the key rate in the fall, Poctovitch thinks.

Survey: The Governing Union of Landlords and Greens of Lithuania again led the party ratings
The Union of Farmers and Green Lithuania, led by the Sejm ruling coalition, led the party ratings.
This was shown by a poll conducted by Vilmorus Sociological Research Company on the order of the Lietuvos rytas newspaper.
After winning the parliamentary elections in 2016, the "crusaders" lost their first place and long led Russia's main critic in Lithuania, the opposition "Union of the Nation - Christian Democrats (Conservatives).
Recently, however, the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nauseda, in his assessment of the electoral capabilities of the parties, stated that the Union of Farmers and Greens, after this year's parliamentary elections, is likely to be able to form the coalition again.
This statement provoked the resentment of the Conservatives.
A recent poll showed that if the parliamentary elections had taken place today, 17.6 per cent of the voters and 17.2 per cent of the conservatives would have voted for the peasants.
According to Director Vilmorus Vladas Haydes, the break-up was within the limits of error, and yet the rulers had ceased to lag behind the conservators.
According to Haydes, the sociological success of the “crusaders” has been facilitated by the news that Prime Minister Saulius Svernimis will be the head of their electoral list.
This politician was the first on the list of "crusaders" and in the 2016 elections.
In the third place, the Social Democratic Party is now ready to vote for 7.1 per cent of the respondents.
She suddenly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labour Party, led by a businessman of Russian origin, Victor Uspaski (6.2 per cent).
The rest of the political organizations, according to the poll, will not be able to break the 5 per cent electoral barrier.

The mayors have reported on their performance today.
In the first place, the construction of the Sports House in Ust Ord was rebuilt.
The mission was given by the President of the Russian Federation 14 years ago.
But it's only now that the situation has moved from the dead.
A total of 866 million roubles will be spent on construction.
Duration of the delivery of the building in 2022.
As of this year, the school in the village of Bayandai should be in operation.
The renovation of the premises has been completed so far.
Out of the rest of the work, it's land improvement.
In general, the programme for the construction of pre-school and secondary education is of particular importance to the region.
Especially for your district.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we have a duty to create all the conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, noted Vrio the Governor of Irkutsk oblast Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively engage in the development of human settlements genetic plans.
This is one of the main preconditions for the integrated development of the district.
All human settlements must have defined boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the Territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, as stressed by the head of the region.
The interview also raised the problem of a 30 per cent reduction in the intake of milk from cooperatives.

The authorities of Pod-Moscow reported on the fate of the closed dumps
Solid household waste sites continue to be closed down in Podskow.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being upgraded to modern waste-processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every site, and many of them have grown to a dense housing environment.
When the range closes, it gets up on the reclamation, the body of the range is overburdened by the ground, and the gas-freeing and infiltration systems are set up.
This means that the chemical processes inside the dump can be halted so that it does not ignite, stench, or poison the ground or the ground water.
And then the former dump stays up in a useless pile of housing that's been around it.
Why don't we do something useful out of it?
For example, in Rouse, where the Annino field was just completed the other day, the authorities are considering the option of making a mountain of ski slopes.
The site, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so that it went beyond the land allocated to it.
Therefore, in the reconstruction, it was necessary to buy neighbouring sites that had long been filled with rubbish.
"Sometimes, the ground's gonna sit down, and the fortress's gonna get, and we're gonna think what we can do to make it work.
A ski resort is in the eye," told the head of the Russian district, Nikolai Parthenov.
Two sites will be renewable energy sites
The Torbeevo polygons in Lubertsa and Timochovo in the Bogorod district will be sites for the extraction of renewable energy from landfill and biological gas.
At the end of the year, a gas-pumping power plant will be launched in the territory of Torbeeva, which can produce up to 8 million kilowatt hours of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal power that will provide for its own needs, namely, the heating of administrative and industrial facilities.
Timochovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue as a waste-processing complex.
And at the Kuchino Balachino field, which was closed after the people's complaints on the front line with the president of the country, a museum may be created.
"The idea was to create a museum for the rehabilitation of the Pod-Moscow fields," the Deputy Minister of the Environment and Environmental Management of Dmitri Kurakin, reported to the Government.

According to Degtyrev, the country of Khabarov cannot be left without a leader, so it was appointed by decree of President Vladimir Putin to head the region so that “a remarkable building (the government of the province) would function, everything would work, the budget would be spent on social needs”.
Vrio the governor explained that he had not gone to the protesters before, because he was unable to talk to thousands of protesters.
So he broadcasts on social media and reads all the comments on them.

The meetings in support of the former Governor have been held in the region since 11 July.

Beautiful high minarets only decorated Aya-Sophia
Again, about Aya-Sophia, the text of Vladimir Zelinsky, which, like, must be protested.
First of all, there's a free entry - cheers!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but the House of God is better free than paid.
Second, the Muslims conquered this land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volgo Oak Revolt, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
We're gonna give it all back to everyone?
You don't think there's any Gentiles who'll want to return their temple, where the Tenth Church is?
Third, the Muslims have improved the building, invested in it.
I mean, it's just like the factories and properties that the Leninians took from the bourgeois to their property, which belong to the Leninians - Putin and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so they're all right progressors.
The beautiful high minarets have very adorned Aya-Sophia, very.
It was a stupid ink, it was a stupid ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “Islamic” or “orthodox” civilizations.
Some are believers, some are hypocrite, some are hypocrite, and some are hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization is not thinking.
It's the thinking of the British MIDA Toynbee, a believer, who's ashamed to think like that.
And to the believer is the place of prayer.
Always.
The believer does not pray except where he is asked to go. He is taken to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're bars, not tumbling rocks.

The decision to expand the RPLs would not be supported either by UEFA or FIFA
Alexander Dukov, President of the Russian Football Union (RSF), believes that it is not right to expand the Russian Prime League (RPL) to 18 teams at the moment.

A Russian show actor responded to the charges of "LGBT propaganda and feminism"
An actor from the Russian show "Chichi", who was accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism", responded to a claim to the film.
The authors “understood the acuteness of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone,” said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the edition of The Upstairs.
"I think it's a story about power and common aspects of human life.
This has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor who played the father of the boy, who dressed as a woman's dress.
He stressed that he was “greeting for work” and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he was frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the show: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep jam shot the set and said that it was not true."
"Then a couple of times we met disgruntled locals who didn't know what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who first came forward with claims began to help us,' he summed up.
