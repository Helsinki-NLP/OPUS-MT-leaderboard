Good afternoon, I'm so sorry, but I haven't had a small Internet and I couldn't send it any quicker.
Can you please tell me the exact address to go to the cleaning tomorrow, what's the code to the keys and about what time tomorrow, the guests go out, and the new guests move in?
I'm sorry, I have to give up your offer, because I really have already found a job in this time.
I'm sorry, but I can't say no.
I sometimes feel that, through a translator, my thoughts in the Czech language are different from those I wrote in the Ukrainian language.
We promised you a surprise when you went to school.
Good day, I'll take the course.
However, please indicate if there is a time earlier.
Because I don't live in Prague, there might be a problem with transport.
If there are no options, I'll still agree.
Thank you well in advance.

Back in the day, the townsmen had traditionally gathered to protest at the Square of Liberty, near the ODA building and the oblast.
This area is now under control, as is the building, by the armed Russian forces, which use weapons against protesters and steal people.

According to Ucrynform, in Donechen there are regular peaceful protests against a Russian agressor.

Hey, I'm sick, so it's best to take our meeting to the next weekend, I'm sorry.
I know how to cook, but I like to bake.
In Ukraine, borsche, cooks, and others are common.
I don't have any favorite foods, I like to go through a variety of foods in different countries.
What do you like about food, you like to cook?
I want to be busy.
There's a train, and there's no place
Sorry, we're a little late.

If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Mariopole, the heart of war, stop fighting, we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr of Zelenski believes that the battle for the east of Ukraine, and in particular for Mariopole, will determine the course of the war – and if the U.S.S.S.S. is defeated there, the Russians can give up the talks and reoccupy the deocracy.
The direct language is, "Mariopole is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It fights, we fight, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have a weaker position.
They (the protectors of the city, ed.) are people who have drawn upon themselves a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariopole, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the EPA, and if they are stronger, the table of victory will be closer to us, and we will have the advantage of a dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these ways, we may not be able to wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we've been depriving us of.
They can go for that too.
Then we'll have a weaker and perhaps not even an interest in the Russian side.
Sadly, we note.
We believe in our result, in our victory... "
Details: Greenski also said that it is difficult to go to talks after the torture of the Ukrainians, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
The direct language is, "People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of independence in Ukraine, but... every family lost something - and I don't think any peace will please them on any condition.
But if we don't talk emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of casualties.
And even where there's a million casualties, it all comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight, but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for the dust when there's nothing, there's no people."
Good day, do you have any more space for the Czech class for adults from 7:00 a.m. on Tuesday?

As a result of the change in academics in Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new quality status.
It's the analysis of the metaphoric space of Ukrainian literature, the status study.
the Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows for the analysis of the postmodern context, such as the one where the metaphor plays the role of an acciological test

The Department of Defence of Ukraine's main intelligence agency published a list of Russian military officials who had been involved in the commission of military crimes in the city of Bucha of Kyiv.
According to Ucrynform, this is reported by the Department of Defence of Ukraine in Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian must know their names!
The MoU of Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 individual motor-aircraft crews who are directly involved in the commission of military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Butch,” is in the report.
In the MOU GUR, it is stated that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and held accountable.
You can view the list by reference.
According to Ucrynform, Irpin, Butch, Hotel, and the entire region of Kyiv were freed from Russian invaders.
In the freed cities and villages, there are mass killings by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, the city head of Bouchi, Anatoly Fedorook, reported that 280 people had been buried in mass graves.
On April 3, the General Prosecutor, Irina Venediktov, said that 410 bodies of dead civilians had been removed from the Russian invaders of the region of Kyiv.
On February 24, Russia’s president, the ruler of the road, announced the beginning of a full - scale invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian invaders are firing and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shellings of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, jet systems of fire, ballistic missiles, air bombs.
Good day, I'm sorry, but I won't be able to work for you, because I'm going to fly to Canada in the nearest time.
Right behind the dash are the formal names, and at risk are the slang expressions, in the parentheses, the shortcuts that are used on the schedule of the hours.
I don't want to disturb you, rest
I've been looking at the forecast for a while.
I don't need brandy.
It's just a nice dress at normal prices and size.
We were at the store at the train station.
The professions that offer. Can be unfamiliar?
It's important, if there's a tradition, I need to know what I'm going to do.
I thought after a week, but the situation is getting hot, so be quiet.
Tomorrow might be a bad connection on the road.
I thank everyone for their experience, even if he's in pain.
I think I've learned from each situation for myself to keep it from happening again.
The directives are given in the form of numbered written additions, which are part of the Rules.
I'm sure it won't be a problem.
In Ukraine, a lot of people are also celebrating this week.
It depends on religion.

Let them cover you with their cover of love and warmth this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Do you mind if I come right after the war?
a place, a day, and a time will be specified according to the interests and possibilities
We promised you a surprise when you went to school.
It's great, I've got money for two months of rent, in Olomouc the area doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photographs of people who had been shot and shot have puzzled the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century!
And I'm not surprised at all, and it's exactly what I was waiting for.
I took out the children and the elderly parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the girl coworkers with the kids, and then he went back to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I've been helping the U.S.S.S.A. in a consistent way, and I have no doubt that, in the case of the occupation, my family will not be spared.
Because I was, and I am absolutely sure, that the essence of the rotting communist-CDB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it just can't exist, it's built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in Gitomir's prison.
A few years ago, in the U.S.S.S.A., a copy of the shoot-out case of the great-grandfather was taken: the whole case was over a hundred pages, and the death sentence was very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was unwritten, denied the charge.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was a free man, a poor "one-door" high, never went to the fortresses.
The fact that they had a couple of cows on the courtyards was enough to condemn the farmer and the breadwinner of young children to death.
The family did not even know the place of burial.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people had been taken out of the village and killed all but two who had agreed to give false testimony.
There's the name of the scissor, the scissor.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics, and I won't be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informer.
The apple from the apple is not far from falling, as we know...
The shooter who had ordered the death of the villagers was ethnic Russians.
Analysing the case of the great-grandfather, he was interested in a variety of information resources.
In Russia, there are wonderful (no sarcasm) information resources like "The Infinite Baracke," which are reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NCV-Dists have found ways to punish and kill almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 to 80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalin’s repression and publicly wrote the names of the killers — the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like a computer found files with child pornography, put in jail for it, and it's gone fast.
The KGB is still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly amazed at their actions now?!!
There is a concentration of the worst traits of human nature.
On top of a thousand-year Ordinary tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism began in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then what came out of it was a wild genetic experiment, cutting out the intellect during a few waves of red terror.
Look at the semi-French movie "Chequist" of 1992, that's what happened.
Zo you've seen my picture in the bathing suit
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from the cough?
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.

Lugos, Igor asks if you can drive tomorrow? (It's out and can go, because the car hasn't been seen at the station yet.)
We're very sorry to bother you so much.
You're very helpful, thank you!
▪ In the Barodyan, under Kyiv, the bodies of seven civilians have been found in two multisurface homes in the process of clearing the rubble.
▪ Mariopole’s protectors claimed that an unknown poisonous substance had been spilled over the city from a Russian unmanned man.
Three people suffered.
▪ Some 1,700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held in Russian prisons.
Among them are 500 women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euro to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating the war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has implemented sanctions for 33 enterprises in the Russian defence sector.
* In the past days, one enemy tank, three armoured personnel carriers, three artillery systems, 24 units of car technology, one helicopter, and three unmanned men were destroyed in the battles in the east of Ukraine.

When girls return from school, what do they do?
We've come to the place where we've been set up from the center in the parochial, the conditions are good.
But there's a big one, but there's a man here who drinks alcohol and smokes in a room, loud music is the least that's "consoled," the smell of cigarettes by drunken men, and me and the kids... it's scary to go to bed, to be honest.
Please help with the accommodation, please.
But where it's safe and not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is like this, and it's like they're smoking right here.
I beg you very much, one of them is barely standing on his feet, something is yelling, something he doesn't like.

Everyone's following the Facebook page.
They asked me to say hello to you and say that it's very interesting for them to read the news.
There was also talk of people of Roma nationality who had privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child comes and the parents don't even understand Czech, then after work I can help them with the phone.

And I have a problem with that if I don't love a man doesn't work out.
Yeah, we took the aunt home right away.
She was very grateful, and she was crying.
I told her about you and how you helped the Ukrainians.
She had tears in her eyes.
I said if it was possible, there might still be some old blanket and a pillow.
But it doesn't have to, but if it does, I'm very grateful to you too.
I was sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had a lot of questions about God, why my life has been in a situation that has just made me dislike everything.
And the small grocery store works? I need to buy bread and other food.
I just decided to go and you made the meetings.
That's right, but we don't even know where it is. We've been looking for an hour today and we've been back on foot.
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you texted me.
Does your father know how to speak Russian or any other family?

True they go to school so three, because Galia and Holy Slave learn remotely to graduate from the school of the country and get a graduation certificate in the fall they have to go to colleges
Tell me how to get to the center of the city.
I'll share my thoughts with you.
To me, marriage is the secret of two people who do not discuss with one another with their loved ones or friends.
A man and a woman decide the matter themselves in their family, especially without the involvement of the family.
Can we be together?
It'll take a while before we're around.
Why not try this way for now
I rented a car for nine people, we'll come with Mariana and your family.
What time do you have?
Yeah, I'm glad to hear jazz.
Thank you. I'm working on it. We've been told about it in the Czech classes on Wednesday.
For the past four years, I haven't let anyone near me, I've read a lot of books in philosophy, and I've been looking at myself.
When it hurts, it's hard to trust you.
But you have to try again, everyone's going through something that changes it forever, it's life.
Martin, we're going to bed.
Thank you for such a good and fun day.
We loved it all.
We feel like we're in our family.
The children spent the whole evening telling your father, all your grandparents how good you had them.
From the girls of greetings, we're the best wishes for the festivals.
And now we've been watching
I hope the son will live out of this meat cutter.
Let's go today, maybe something will be needed.
How do you contact them to open the door?
Is there any improvement in overcoming the coronavirus?
Thank you very much for helping people, if you can help us, find a low-cost home.
We're in Slape right now, we're being held by friends for a while.
My family is a man, a 6-year-old daughter, a 11-year-old son.
The man had already found a driver's job.
I'm a masseuse, a rehabist, looking for a job.
For the children to attend school, and for me to work, we need a place to live close to civilization.
I just had to give it to the country today!
I didn't know even the big shops would be closed.
I make the doves like this: in a pot of tomato paste, I make a tomato paste of 0.5 liters of water of 3-4 canteens of tomato paste, that's to make it boil .
I'm putting the doves in the pot and pouring that sauce.
I've been carving in the oven for about 1.5 hours.
How much money do I have on this room?
I have to bring it all.
From Monday four.
4. In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine can request humanitarian assistance at the new place of work of the Directorate of Work in the Przy market.
The branch office in Hall No. 29 is dedicated to providing and processing requests for help, so there is a translator in the field.
Lydia's been sent to school, but we're going to go to school on Tuesday. I told you today.
I'm sitting there, holding headphones on my ears, listening to music, and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I think we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there's gonna be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what's gonna happen to the house.
I need to get a food license test, can I do that in you?
Please tell me to cook the apartment for 5 guests tomorrow.
Is this the fifth place I understand in the TV room?
Plan and fix the sofa?
Can we stay at your place until Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one that's been taken advantage of, but it's working, but it's not needed.
Write the address in Czech, let's see the map where it's from us
I don't know how much space there is so I can't plan with the furniture want this week to finally look at that apartment and then figure out which furniture I need
I'm sorry it took so long to answer, work day, it's hard to adapt
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, have this opportunity to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how you feel.
For the baby, there's already a bed and a bathtub that I found for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me as soon as you can, but don't give me the last one.
I want to make a haircut that's called a hat
Oleg's got a disease, a diet and a cough.
I'll just be a little bit later - about 8:00, okay?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
'Cause I'm worried it's gonna be okay!?
Because we haven't even talked about it with these excerpts!
I know how important this is to you!
I'm not talking about myself.
How are you feeling today?
Hi, I'm sorry, I just woke up, didn't sleep well.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I was saddened that Collea and I had a bad start on the test last night.
I'm going to ask whether Gregory Denisenka or Jonasek) to help me with some math.
Maybe there's something I can do for them too.
If that's possible, I'd like to pick up mathematical terms in the weekend.
Geometry is hard at all, but we have to work with the wheel to make no mistakes.
Thank you for the Test Jobs
We hope so too.
Oh, well, she's very happy about any gift.
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Last night, at the 402 bus stop, I met the Ukrainian Victoria.
This girl is a kid, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay out of it.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine to have a heart-to-heart relationship.
The branch office in Room No. 29 is dedicated to the provision and processing of requests for help
found out so I ordered a backup card
No, I'm just a man.
So she won't be afraid that no one's gone
I didn't go, it was the fire, it's the most important thing you've taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're moving out of town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babin Yar Memorial Center in Kyiv, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of the Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of State, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in a territorial whole, peaceful and secure Europe.
This is the basis that we need to protect, as well as part of our responsibility to our history.
If "the evil demons of the past show up today in new clothes," he said, "there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!
The fight must last."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the inhabitants of the cities that it has blocked, and lets them die of disease.
The Russian forces are carrying out mass shots of the Ukrainians, even visibly similar to the shots in Babin Yar.
For over a month, the Germans see it in real-time news.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons that have not been imaginable for a long time.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than just opposing the swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risk and sacrifice to conquer evil and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, bid for a tour, and write when to be gathered
All were sick only Lydia didn't get sick they had omicron a new kind of horse
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
That's the ticket I'm using instead of the car.
Discuss the lateness of the documents.
The ticket cost me 2000 guineas at the head
Sergei Sidorenko: Our membership of NATO is no longer a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67 percent of the Ukrainians were opposed to joining NATO, and only 18 percent of the respondents spoke in favor.
After the Revolution of Greed, the flight of Victor Yanukovic, the anexiety of the Krim, and the start of the Donbasi war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the outbreak of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – over 75 per cent.
Despite the support of Ukraine's entry into NATO and the help it provides in the context of war, there is now much criticism of the Alliance and the country members – for the untimely provision of weapons, for refusing to close the sky, for wanting to "frequently" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its desire to join the Alliance through the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and that Ukraine will receive credible security guarantees, including military guarantees.
In the new episode of "The Curse of the Question" with the editor of "European Truth" talk about how the Alliance has helped the Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance has been criticized in vain, why our prospect of joining NATO is as close as ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in the battles with Russia can become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here
I have a volt partner that my application is on the table.
I gave it to you through this mobile plugin.
We don't have a visa, we need to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was in Poland, where the visa was not given, but given a pestel.
We'll send you a letter!
Denis was in a good mood today.
I made a deal with a boy from the Ukraine I met yesterday, meet him at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
'Cause that's how I don't love, I'm not enough for a long time.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and combat vehicles to Ukraine.
I'm going to leave the children alone, waiting for 3-4 years, and I'm going home because I can't leave them.
And we'll go with us for 6-7 in the morning.
Yes, there was a heart condition.
I had sincere feelings for this man, but he didn't do very well and I left him.
After a while, he returned and asked me to forgive him.
I said no to him.
After a while, he called to see that he had had a heart operation.
Asked him to just have a nap, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported it for almost half a year.
During that time, we had a lot of conversation.
I had a problem at work in parallel.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I was thinking, maybe you really need to look at it differently.
And he offered me to get married, and two days later he died.
Therefore, God has made his own decision.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only speaks Czech
I wanted to tell you that I was able to find a place to live, and I'm very happy that I have a place to live and a place to be with the baby.
Did I have to remember before?
( ) Because I was helping to watch the children in the family.
Don't be sorry, just write down the phrases you didn't get.
I know that the translator doesn't always translate the text right.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor, is it supposed to give the paper?
They must have forgotten, I put it in the closet.
Maybe it's time for you to go to bed to work tomorrow
Can anyone help, the things you need for a woman the size of an XS or a S the size of a 165? And for her daughters the 8th, 10th, 12th.
that time in the ice, I bought two packs, and my mom bought two.
It's very nice of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
All right, let's talk about something else, and I'm not sleeping, I'm still in bed, and I'm dreaming about bombarding...
God is never late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I understand very well the cost of incompetent work, and I know that the kind of work I had at home in Kyiv I can't have here and the money I made at home I won't get here either.
But just sit down and do nothing, I can't do it, because then all the bad thoughts in your head are putting themselves in a physical way.
At the airport, documents are issued from 7 a.m. to 7 a.m., and at another time you can just wait.
The Lord returned at 4:00 a.m.
So we took them with us.
We slept with Vic in the kitchen, and they put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to the airport with them.
When you have it, write and find out what's next...
'Cause I don't have a place anymore.
Mr., please, these are the invitations of the Ukrainian children who will be joining the gymnasium.
Yeah, but I do it hard.
Okay, text me when it's handy.
I don't know about work yet.
It's better that we change the changes sometimes?
I'm sorry, I don't really have any missed calls from midday.
I suggest work, cleaning the bathroom and toilet, washing three windows, dusting.
Work is about 3-4 hours, 800green is a disposable sum, from 1904 Tuesday, from 2:00 p.m.
I hope I'll just tell you that we're good.
Can I call you?
Or can you write your wife's contact?
Grisko started coughing, I want to ask you what I can buy at the pharmacy.
I'd like to ask you some advice.
We have Anna as the root of the name Anja
She was handed by her uncle from home
Made the English version, added new partners
Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget me, please.
Monday and Wednesday classes are different?
Thank you very much. You're doing a lot for our family.
You need help to stay in the pool
But that's what I think.
My uncle gave her the rollers and the skating board, she rolled at home, so it's got
I also got up at 9:00, and I'm just making breakfast right now.
I'm sorry you're in touch with me on your weekend, but I hope I'm not very annoyed.
We want to report the change in the home and also submit the documents to continue the map
We're now delivering medical oxygen to all hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you there's gonna be a snack tomorrow.
One mom said she'd make doughnuts for the kids.
He's coming to you at the guest's
Please tell me, do you have an estimate of the time frame for cleaning the flats a month ahead, even if for a reasonable understanding of what days?
I won't remember any of this schedule )
The Russian army is threatening to launch rockets on Kyiv, saying, "No, we haven't done this before."
Conashenkova's direct language: "We're trying to sabotage and try to hit the Ukrainian forces on objects in the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike the decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army had previously resisted.”
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine.
On February 25, the rest of the Russian rockets that crashed the U.S. POP system fell on a multi-family building in the city’s late months.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a large area at the Valery Lobanovskiy Prospect.
On March 1, the Russians put on a TV on the Roads near Babin’s Jaru, killing five passersbys.
On March 2, the U.S. POP systems hit a Russian missile in the direction of the Ministry of Defence building over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the hit-and-run missile of the occupiers shattered a building and a trollbus in Kurenovc in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential massage on the Vineyard, killing one person, and wounding another 19 people, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets destroyed the modern RTR Retroville on the Vineyard, killing at least four people.
The mayor of Kyiv, Vitaly Clique, announced on April 13, that the inhabitants of the capital, who had been evacuating the city, had yet to return.
The army explained to the local authorities that Russians could still launch rockets at Kyiv, and there were many mines and undisturbed weapons in the area of the capital.
The Department of Defence of Ukraine’s main intelligence agency warned on April 12, that the Russians were planning a series of terrorist attacks in the territory of the Russian Federation to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, a naphtobasa exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that a “Ukrainian projectile” had fallen near the city.
Evidently, the elites in Washington, D.C., and Berlin, thrown in a cold sweat from the very idea that the Nazis would kill the Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelenski is not talking to them as much as to their choices and societies in general.
By his speech in Parliament and before the thousands of crowds on the major European cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors have been able to reach.
Green doesn't convince European politicians to do anything for Ukraine; it convinces the European peoples that the politicians choose.
And these talks, this elegant alloy of power, the touchiness, and the time of despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
As long as the same Biden is categorically opposed to the closing of the sky, 70 percent of its fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Though Paris or Brussels is against the speeding up of Ukraine's introduction, this process is already under way.
I understand, so I don't want to be considered a fraud.
The baskets you're going to collect are best to give to people who need it more.
I can come to you, and we'll figure it out.
But the air's clear, this is plus .
It says I've got a double-on-the-net rate, and I asked you to do the Internet.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff
Do we have any other space today, or, as always, just the top down?
So I'm on my way in that you're a train
But I won't stop loving you, you're everything to me.
A financial consultant is in charge of the loan.
So it takes a few days.
Katya asked for the Internet, can I give her a password?
I thought you and Milana didn't shoot each other.
Super then my man's gonna drive me because he's got a car for today from the firm he works in the building.
We are very happy and grateful that our Nick and grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you very much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we can invite you to Ukraine!
one has to be cut into 4 parts.
one of these can be used for 2-3 days, but strip every hour
I'm interested in architecture and color
I'm so glad you're okay.
In fact, at 4:20 p.m., the concert starts at 6:00, and then I'm free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet
So I'll make tea and get some candy.
I went to the school page and I'm gonna try and order ana lunch for tomorrow.
But to go out on weekends in a lot of love
So can we go over there tomorrow, find out the terms?
My name is Sasha, and I came from Luganski to Prague.
I'm a certified masseuse and a 27-year-old nurse in neurology.
I'm offering medicinal massage, a rehab gym for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech intensively.
Contact: ---- I'd like to have a letter that the Czechs can write to you via a translator, SMS is not here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, they don't agree.
You really don't want this?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they have for it.
If you don't need a primelist, I won't put it on.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
Dores you didn't want to write to me today... something
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask.
Actually, I'm just asking for attention today.
I have so much to say today, so I ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, you go to work, you plan to buy, you get off.
You have dreams.
You're planning to buy that dress you saw last night at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't take it.
He's chipping for the old reality.
You call to work, see if you can go out to work today or not.
Children decide to stay at home.
As long as it's clear.
There's hope... it's not all for long.
Now... they're gonna make a deal... something's gonna happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
I don't have anyone or anywhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket.
Many of our leaders did not pay for our work.
Where do I go? Who needs me?
You can't take a lot of stuff.
You didn't take anything from the house... you drive 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag the children all over Prague.
We don't know how long, we don't know how long.
And from every iron, we don't have that.
We have a choice: stay there and alert the children to danger, or try to escape here.
She was very happy with those hearts and the stuff that the kids gave her when she got to school.
I needed to get a call when you arrived.
I'll text you at dinner.
Yes, I believe in God alone, and I believe in my life
I don't have the power to do it anymore.
I thought you'd been in love with a Ukrainian girl and had no time to talk to him.
On the menu, I sorted it out, even ordered
2. Would you be interested in sharing with your Czech neighbors, friends, and the community?
If so, which type, type.
Please send a page with a visa or a window seal (red with a date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian help.
Mrs. Libushe, did you pay for the clear?
Because I can't figure it out.
You're doing us so much good...
We owe you a great deal... thank you!
Yeah, I know that's very good.
I'll send you a picture of the lady's visit I'm teaching English.
Well, you'll write it down tomorrow, meet or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We've got enough. It'd be so good to know a man from Ukraine.
If you want to, you can be with me after work.
Don't you want to meet me after 4:00?
What are your general impressions from the first week
Carina brought us the drugs last night, and we drink them.
I can work with lying sick and invasive children
But you have to say that I speak only Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.
Can I swab you for a little bit of business?
'Cause it's just anti-bacterial gel.
I don't know, or I'm not really in the city... about half a dozen.
What services/activities do you think are needed/not available for older people?
I don't know because there was no text from the bank and I didn't take the bank cards, and the kids took out the bank attachment with it. They really upset me.
Then text me if you want to go.
Today we have the joy - our city of Butch was freed from the occupiers, and our armies survived.
It's purged from the enemy, looking for the Russians in the basements and apartments.
The whole city has been replaced, and the work of switching will begin.
And Ivan would see if something needed to be repaired or something else done.
Diana, as you like, maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Our mistress wants to stay home, says he's tired of us, and he wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
Let's do the masanne and do the homework.
These are small businesses that have opened up volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
They're tractors, who are actually going to the field under fire, because it's time to sow.
These are the bus drivers who agree to go to humconvoys today to temporarily occupied areas in order to get help and get the people out of there.
These are heroic leaders who, fearlessly, go to the war zone, calm and help the refugees in the wagons, and at the peaceful stations help the volunteers to load the humanitarians in the wagons.
These are the gas stationers who stood on the Gitomir Road in the early days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous.
They're communicators who take out trash under fire, fix pipes, and power lines to provide the people with the needed supplies.
They're doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and they're still volunteering to pick up the first-aid kit on the front.
We're in the Ukraine, running out of juice when the small ones have leaves)
Say, please, little kids-- what age do you mean?
My daughter's 8 years old, is that an acceptable age?
I'm looking for a home for my daughter and me for three to four days every day to come to the Czech Republic and hand over the passports for a visa to Canada.
There's a lot of people in Warsaw at the Visa Center and they don't work on-line.
I wanted to come one day, but it's far, it takes a lot of time on the train, it's gonna be hard for the kid.
So I decided to look for a home in or near Prague.
No, we're fine.
Last Hardware to drop
But I can't change the password when I follow a link, because I have this error:
It's in the microwave, something's on fire.
In Ukraine, the operators of the largest banks are always in contact with clients 24 hours a day, and all questions are resolved quickly :)
Well, it's okay. I'll get to the new reality.
I don't like it, and I want you to know that.
You can edit the report, the most important thing is the truth.
Yeah, TV's full of it.
We've already arranged for the fridges. Some Czech guys have responded at 1:00 p.m. to help us move.
I want to go to you, give you a strong hug, and kiss you.
At 7:30, I'm reading the history of the world theater to actors, directors, and theatricians.
Evening, I appreciate the objects. After supper
Grisko's still asleep, at night was very crying, licking the tooth .
I'm on the phone right now with everyone I know from Lviv, and a lot of people are dead.
The Czech Republic began to issue visas after March 22, according to me.
By that time - put the stamps like this and then likened the stamps to a visa
Ukraine's Foreign Voting District (Ukrainian PLO) is an electoral district that unites the electoral districts outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting rooms at the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and at military bases abroad, [vinoc 1] where the Ukrainian peace-keeping forces (Cosovo and DDR Congo) are present.[1] The role of the district election committee for the Concordian Electoral Region is performed by the Central Electoral Commission.
In the foreign electoral district, there is only a state-wide vote: the election of the President and the people's deputies, and the national referenda.
Local elections are not held.
They're at the station by the mother's and child's room.
Says he doesn't know where to go any more.
Are you mad at me?
I'm gonna take a picture of it in my bathing suit.
I don't need any more money. I borrowed a long term.
I wanted to say that I had already set up a Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device to do that, so I went to O2 and they made me an electronic SIM card, which I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
I'm very uncomfortable, Sunday works and I can't.
You said you had a broken washing machine, take it for yourself, you need it too.
We don't have enough carpets, swollen carpets, dishes. Children don't have pyjamas and nothing to move into.
Good morning, I'll be leaving at 10... write the address again, there's a text missing.
I don't want to torture you or myself, I'm gonna kill myself.
So it'd be good, but I know that there was no free space, and in principle, they have all the lessons right now, and they're doing pretty well.
Do you have a meat cutter to make the stuff? We do, but it doesn't work.
Let it be after the day
Last night, did your mom say something hurt you?
She can't tell them what she wants, and not everything understands what they're saying. (But yesterday she came with a great mood after that fair.)
I went to school today too.
I saw Christina's mom today, but she didn't even say hello (
Very tasty apples, what kind of class is that?
The head of the Office of President Andreas Jermack informed us that Russia is starting a "feasibility operation" on the weapons that the allies are handing over to us.
The direct language of Jermak is, "They know they're losing war, they see their backwardness, and they want to beat up the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last faucets is the total destruction of the U.S.S.S.S.S. 300.
This information has already been disproved by the Prime Minister, Edouard Heger.
We know the scripts of the Russians, the name of one of them.
They can launch fairy-tales that the Ukrainian soldiers seem to have weapons from the allies, and it's massively moving on to arming the Russian army.
I'd like to warn you of those fags right away.
For the weapons in the hands of the U.S.S.S. Warriors are exclusively sending the enemy to that world.
Would you excuse me if I forgot to ask you how much it cost to have a garden in the month and if it's gonna work in the summer?
Everyone is given the power.
There are a lot more dubious stories, believe me.
So I needed to survive to change.
In the Torah it is written, and God created in man a bad start to make it change in the way of life, to become better
This is your home, you can invite anyone you want)
How do we find this lady in social security tomorrow before we go to the hospital want to visit the city hall?
He listened to his mom and didn't come with us.
I know it's been hard for you.
And I'll make you happy.
After what you texted me today, I'm happy.
I hope you meant it seriously.
I'm looking at the ad is a lot already taken. Now it's hard for us to do this.
I'm sorry, I didn't get the whole point.
You didn't get a call today because of the change in the rate of the mobile operator?
I'm sorry, but I can't count on anyone in this life.
Today I was offered a job for every day.

The international community continues to express shock and resentment following the evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as a “provocation.”
“The report of dead, raped, and severely wounded by the Russian forces of Ukrainian civilians is worth the conviction,” the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jasinda Ardern, said to the journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that its government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
The Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kissida, called the incidents a “violation of international law”.
It was reported that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the outskirts of Kyiv, in Bouchi, by Russian troops who had left the area after the occupation for a few weeks.
Photographs that seem to represent the bodies of the civilians who have been killed with their hands tied have shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal persecution of the guilty.
French president Emmanuel Macron announced to the radio interview on April 4, that there are signs that Russian forces have committed “war crimes” in Butch.
“What happened in Butch requires a new round of sanctions and very clear actions,” Macron said, adding that the additional sanctions should be directed at the Russian export of coal and oil.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez, said that Russian forces could go so far that they had committed a “genocide” in Butch.
“We will make sure that those who have committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” said Sánchez in Madrid.
In her speech on public television late on April 3, Russia's MSS-representative Maria Zecharova rejected the charge as a “provocation.”
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had “committed” images to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the material was produced does not raise any doubt as to who ordered the story,” said Zechariah.
In the past, the Russian Ministry of Defence also claimed, without evidence, that the Bouchi image was “a further order of the Kiwi regime” and that all the Russian forces had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called the “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Butch.
On April 4, Russia's follow-up committee issued a statement in which it announced the “investigation” of the charge of “knownly false information” on Russia's operations in Butch.
The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr of Zelenski, appeared on April 3, accusing the Russian forces of “genocide” in the city, and told the Kremlin’s leaders that they should come to Butchi to see what their soldiers had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being implemented,” said Zelenski in videotape, moving from the Ukrainian to the Russian language.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting at the police," he said.
He said that the Russian President Volodymyr Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the military in Ukraine.
“When we find people with hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't get it,” he said about scenes of victims scattered in the streets of Butchi, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a reporter of the Ukrainian Service Radio Liberty saw a small city on the streets of a body as if it were a civilian.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
The AP reporters have seen at least 21 bodies in different places in Butchi.
The bodies of one group of nine, all in a civilian group, were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to the locals, was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims seem to have been killed from a close distance.
Generally, the Ukrainian authorities claimed that the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in the area of Kyiv, which had been controlled by the Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, it's all there, we bought it from the list.
"They're told there's no Kyiv." As the occupiers had taken the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by horrendous things, such as pillaging, rape, murder, and torture.
There is another point in this list that is now much less well-informed – the removal of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
About the middle of March, Russian occupiers “evacuate” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied localities to their territory and to the area of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military politico.
"Ukrainian Truth"'s been looking for the expelled Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is happening, and if there are any ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text have been forced to evacuate voluntarily outside of Ukraine under psychological pressure and from failure.
Happily, they live and maintain contact with their families.
However, in view of the claims made by the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict duress.
So in Melitopole, the Russians stole the staff of the second courthouse, took the children out of there without their parents, including the 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the lost U.K. Champion from Joseph Zatzepinski's voyage.
The family of Alexander, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter, Wally, moved to Guestomel a few months before the war.
Alexander was the one who got a job at Antonov Airport, which is two and a half kilometers from the village.
The family settled in a military town, even though it was a civilian.
As true plastics, Denis and Marina had gathered their alarmed boulders in advance, but in the morning of the 24th of February, they had not been able to evacuate.
They didn't have a car, and the suburban buses didn't take anyone.
At about 12:00 p.m. on February 24, they saw a helicopter with a Latin letter V, followed by the first rockets.
One of them got into the next house.
Then the family went down to the cellar and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military had taken them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 persons were hidden in their cellar.
Not all of them decided.
"On the 6th evening of February 24th, people came up in the driveway, who spoke not in Russian, nor in Ukrainian.
They say, "Is there anyone?" - I say so. - "Get out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the cellar, if there were any weapons.
All the men were questioned if they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We've come to defend you on Ramzan Kadir's instructions."
It was the Chechen OMON, not even the army, the 25-35-year-olds.
They said, "We've been aided in the war by the Ukrainians, Sasko White (commanded the nationalist UNA-UNOSO Viking, who fought on the Chechen side of the first Russian-Chechen War, the UP), and we've come to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what was missing.
We say that the water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke the store, took the product out of it under the "the Russians will take it anyway," and brought us six bouts.
There are videos on the Internet where the children thank the Cadder for the food.
So they're the ones who, after the shop was mugged, brought the cowboy and said, "We know it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatovich."
No one particularly wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid says, "You have seven days to hand over our phones," they laughed.
They also kept separate from the Russians.
They said it's a good thing they came, because they didn't want war, because the Ukrainians are backed up, and they're all good, "Putin is a bastard, the Cadder, too, but there's nothing we can do, because our families are there."
And most of the time, they didn't fight, they used to rob shops, they used to pillage.
The chicken was taken, the one was tied to one leg by a georgian tape, and the other by a white scotch, and it was called a "polar."
They didn't come to Ukraine well-prepared.
I don't know how their intel worked... when they got beat up in Butch, so they didn't even take the dead, they said, "Do you have artery?"
More than that, we had defrauds — the Chechens didn't know each other, and in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were a stranger or not.
We had them by March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk trooper.
They set up 30 to 40 units of hardware between the houses, and ours always fell into it from the Bayrackards.
But they came and told us that the VMS is gone, but there's "Azov," and they say "Azova" is like a thousand thousand in Ukraine.
Called "Kiev has already given up" and it's been going on since early March.
One day we had a Russian visitor, either an officer of the station or a representative of the FSB, who said that we would be evacuated.
And we've been listening to the radio -- it was about the Booch, the Hotel, and we thought maybe we had a green hallway.
From the start, we gave the Chechens our lists, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian Command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
And they said, "Well, you have to feel bad for your kids!"
As it worked, they rushed us to the cellar and started shooting from under the house, or the "Grades" or the minomets.
And then it came back, and the houses in the neighborhood just burned down, and some of them fell.
There was a direct engagement in our home on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to pass on to the border and the Red Cross.
Part of it didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the country -- he said, "You're shot up there, you're sold to the organs."
We were taken through the Blackmobile, and the roads were on both sides of the road, and the technology was broken down, even though the whites told us that the Russians were moving to them right away.
There's a lot of caponers, buried tech, and soldiers.
At the White Sea pass point, we went through improvised control, many people had no documents at all, because they burned down.
We were set up in the tents of the Red Cross, and we were given tea.
And here we hear the shots!
Though they from the Belorian Red Cross said, "Oh, no, it's the planes that fly, they turn on the border."
But we're from the air, we have an education, we know what it is.
We were then loaded on the bus and taken to the Chonkie sanatorium near Gomel.
His headman, Wenger Vasil Stepanovic, came, said, "Here, I was a forelock, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashen will not stop until your thieves are slaughtered.
Poor people are suffering!
And we've got Lukashenko so good!
He'll say as he says."
They offered to interview the white journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration said to us, "You're already a traitor!"
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least so called) spread misinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
A lot of people believed it, and they were afraid to get out of Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents — our daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and the war broke out on Thursday.
At the U.S. Consulate, we had no help, and at the station in Minski, we were told that no one would get on the bus without their passports.
Let me tell you, we had a lot of help from the Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsk, and we were accompanied.
In the sanatorium, no force was held.
Our second group of migrating representatives said that you could live here for a maximum of a week-time, because Belarus is not Europe, and there's no payout.
We found an internal transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled near Mozir (about 50 kilometers from the U.S. border, U.S.A.), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket first flew out, it was beautifully lit, and then it went off.
People who boarded a bus in Mozaïra told me that the Russians there were always shooting from polygons.
But I can tell you that white men don't want to fight.
The generals are getting out of the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was invited.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, is not at all believed.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
It is not understood that their polygons are used to shoot at Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we're going to register, decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, the Ukrainian flags are probably as much now as the Estonian flags."
Marina lived in the territory of a military town in Guestomalia, along with the family of her brother, his wife and two children, who were 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nieces and asked them to collect the most needed items and documents.
In the evening, they went to sleep in the cellar of the next door.
Marina herself was unable to return home, and in principle she would not be able to do so; the house was no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you go downtown on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. We're always waiting for you!

On April 1, the city head of Bouchi, Anatoly Fedorook, delivered a joyful message: On March 31, the Ukrainian military freed the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the whole district of Kyiv.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would have felt at that time was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it was known at the same time that the Russians had shot at the very least 280 civilians.
They were killed on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back, some of the dead were minors.
Killed and tortured the village head of Motijin Olgu Suhenko, her husband Igor, and Alexander’s son, who was kidnapped on March 23, the city’s village.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a fraternal grave, and Igor in a sewer.
Both sides of the tracks 20 kilometers from Kyiv found the bodies of a number of stripped women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go home, there won't be anyone

President Volodymyr of Zelenski said that certain types of armament that Western partners were providing had come too late.
He spoke about it in an interview with the Associated Press, published by the Office of the President, writing "European Truth."
"All the hardware, all they're sending, for some kinds of hardware, it's done late.
So what, when we're talking, for example, about Mariopole, when you're losing thousands of people, and now what?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the cost of these changes," said Green.
On the question of whether it was enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, there would have been no war, or it would have had a different look.
"It'd be different, we'd have the shoulders of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be a war,' he added.
We recall that the Prime Minister of Great Britain has promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armor and anti-ship weapons.

I have a super book where the Czech language is one step at a time.
The only thing I'd ask for is if it was 13:00 to 14:00, 'cause I'm working by 12:30.
To get to that place.
None after the war, none you thought.
Answer me straight.
You want to be with me?
How do you feel about me?
What can I do to convince you?
You can be there every weekend and don't get shy.
Tell me how to get to the store.
So the Czechs are very good people, and I've come on vacation to my children for 10 and 15 years and my grandmothers (received in Marianski Luzna)
These women don't get it.
We're offering a free stay.
We live in a village in a big family home with a big garden and a closed courtyard between Yevela and Gowlicov Brod.
We have two small children.
We'll have a room.
The kitchen, the bathroom, and other rooms are shared.
But first, the month of training, which will start on April 13.
On the website, there's a TV on the picture, please ask if you can come up today.
He says he's comfortable on the couch, don't worry.
If anything, we'll figure something out.
Thank you so much for your concern.
We can meet a lot.
My husband can bring him to your home tomorrow or Saturday, if that suits you.
No call, no call to the boys, I know that God is with him.
Okay, then we can go to the site by the river.
For all your time if you don't have your family right now means that you didn't come what it means when you have it will be 10 times bigger and closer than it should be
I won't be able to download, I have an old phone, I don't speak German.
I think they're looking for a baker who speaks English.
But if this document is to be printed as I did, it needs to be uploaded to the computer first.
He's got to look like this.
Give us a pyloscope for tomorrow, so we can clean up.
And then you have to ask... it depends on the weight and the size...
Thank you, we've learned something like that.
All right, take a walk, get very tired.
So if no one can come, there will be no harm?
I sent to the electron the address of the document
It's just the status we spent this time together...
There's resentment in front of themselves, and there's a lot of them... and I can't hold on to it....
You can get us the papers - the labor contract.
This robot is big, yellow, and strong.
Sending a second message to Mom
Thank you for something, but I can't go anywhere anymore. I need to cook and learn the word.
Marina, but indeed, if you need help with the city, my husband and I will.
My friend and I baked last night, try if you want.
Everyone was sick, and they had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
I just got a call from a lady in Dameidlo, and she said that they were e-mailing me information about what was going on, and I never gave an answer.
She spoke Czech, and I understood her so.
But on e-mail I don't have a letter from the lady
I need a little plaster to get a failure on the plastic.
Type or type of household activity
We're looking for a housekeeper to clean up the place here in the village.
Offer of 150 kroner/year.
Other cooperation is in line with pleasure.
The date you will agree with the lady on your own.
Of course, but I'm knocking you off the bar.
Men also have many nuances
He was a very rich man, but he liked me because I had my point of view of life. I met him, and then I left him.
He was a very rich man, and after a while he called and told him that he had had a heart operation.
He asked me to just hang out with him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man, and he thought that maybe I was his toy, and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"The car was standing in my backyard, like a crocodile, and was opening hergels.
And they kept me in the house, and then they took me to the cellar, and there were a lot of people, about 400, and there was nothing to breathe.
And what about the place that you've taken the picture
I haven't really got there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already simplified this joke.
The last two videos I'm gonna watch when the Internet works normally
Is there a dress code at work, or is it possible to walk in what it is?
All right, he'll come over there and take them.
I don't want anything
I know I can't sit in you. I have to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or even Ukrainian TV.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a pro-presidential, propaganda channel, not at all interesting to me.
What happened at the stop with the man that the police and the ambulance arrived?
Diana didn't answer me, and you didn't.
All right, I just need to print the paints out to the kids, so it'll be okay.
But perhaps you need a more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I'm worried you'll be satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who is a Ukrainian, but is a student in the Czech Republic, specializing in tourism.
You really don't want to come home with the kids for a moment, calmly and with your grandmother.
I want you to be with me, wake up next to you.
In fact, it takes a hard time in a foreign country, and every day they want to go home.
Mrs Agatha, if you want this picture, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make us live here as much as possible.
I'll remember you for the rest of my life.
And I'm going to remember and smile . . .
So thank you very much Anya's still on the route in the geolocation on the phone so we can get to the quickest
I have to pay the fare, I have to control.
How can I see how much we use?
And how do I pay?
"I'm telling her that the "renovation of the TV and the radio" was tightened up by the import details, and the friends and acquaintances are warned not to be overwhelmed by the call."
"For the whole month, we hide from the mother-in-law of the war.
So far, it's working.
However, in the Plumber (Cuska - PK) the fur froze on the punch and back paws, which may be due to stress, a change in feed, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been removed, but stress is not on me, unfortunately.
The bottle is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions, unlike the mother-in-law."
Because of Olga's poor hearing and spending most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law spent the month living in a flat with her "incognito."
And April 1st, 93-year-old Oksana Polova, for the first time in her life, took up a gun.
"33 days I lived with her as a guerrilla in the flat.
Both the war and the fact that I was in front of her were concealed, and they formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the reception -- she listened for four hours, then sang for two hours."
The radio receiver was always at bed.
My mother - in - law spends most of her time in her room.
It's not good - it lets me be imperceptible to her.
If I'd heard the sound of her "things," I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV.
And then I called everyone who was in touch with her, and that's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the start to the end
It's April 17th - I've got 2 flats:)
Good evening, I didn't think about it:)
Hey, if we need our help tomorrow, we can come.
Do you have to order lunch, can you take lunch out of the house? Do you have to print it out, or do you have to print it out, and I'll sign it?
I suggest a man's haircut, a woman's hair, a kid coming out to you, all of the crowded, please write in a personal message, a price:
I understand you, and I don't complain, but in my situation, I'm gonna be looking here for a while.
I'm telling you, the embassy is a bit here,
The British, who in the U.S.A. defended Maryupol, says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The British, who is a member of the U.S. Navy Marines, who is involved in the defence of Maryupol, told his friends and family that they would make up arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: twitter page of Aydin Aislin, a British member of the USB lava since 2018, Air Force citing members of the family and friends of Ayslin, Atlas News, citing the words of a friend of Ayslin, who spoke to him
Twitter Aislin said, "We got a message from him, "It's 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Maryupol, but we don't have a choice but to go into captivity to the Russian forces.
We don't have any food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will soon end."
Details: Aislin served as a member of the 36th squad of the U.S. Marines, who is involved in the Marine Defence Operation of Mariopole.
Air Force reporters contacted En Wood's mother, and she confirmed that her son had announced on the phone that they were planning to go into captivity.
The second warlord, Brennan Philips, also confirmed to the reporters that in the last telephone conversation Icelyn spoke about the plans of their subdivision with the capitulation.
According to him, the crew ran out of ammunition and food.
The reporters of Atlas News contacted a friend of his who said that Aislin's unit intended to surrender to the Russian subdivisions in order not to get into the hands of the so-called “cadavers” without weapons and bullets.
In the social media, there was also an audio - recording of a telephone conversation, at which Aislin seemed to be talking to a friend of his who knew the American who was planning to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Aislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
In Instagram was threatened by a private military company called Wagner.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark on Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight against the terrorists of the so-called "Islam State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially entered the L.A.S.L. and took an oath.
Aislin's friends and loved ones called Johnny, and in the social media, he's more famous under the name Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know if we're together or not.
But it won't be easy, you'll have to find it...
You asked me to come with you, I agreed if it was okay.
Thank you, before you need to, you've done so much for us, we're very grateful to you.
If you don't ever want to write to me, I'll wait
Hello Natali, please water the flowers outside, by the front door.
I'd like to learn the Czech language, too.
I'd like you to get some rest and think about yourself.
Now you're gonna have to wear face cream)
Yeah... thank you very much. I didn't even expect to get to me such a man, health and luck!!!!!!
Little Dust is not shy anymore?
Ondrej and his father came to visit us.
No one else came in, even though there was a lot of strollers on the street.
We're home today.
The kids have taught classes, they're playing.
I have to go to Lydle for food after lunch.
You have me.
You know I love you.
I'll do anything for you.
How can I prove that love?
I want a chance for us to be together.
To prove it to you.
You may have had many disappointments.
Let me make you happy
Grandma won't be able to, her legs are very painful and cross-cut.
And how much does it cost to rent a double flat in Prague?
Will all the parents come?
It's almost the same.
Family is good, I have my mom, three brothers and a man.
A brother in the wars in Mariopole, the second in Zaporizha, and a man from Kyiv today was transferred to Harkow.
The phones say every day that everything's okay, and if anyone knows him, they won't tell the truth anyway.
I'd like to see you, but I'd still like to sort things out.
I'll ask the man in the morning if he can make it tomorrow.
When you get home, write me, please, I'd need to talk to Daniel.
The big-time attackers for their loss were playing full-time in the fight.
A teacher, Dmitr Paulisky, was shot by an unknown relative, a young man named Boris Alexander.
Their bodies have been thrown into a “threatening pit that has been sown by the earth”.
There was “a dead silence in the city”.
Severely, one of the residents ran from the house to the house.
On the streets, the bodies of the Bolsheviks rolled up were all the time.
And I might actually follow you, I need you, I can't without you.
3. What kind of activity/activity would help you or your friends to adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won't, because the railroad remodeling is closed down.
You get to the bridge where the remodeling is, tell me you've come and I'll come to you
A Better Future Forewarns
Lena things we didn't fit in size, to give you or can you give to Katy

I just wake up very early in the morning without an alarm.
I sleep four to five hours, but I'm already asleep.
Marina couldn't wake me up today when we got here) But it takes time to pass
If I get it right from school, send us an entry letter to talk to the menu
Well, we'll try to take us to social services Tuesday.
Then, when the fill is cold and the plate is ready, the blind cakes and the frying of them on a small fire on the oil.
Okay, I'm sure to ask him.
As soon as we get ready tomorrow night, I'll pick it up on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, for that was the last hope, indeed.
I am not afraid of work, as I lived in the countryside too, so I can and I like to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition, we do this at Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved the law-promoting object 7176, which is called "To advance the monitoring of potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the field of the economy."
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics has turned out to be the place that members of the Watching Board of Tenders and Banks are meeting.
Initiators believe that making decisions by the Superintendent's Board of Superintendents in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of national security in Ukraine.
We know that there are a lot of new threats to the hosts, but we don't know yet about any company that has come up with the need to physically hold a watchdog session at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is a wonderful basis for “removing” all the gains in the hard-won reform of the post-revolution of Greeds, including independent oversight of the board, and then setting up manual management.
It's like it was by 2015.
Why do the watchdogs have to go to the board, and who should come in?
Moreover, if one harmful law-promoting object "flys" under patriotic slogans, there are also others that can fly out tomorrow – for example, the system of public purchases through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot of stuff can be written off for war.
By the way, this initiative was launched before the beginning of the war and the legal object 7176.
So on February 22, this rule was added to the comparative table of subject 5397.
In general, the desire to disengage the board in one way or another has been circulating among some of the people’s chosen ones for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but to show the possible consequences of a law - provoking object, let us consider the arguments that explained the need to accept it.
And then we'll put forward our proposals on how to deal with the issue of the management of bondage during the war.
The first deputy of the Minister of the Economy, Dennis Cudin, explained the need for such a novelty with the risk of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make it impossible for remote oversight boards to work.
In other words, the risk is that the board of trustees will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may result in the paralysis of the company's work.
We agree that this is a risk, but will it be able to prevent members of the Watch Tower Board from moving to Ukraine?
Imagine a very cynical situation in which independent members of the watchdog board (who make up the majority of the whole body) offer their personal security above the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
Then, according to the law, they can be released.
And then, more likely, it will result in the loss of the cohort, the necessary watchful joy to make any decisions.
On the other hand, it will not work quickly to appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, as the law requires a competitive selection that lasts an average of 3 to 4 months.
So the 7176 law - provoking decision is more likely than anything to keep the oversight board from losing the ability to make a decision, and instead it will lead to it!
The People's MP, the author of Dmitro Natalia's law-promoting body, provides other arguments for his support.
In particular, he notes that “many businesses, such as the Defence and Industrial Complex (PPC), are now in need of repositioning” and that “it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensational information from the Zoom Vienna”.
For starters, there is hardly any PKK in Ukraine that has oversight of the board.
The Watching Board is not in the Ukroprom Prom, which actually manages almost all of the PKK's strings.
But even in Ucroboronprom, according to the law, the board of trustees has very limited powers, and all of its members perform duties that are not free of charge.
The full power of Ucrobororomi is vested in the Director General, who will, in fact, make decisions as to the need to relocate a PKK business that is part of the business.
In addition, this argument does not stand out for criticism, either, because the 7176 law-promoting object does not make any changes to the law that governs the operation of the PCA.
On his Facebook page, Mr. Dmitro also cites arguments that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments tend to have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of the operation of the host companies and the bankers, but let's try to figure out some of them: “respectful foreign experts at the first word of war,” as early as 2021, leave Ukraine, but remain members of the supervisory board in the state enterprises of Ukraine, with a full salary of a few hundred thousand dollars, while the Ukraine itself is in a real state of war.
First, it's a manipulation -- most of these board members have never lived in Ukraine and have only come here from time to time.
So to say that they're "leaving Ukraine," to say the least, it's not fair.
Second, as a result of the Coroner's Pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the Watchdog Board have long been engaged in online sessions.
This tool is a long-standing tool in world practice, and in very different fields: business, education, medicine, etc.
It is also worth remembering that membership in the Watching Union is not a full-time job.
Typically, these people have other things to do, and that's what electronics help them do.
Third, all of these statements are read as claims to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmitro does not express identical claims to members of the Watch Tower Board, who are Ukrainians?
Because they're not behind the place of their companies, either.
To say the word, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from the watchdog board, and war is just a new opportunity.
Hi, I'm in the Ukraine, looking for options for temporary family support, with me two children.

Yeah, I know what to do.
I'll also be grateful if you'll tell me at the beginning so I can do as you want.
We usually need an adult's passport.
In the Bróvarsk, Vishgorod, and Bučan districts of Kyiv, which have been freed from the occupiers, a double-distressed commanding hour will be introduced.
The direct language of Paulus: "In the towns of Brovarsky, Wishgorod, and Buchanas, which were under Russian occupation and freed by the U.S. Defence Force, the commanding hour has been strengthened!
In the area of these cities and villages, the limits will be from 9 a.m. on April 2 to 6 a.m. on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the shelling, it is strictly forbidden at this time to stay in the streets of the population and in other public places, to travel and to walk.
Residents can only go out when alarm is signaled to get into hiding.
Such limits are imposed to deal with the effects of Russian aggression — to clean up and alter the territory.
The mantle called on people who had left the area for the time being to stay away from coming home.
At the end of Kyiv City, the commanding hour will last from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily.
None of the school sent me anything but a paycheck.

I've already got a bill, I've done it in another bank, because I had to have an account for work.
The Serbian defence budget grew exponentially for a number of years.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested over two billion euro in the modernization of the army, the updating of military technology, and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places on the list of the world's most powerful military states.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the Western countries took a very serious view of the prospect of a possible upheaval in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complex and globalized.

In the MIF of Belarus, it was reported that, on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobrouisk had been detained for force support by the Special Forces.
According to the "Embark" report, men were active in resisting and trying to escape when they were held back.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical institution.
Another was given on-site medical care.
The head of the criminal police of the MAF, Bilorussia Gennady Kazakevich, stated that “the acts of terror on the RB railroad will be severely halted” by the armed forces.
On April 6, it was reported that, on March 30, the police had detained another fellow member of the Belarus railroad, a fellow member of the Baranowitsk branch of the “BCD” and the management of the “BCD” thematic resources in the “Vkontakte and the “Universities” of Valentine Samasyuk.
Where he is now, and in which state he is unknown, @belzhd_live.
By the end of March, at least 40 railroads had been delayed for sabotage in Belarus.
Let me remind you: the formation of the BYpol, declared by the Lukashenka regime to be extremist, continues to call on the whiterows to sabotage rail transport and the infrastructure of Belarus under the Peramoga plan.
The Belarusian "rival guerrillas" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
It is well known that the Russian Federation is hurling its power and technology to fight in the Ukraine.
It's to raise self-esteem.
Do you like to read books?
And on the phone, they don't work for Easter, either?
Can you do that on the phone on any day or not?
Even a specific law was passed on this matter
We've been here for four days, so it's a horror, not a road.
They were heading through the region of Kyiv, the city of Irpin, and there was terror, shooting, sirens.
I love them too.
Silvia, the Mashi from the Cletzans haven't got any money, can we call them?
Yeah, I'll tell them, I think they'll be home.
There are different Muslims, there are fanatics, and there are real believers.
The meaning of jihad is interpreted in a different way by different Muslims.
But to be honest, it's very uncomfortable for me to do it for money.
You've done me a lot of good.
I can do it for free.
For the time being while we're looking for a university, then you'll usually need a permanent stay.
But maybe it's going to have a place to live. (Suching Prague, Brno, and other places)
I'm not far from Prague right now, we have a car, we're ready to pay a part of the rent.
A town or a village does not matter, it is desirable that it be a separate home.
I put something in the waterphone and plugged in two unnecessary shares for which the cost was cut and I can't shut it off.
And also took the money out of the card that they weren't on.
And I don't know what the money was for.
The cost of the repairs is paid by the owner = Mr. Deedina.
Tuesday, stay home and wait for the repair workers.
Do you need a cigarette?
Can we change the mobile rate if you have time? Is it too late?
The US bans investment in the Russian Federation and imposes sanctions on the daughters of Putin
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is implementing new sanctions against the daughters of the RF president Putin, the largest Russian banks of the Alpha Bank, and the Siberbank, and bans all new investments in Russia.
This is in a report on the White House website.
Silverbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, which is owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets that affect the US financial system, and ban US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To that end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
"This step is based on over 600 multinational companies' decision to leave Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, big retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers, such as legal and consulting companies,” is in the White House's statement.
The third step in new US sanctions was to limit the size of Russia’s major public enterprises in the critical field.
This will ban U.S. citizens from dealing with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
A detailed list of Minfin will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of the adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lavrov, as well as the members of the Security Council of Russia, including the ex-president and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Mishustin.
Sanctions disable them from the US financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, the rest of the drive is closed, and I'll come to you.
Vira, can we wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war, I worked as a flight attendant for SkyAp, my mom was a sewer of industrial products, and my son-in-law, Makarchik, went to the orchards.
We had a fine life, but we didn't even think we'd have to run, for we can't hide in the cellar anymore.
I was lucky to find a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we have the hope that we'll get a home for the first time) We can even pay for a room or a flat, but if it's in our pocket.
Cleanness and order are guaranteed.
We don't have bad habits.
Let us be grateful for such help at such a time that is not easy for us.
After lunch, I had a lecture in English and then went to work in the children's room.
There I explained to Margarity how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she's got it all figured out and will do it well.
I also met Miss Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an ad from the pool.
It's a free-of-charge voyage.
You can call the school, Kiera won't pick up the phone, doesn't answer, I don't know if she's in school.
They isolate the Russian office: stop investment and stop the supply.
But we didn't get it.
The army didn't live in our home.
Our home is near the military unit and the naphtobasa
He just helped me because I couldn't do it on my own.
I cook well, I don't ask too much, and I give good advice
I'm giving myself advice.
It's kind of hard for me, but I know I have to go through this stage.
I'll meet you at Thursday and tell you everything.
Everything's fine.
How often do you clean up?
I clean up every week.
I'm sorry I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I WANTED TO BE A LEARNER
My girls can't move anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I'd like to ask you if you'd listen to the information for the living, you'd let me know.
I'd love to rent a place to live with a decent girl.
If you can know that, let me know.
For my part, I won't let you down.
Thank you in good time.
Hasn't written you another person to Natalie for 54 years. Please write down the exact address and the cost of the course.
I think you'd better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I haven't changed my name, it's one since I was born :)
I'm sorry I didn't see it, I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna send it to you right away.
We're about to go to the medical board.
I mean, we don't have to do this hour on another day.
What day is it best that she arrives early? (Maybe on what day is a bit more work?)
I'll listen to you tomorrow, the Internet is not working well.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thank you. We found something out of the stuff, but there was nothing out of the tech.
Both initials, except the object we know nothing
Nothing's happening.
Can we do it on Monday, 25,04?
Kids can be taken with them, toys enough here :)
I guessed about my dad
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'll think of something about that money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how will it be paid, please, no credit.
Text me straight, and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.
Should we take with us the clothes that have been given?
It's not my day. There's been a break in the living room. One morning.
Something's come from you, I can't see
I'm very sorry, too.
I'll remind you of the fact later.
Are you the only father who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a coworker want to clean up the house, and how many houses have windows?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you.
Raju to read to Joe Dispatch, he's doing scientific research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neurons of links.
Natalia Nagorna, a 1+1 TV journalist, released a video on the morning of April 12, which was handed over to her by the 36th Marine Force from Mariopole.
In it, the soldiers say that they did not have any weapons left to fight, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said, "the count goes for an hour."
Prior to that, April 11, 36th, a separate Marine team involved in the defence of Maryupol, published an address to the Ukrainians in Russian.
It was said that April 11 might be the last fight for the defenders of Mariopole, and the U.S. military command had not been linked to the fighters for two weeks.
In the social media, there was a scepticism that the application was published in Russian.
The Chief Commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valery Valery, has assured us that the command of the defence forces in Mariopole is linked, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of a public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstan factory in Mariopole and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russia’s occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariopole.
According to Azova's leader, Andrew Bieltski, the Russian army has used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which is holding the fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I'll fix it for you, that'd be very good.
The situation is the same as we're still here.
Two hours of driving ) outdoors, Mom shopping and back)!
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she was gonna do here.
The Chechen Drone squadrons have now begun flying over the Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional coppers will serve to detect, and some will serve to direct the destruction of the enemy invader.
Two Zakarpatian and two Czech brothers “birds” sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the MP of the Mukachev city of Volodymyr Lubutenka.
Today, for their inter-green friends led by the village council manager and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Wasil Schoor delivered the drones for their assignment: they were given special units of the Ukrainian forces in various cities, where fighting is ongoing.
For the most efficient and safe use of coppers, we'll keep them in secret for the moment.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what they have done say that in the next few days, many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine to serve the destruction of the Russian occupier and to save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, it's okay. I love sweet, but I can do it without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine soon, and I'm going to keep working.
Okay, if it's okay, I'll take it.
I'll try to do it myself, but if there's a racket, I'll text you, if I may?
The main thing is that we understand each other.
We were personally in the lady's old age in the village of Eve, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no home
Maybe she'll be happy and get her mood up.
I got my phone renovated today.
And I think I'm still on the street today.
I've had medicine and tea, and I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but I'd rather meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, send me the music you like.
I'm interested in what you've got to do with music.
Mom and Dad Should Be Obeyed
You'll find it somewhere near your little brother's carriage.
It's been colder and rainier today, and it's gonna be warm tomorrow.
But it's not a pity the houses have been demolished, the people who are being bullied by the occupiers.
In Herson, the occupiers were offended by the "Slave Ukraine" monument in Herson on the street of Perekopsky.
Details: It is noted that unknowns have torn the flag of the European Union, shredded the panels with images of the Celestial Hundreds and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The occupiers tore off the portraits of the heroes of the Celestial Hundreds and the dead in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The flag's down.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for the stroller, we don't have that custom, so we didn't know, we gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else had to be given.
There's someone in Czech to talk to.
'Cause I live in a kind of community up to 12 people here, and then they go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I was in the crèche today.
Even today, I've been sleeping there.
So we are making great progress.
I'm sure I'll bring the cookies another time!
I don't have the power to make them.
Since I'm being pushed away from the day and time when I have a job cleaning apartments after the guests, I can say something about April of the month, because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning the apartments.
For the month of May, I can say about it at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
I was just wondering if you had anything to say about it.
Hey, I'm sorry I didn't write out for a long time and I had a little sleep.
If you don't mind, can I come today?)
or meet you after you're here)
He's been a modest, recent student, and he's got a lot to learn.
Hey) it went very well.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people in this high office.
Today I learned a lesson from a lady who is the head of the economics department of the edge of highland.
She was very content with my work.
Grisko in the crèche was doing well.
On Monday, I have to bring a confirmation of the work, as well as the money for the crèche.
I'm on Friday
I don't do anything but do a lot of them and sleep . . (and drink a lot of water )
If he goes to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you, if I may.
I have to deliver another analysis
You don't have to go again.
It's not working well, it's washing, it's not working well, it's needing a master, it's got to be fixed.
So it's enough.
Can you send me the correct e-mail address?
I'd like to send you an invitation to a course in the Czech language for which you have signed up.
And the children are fed there, or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment, you can come up with one question.
If you need a help, write
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating Easter tonight, right?
From the start, we didn't really want you to raise money, so people don't think we're hot on it!
But I didn't have two points to fill out online:
I'm gonna go to bed for rest, get some energy, get some energy, and thank you for the present.
This is a great idea, and I'm going to see the video, and it's going to be good, because the whole family is going to draw.
The University of Carazine calls on employees and students to check any information carefully, not to trust anonymous sources in mesengiers and social media, rumors and gossip.
Focus on official information only.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in the country, is also helping the army.
I got some work for the portfolio.
After the holidays, we have to do the Internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How do I count the day I was not at work is a rendition
HQ summary: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Predinaster region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighbouring state."
Realistically, “the military forces of the Russian Federation are not excluded from provocation in the territory of the Predinastrian Region of the Republic of Moldova for the purpose of accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring State.”
Details: The adversary is continuing to create an opportunistic group of troops for action in the Slotian direction.
In the nearest days, the invaders are likely to try to re-energize the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and dispatch a special contingent, weapons, and equipment to participate in combat activities in the territory of Ukraine.
The training of the armament and military equipment is under way at the site of the permanent deployment of the 60th single Moto-Strike Brigade (Monastre) of the 5th General Armed Forces of the Eastern Military Region.
It is likely that the weapons will be moved to the temporary area of the Donetsk region.
Also, in order to recover the loss of a special unit of the Battalion Tactical Team, a total of 36 individual motor-stroke brigades (Borgia, Zabaikale Land) of the 29 General Armed Forces of the Eastern Military Region are being recruited from a designated brigade.
A particular problem is that the enemy is experiencing the recruitment of drivers and driver mechanics.
The selection of the selected individual from the permanent position is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the opponent, in order to disrupt the supply of trucks to combat sites, will continue to strike the transport infrastructure in the territory of Ukraine for the purpose of destroying or derailing them.
The designated sub-units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the tasks of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Blorussian border in the Brest and Gomel oblasts.
On the Slovitic side, individual units of the 6th General Army and the North Navy have continued to block part of the city of Harkow, and have continued with artillery shelling of individual areas of the city.
In the Isosyan direction, the area is being surveyed for the purpose of detecting the position of the U.S. Armed Forces.
The opponent uses the Orlan 10 drone for this.
By force of two Battalion Tactical Groups, the enemy tried to strike in the direction of the localities of Longenke and Dimitrovk, without success, and went to pre-occupied positions.
On the Donetsk side, the main effort continues to focus on taking control of the localities of Popasna, Rubizna, Lower, and Novobakhmutka, as well as the full control of the city of Mariopole.
The enemy tried to launch an attack in the Golden Area, and it didn't work.
In the city of Mariupol, the occupiers continue to storm the Azovstan plant and the port of the sea by means of artillery and air.
By the forces of individual sub-units, the enemy carried out artillery shellings of the positions of the Ukrainian forces in the areas of the population of the High-Scopill, the Trumpet and the Mariansk.
In the area of the Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts, Ukraine's protectors over the past year have been struck by four enemy attacks, five tanks, eight units of armoured vehicles, six units of vehicle technology, and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Don't you get your point?
We'll usually try to make it, but I doubt it.
And how can you sleep and I'll hold you up?
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I'll get it.
We didn't watch TV at home, and we don't have to set up :)
I'm gonna turn on the TV just to listen to the language of the Czech.
I'm running out of the month-rate package today :)
Can we do that on the phone today?
Buy tissue for embroidery, jaws, threads for embroidery
I mean, I can make the material in this field.
I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us so much pie.
I'll meet my father later, I'll be sure to.
I've read the facebook presentation, so Google must have written something in his own way.
Good day, we're the things you brought, but there are things that we're small can bring you in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about the job.
If the headmaster does, I can start work next week because I'm planning to go to the office tomorrow afternoon to get the papers (if you get very big queues) and on Saturday rain :)
I'm looking for a team at the start, very fond of chemistry at school, learning the Czech language to know perfectly, dreaming of working in Tevy
Friends of old and not very well, friends I don't know personally, friends of spirit and mind.
Now you too have had a hard time.
For the last month, I've been in touch with a lot of you.
Your life, which was never easy, turned from foot to head, as did the life of every country.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have confessed to being guilty and ashamed by the actions of your country in relation to your neighbors.
Because they're giving up Ukraine in your name.
Some of you actives have been at risk for a long time, and you've been preparing for a critical blow.
In early March, I wrote Alexander Čercasov, a very old friend of Memorial.
Let's tell you a little bit later, ” as normally said by Sasha. “ Now, after we've been searched, we're walking through the ruins.
Others — artists, artists, critics, writers — are astonished by the sudden collapse of your small world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of the very few of you -- those who worked for Memorial, in the New Gazette, in the Echo of Moscow, in the Medusa, in the Navaya and in a number of other places -- did many of you do anything to oppose this regime?
Except for participating in the rally when it was still happening.
Read the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to keep quiet"
If so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is more than just abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy, and your passive association, which may now have put a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like that.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had to a certain extent enjoyed freedom and democracy – a messy, even bloodthirsty, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why, every time you finally have a revolution, do you end up in so much fear of grief that you seek salvation behind the King's back, may his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel safer around him.
Indeed, mistakes have been made.
Instead of grabbing and publishing the KGB Archives, as the Germans in the stamps did, you took your soul to the monument of Dzerzynski – and let the KGB lay low, refresh, reform, and take control of the country.
When you were asked to choose between theft of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option, and humbly accepted theft.
In 1998, your economy fell, and that marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival was the main concern.
Then there was Putin, young, businessly, aggressive, and he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you fell for it, but you either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to rebalance Chechnya with the ground, most of you had eyes on it.
I remember well those years.
I was working in Chechnya to help the victims of the Putinian "antiteroristic operation," and I saw with my eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kali, and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I had witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You said to me, "No, we're fed up with your Chestnut." I remember that very well.
In return, I resented, "Friends, it's not my Chechen, it's your Chechen.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your authority that bombes one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too hard, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic upturn in the middle of zero, due to the rising oil prices and the willingness of Putin to look through his toes at the fact that some of the money that was stolen would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made good money, some have been rich, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found a better job.
The price's up, but what's wrong?
Moscow was shining and shining from the neck.
When a number of opponents were killed – Yuri Chickichin, Anna Politski, Alexander Litwinkin, and others – many of you were shocked and expressed horrors about what was happening.
However, the matter did not go any further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of president Medvedev, and sat down as the prime minister, I see you're barely paying attention to it.
When Medvedev Russia invaded Georgia after a few months of rule, most of you ignored it or said no.
How many of you have I met in the next years on the hills of Goodauri, in the front of the Edge or in the cafés and in the Turkish tubs of Tbilis, while a part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit, I don't think we did much in the West, if we did anything at all.
A little resentment, a little sancing; but what was the point of Russia’s outright violation of international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and the domestic market?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the hard 1990s, it was the most important thing.
But at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, did wake up.
When Putin changed places again with Medvedev and sat down the president's office, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you massed the protest.
The name Navalny became a pronoun, you didn't walk out of the street for half a year, and the regime finally felt horrified that it was losing the ground under its feet.
He then struck back.
Initially, alternative actions were organized, and more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have been given huge terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"It's so strong, and we're so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Disturbed by the pro-Russia president, who deluded their European expectations, they once seized Maydan – and never left him.
They completely built a tent town on their own and prepared for strong defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
The runner was Yanukovic, and the Ukrainians had restored democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and to banish them if they failed to do their job.
Maydan was very displeased with Putin.
That was a bad example.
So, using the general confusion, he captured the Krem.
Some of you were against it, but there was little good.
And how many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russia's citizens supported anecdotes.
All of a sudden, a new myth was born, and many of you, who disdained Putin and his gang, suddenly returned 180 degrees and adored it.
I find it hard to find a reason, since right after that we stopped talking.
The rest of my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you hid yourself in books, movies, IKEA catalogs, and parks, as new after the restoration, which was started by Moscow in 2012, with their bingoes, the popular wiphoes, and the hipster cafés.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's just getting better.
You've drawn close to Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't there?
IDILE or whatever, even the Moscow editor who released my book on Syria criticized it in an interview, because I had little idea of what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I was on my way there and I've seen the state snipers shoot cold-blooded at my children's peers on the streets.
Among all the citizens of Russia, only your soldiers had been there, who in 2015 had begun to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first, they came out of socialists, but I said no, because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came to the trades, but I was quiet, because I'm not a professional.
Then they came after the Jews, but I was silent, for I am not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left to say anything to protect me."
How many of you have spoken of Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority of them said nothing.
Some really talk now – like Dmitro Glaukhovsky, Michael Shishkin, Michael Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most people are allowed to speak from abroad, some from the interior of the country, like Marina Ovsalnikov, risking getting into the new GULAS or putting up a company called Nawalny.
As for others, you know best the country in which you live.
So, I'm sure you understand, when Putin's dealing with the Ukrainians -- or, which seems very likely, if he doesn't, he's gonna do it for you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who courageously, but mostly alone, have protested, and have so far been insignificant, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed dissent in social media (let's have a black square in Instagram) or who have spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The time when 10 or even 25 years of disfellowshipping were given just for anecdotes is not in this distant past – and now they are very likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who, then, will speak for you?
The example of the Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be combated.
And that mind, motivation, and courage can stop it, no matter how depressing it might be on the paper of its advantage.
In view of everything, few in Russia are aware of this, as is the fact that war is going on.
But you, my friends, know very well what's going on.
You read TV news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine that you keep in touch with.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be alert.
You know what this is all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just jokes, your laws, if you don't consider the oppressive, don't cost more than the paper they're on, your last free media is gone, your economy is crashing faster than I'm writing, you don't have credit cards to buy a ticket to the plane abroad, even if there's still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be content with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to go or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you're seeing another option.
Still, there's still one.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And maybe under the conditions that you're in, you're gonna need less of you than you think.
Think about it.
It's not from you: because of the economic collapse in Russia, it's likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When the prices go up and the wages go down, the people who have voted for Putin for all these years, wanting bread and peace, will go out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, or you, my friends.
But if each city goes out to the rally by itself, as it has done on a periodic basis, it won't be hard for it to stifle them alone.
We need an organization and a coordination. The crowd will need to be converted to a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool, an Internet that can limit the mode, but that still works, and that can be set up under almost any circumstances.
Navany's organization has been shattered, but you can create other, more informal, more decentralized.
There are a lot of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly a hundred thousand.
If it's over 300,000, it'll be stunned.
We're gonna have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to it?
After all, what did he force them to do in Ukraine, all that he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will have a clear fear; but those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I'd be afraid if I were you, too.
In Syria, and now in Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happened to those who dared to ignore their master, who dared not only to demand freedom, but was really trying to get it.
But even if you don't do anything, the lives of countless people will still be lost for nothing.
Your son will drop the joke in chat-chat computer games – and be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the Internet – and be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake – and die in a gray cell under the police batons.
And that's what's been going on for many years, and it's just gonna get bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know what's gonna happen.
Act in cold blood, think strategicly, and make it a reality.
We were Friday at class, we were told we could come on Monday
We'll be home at night.

As a prokurator, I thought I was going to build a career, I wasted a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex mental, responsible, mental work that I was completely disappointed in.
It's a pity for the time lost, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am communistic, but love and marriage are taken seriously.
There was a man I had to marry, but he died, a heart problem.
I believe that in order to create a family, people must love, respect, trust one another.
Now, I haven't met that.

Mr. Reyhardt, I'm sorry I'm bothering you at the wrong time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie's playroom today, to say hello to her.
She was in a bad situation.
Because when the children went home, one mom refused to take the baby, because she said that she had come to look at things and put them in that dress room and that Mr. Valery had opened up our baby's room by 7:00 last night.
Can that really be the case?
It's working time for the room at 4:00.
And eventually, it's our responsibility.
