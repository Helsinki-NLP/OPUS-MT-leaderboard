Republican Strategy to Resist Obama's Re-Elect
The Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat falsification in the elections.
At the Brennan Center, however, the latter is viewed as a myth, arguing that falsifications in the United States are rarer than deaths from a lightning strike.
In addition, Republican jurists counted only 300 cases of electoral falsification in the United States in 10 years.
One thing can be said with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions are in part discrediting the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the US.
That is why most state governments have enacted laws since 2009 that complicate the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon gained a new dimension after the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states had been passed in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require the voter to present a photo identity card and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register the elector on the day of the expression of will, and remove the right to vote from citizens holding a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no state in the United States required voters to produce a photo identity card.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a claim.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated draft laws obliging voters to produce photo identification cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have the same universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people who have reached the voting age, do not have an identity card with a picture issued by the state government.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have a similar document.
However, the cost of obtaining the required identity card is often over $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over the age of 65, and 20 per cent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo identification.
But that's not all.
Students who are considered to vote for Democrats are not allowed in several states to use the photo identity card issued by their educational institution.
At the same time, the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for the Republicans, to use the licenses issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required proof of American citizenship to vote.
For the first time, a similar request was made in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are US citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latin Americans.
It is believed that two thirds of Latin American voters vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators initiated laws in 2011 to abolish voter registration on polling day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wished to register.
That limit did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to put about 10 million citizens on the list.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the voter registration rate in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, national legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although the latter represented only 13 per cent of the total number of voters in the state.
The same was true of Latin Americans.
They represented only 11 per cent of the voters, accounting for 24 per cent of the citizens who had voted in advance.
In contrast to the whites, who make up 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the voters voted in advance.
Of course, Democrat legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
A number of draft laws have been enacted by the Democrat Governors.
The most controversial laws had been suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney-General.
This has made it possible to limit the negative effects in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring photo identification.
Nevertheless, the new rules that have come into effect will certainly impede the exercise of the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Democrat critics condemn the bias of laws that have been adopted, with a clear focus on influencing the 2012 elections in key states.
The report of the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the states that passed the laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the Bench to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
There is no doubt that these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions are in part discrediting the system of American democracy.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Perform a Test or Not?
In fact, the PSA test produces sometimes incorrect results, false, and sometimes false, that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, who are so reluctant to go into dispensary, have much more to question.
Do you want to pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Studies in the United States have found many cases of infection among the study teams, so it is difficult to interpret the data and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found different levels of death for patients who had been screened and for those who had not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastasis is 30-40% higher for those who have not been screened.
So I'd recommend a test from the age of 50, or 40, if a direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also at high risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and vintage.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering him options, without the mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which is not life-threatening in the long term, and by making a choice, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
To date, many of the men diagnosed with cancer will not receive treatment, as their cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we'll start the treatment.
Increasingly, we are setting the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I'd recommend that we go through the test.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not you need to take the test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember has developed a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

To prevent a disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recept to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in scientific research, healthy lifestyles remain the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people had been well fed and moved enough, 30 percent of the cancers could have been prevented.
"If no one else had smoked, that figure would have increased to at least 50%," stressed Andre Bolieu, Spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking accounts for 85% of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes immense harm to human health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says Spokesman Andre Bolet.
An encouraging fact is that 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is halved.
Weight
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," they add to the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends limiting the use of red meat.
In too many cases, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salinity can lead to carcinogens.
"The latter can harm the body's cells and lead to cancer," explains the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been researching the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies are not clear.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies produce conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
There is also a lack of clarity in the assessment of the impact on the development of vitamin D cancer.
However, he stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family history with the doctor.
"References don't lead to cancer."
Higgs Boson in Details
In the past summer, the report that scientists may have been able to locate Higgs' boson has caused real alarm - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson accounts for the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, it is the last particle that was predicted to exist in the Standard Model - our best, or, at least, the "lowest imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter - but that had not been discovered in the past.
But physicists aren't sure it's the Higgs Boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we're dealing with a really new particle, and that it's a lot like the Higgs Boson that was predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical convention in Kyoto seem to support this, although some data are not yet available for full certainty.
Let's just say this is the Higgs boson, because the chances of error seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things can't end up in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to get past this rule, don't even try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that there is also one law of this nature: the principle of excluding Paulie, which posits that two particles cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same “quantum state” - this “state” is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Physics, therefore, divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called the farmer, who are wisely subject to the principle of Paulie.
In the other, the bosons, the abominable gang of anarchists, have no respect for anything - at least this principle, which means that they may be at the same place at the same time.
According to the website (something very unusual) Partile Adventure of Berkeley Labs, these bosons are in turn divided into two groups: the mesomons we're not going to talk about, and the "partikels of power" by which the main forces of nature are spread, and which in some way include the Higgs Boson.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as might be thought of.
In fact, if you can read this chronology, it's thanks to one incredibly trivial boson: photon, or "part of the light," which is the "courier" of electromagnetic power.
In fact, when a single particle with an electric charge accelerates or shifts its direction, it "breaks" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, about like a stone thrown into the pond.
This “violation” produces an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon, and therefore one of the “power carriers”.
A more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs Boson, with the only difference that for this boson to emerge, another field, the Higgs field, must be "broken."
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to energize it, you have to achieve very, very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only shake a very big stone.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that's operating in CERN, the Great Adronic Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 kilometers!, to achieve such huge energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs Boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to the fridge.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like photon, by the way) do not.
So, what "can bring" all this research, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to test the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to see the difference between the observations and the projections of the SM.
In addition, some of them fervently yearn to see such a discrepancy, because the slightest incompatibility can open the door to "new physics" and shut some of the Model holes.
The last one, let's say, still has significant shortcomings, without suggesting any explanation for gravity (a!) or for the dark matter that forms about 80 percent of the universe (a!).
But so far, there are no such discrepancies in CERN.
Effect
It is harder to predict from these studies for the day-to-day life of the average, but it would be a mistake to assume that there is no.
See, in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in Bella's labs couldn't even think of a revolution that would trigger their work.
They foresaw their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who was working at the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previously impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was originally viewed as a more "labular gadget".
Imagine...
And in addition, an app can be found for the tools that accompany the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optic studies in 1969.
This sensor, although not at all his original purpose, is now a “eye” for all digital cameras in the world and has won the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will make a difference in our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative help is the best way to die...
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec had recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
Debates are about to resume, and a bill is being drafted.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
"The Long" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Monterrey.
Prostate cancer that destroyed him from the inside gave him a two-year extension.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor Gadbua's palliative exit home in Beloy the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet on your own or even eating on your own.
As he sits at a table where he has a good meal, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He wakes up, even gets to smile, to talk to strangers who work around him, to bring him drugs, to take him to the bathtub.
Courage before a normal death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"For the rest of our lives, we are taught that a man should pee standing up," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victor Gadbua shelter.
Regression to the condition of the child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"Everything depends on a person's ability to accept the decline," he claims.
Because, in the midst of this decline, important events have occurred in the view of many paralytic caretakers.
Patients who go to Victor Gadbua's palliative shelter are all cancer patients.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of physicians and nurses no longer provides care, called “Healthing”.
Mrs. A., 89, is the most afraid of dying "in a state of asphyxiation."
But the disease made me know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before I let her put a mask that makes her breath easier.
She still awaits her son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
At the Victor Gadbua shelter, a group of volunteers provide body care and food support.
This is a palliative care that stays when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
Québec has one place in palliative care for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That's not enough, given that we're all gonna die sooner or later.
This is where life goes on under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at the shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or emotional.
To the dying, we'll agree to give the lipsticks of brandy or pepsi, whatever he asks.
Diabetes are no longer forced to control sugar levels.
And death is part of the day-to-day routine.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died last night.
His son drank that beer in the dead man's legs this morning.
"We help loved ones as well as patients," says Natalie Sawar, director of nursing.
Victor Gadbua's shelter doesn't look like the last day.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the courtyard, resting on his pillows during a toast to his honor, a 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children, dies tragically, and has tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, between three and five beds, always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christian Martel is concerned.
53 per cent of the patients admitted to the Victor Gadbua shelter come from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor Gadbua shelter and the Greater Montreal House Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this huge gap in Québec’s health system that has led many palliative care doctors to fear a law legitimizing euthanasia and suicidal care.
Beginning in October, a manifesto signed by the stewards in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mountain and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, has been circulating and demonstrating their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Québec's health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative care of high quality before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the E.R. in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to make it easier.
I'm afraid the only reason the patients want to die is because they don't get proper care.
At the same time, many oncologists have been trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
Ellen Richard's hope of survival was already minimal when she stopped exhausting chemo.
When I told my oncologist that I was terminating the treatment, she said that she regretted that I was ending the fight, she said.
She told me that my days were numbered!
There's no all-powerful care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team has eased their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Society, patients are not receptive to pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to a palliative session in which the patient sleeps until his death, either occasionally or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we don't know about this suffering.
Increasingly, patients who are unable to ease the pain will be able to access a palliative session.
People with pain always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want to get euthanasia," it means "I want to get better."
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute of Health Studies of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political party fund-raisers and Italian Mafia professionals tell day after day what they know about the huge “system” of the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
The industry, which was very expensive to Quebec's taxpayers, particularly in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how this system disintegrates after all the means have been put into action, "is joked by Jacques Duceno, the MP and the former Chief of the Montreal Police."
It was because of it that a scandal erupted in 2011 as a side-effect of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the then liberal Prime Minister, Jean Share, had very reluctantly agreed.
The Duceno Report has established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“Since the investigation began in 2010, he stresses that the Department of Transport alone would have kept a billion dollars on contracts” if some had held back their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonno Commission “has already removed the two mayors,” he adds, hoping that it will be able to “discover the charts behind the individual”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, was involved in the case, which included a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, members of the special unit Molote, who, after 2009, had forced the Montreal “bottom cartel”, to stop overstatement of the contract value.
A series of searches had been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Marcott, the mayor of a small town, had been charged with fraud and corruption.
The next is Gilles Wyangcourt, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third-largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected of receiving multiple bribes in the placement of public orders.
In addition, a number of route engineers from Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurto and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
The last one blew up a real bomb, telling us the investigation of the "system" of getting government contracts.
For a number of years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to a Mafia broker who, in turn, transferred the money of Mayor Gérald Trumblé's Party, United Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambito soaked money to the right and left, and he transferred over 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 Euros) to the various parties in the province, mostly the liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Excessed value contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked unrelentingly.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts, the value of which he overstated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted to having received 30 to 40 per cent of the bills on their paws by means of false additions.
Then a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Trumple of deliberately turning his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party's cash with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, putting Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal Roulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of Rivier de Prairie County, in the east of the island, has been opposing the sale of a five-million-dollar municipal site since 2010 and resold to... 1.6 million developers in the middle of the building boom.
70% of the dirty money in the campaign
She says that in an investigation that will eventually be launched, it “will draw a thread to understand the functioning of the ant-infested system to stop gangrene and identify the perpetrators”.
It is a process that is characterized by a “sick but positive” process.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of dubious practices.
How we clean up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Duceno notes, for his part, that “workers stole hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is particularly concerned about the role of the “elective officials who knew about the scheme” but who did not participate in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in funding the Quebec campaign is 70%, he jokes, "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Québec government is proposing to limit to $100 a donation to the parties, but, according to him, it won't change the situation: "Until we restrict the cost of the election, the politics will be dirty money."
It calls for a complete restructuring of the system of State contracts and party financing: “We cannot go down below; with boldness in mind, we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duceno calls upon those who laugh to look in their own courtyard ...
"SVU is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've achieved an extraordinary spike at the SVU.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by the new dimension of the SWAP.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical staff have also made a great deal of progress.
These factors make me go up the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
It's all happening very fast in football.
But I don't break up.
From the very start, I've always been moving forward at the NIF Pre-Training Centre in Clerfonten, and until I got to St. Etienne.
So you're benefiting from the competition established by Carlo Anchelotte...
It's not new to play very high-level games to fill this summer.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to a player like me wanting to be at the level and to put it to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotte is supporting my position.
He's being helped by deputies like Claude McEllet, who played in the same position as I did.
Ancelotte is the master of the position?
Sure.
Ancelotti is a respectable tool for all technical staff.
Today, he is one of the best coaches in Europe in the First League.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with the big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I left a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the SVP season?
In the First League, Lyon took the lead from us.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have effectively qualified for the 8th final.
What's the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, it can be.
We can say our word face-to-face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to accept the match back in one of the eight finals.
Will the CSW be able to become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that...
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and fortify positions for the long term.
That's not true today.
Financially, the WSW has the means to make this project real.
Not to take the title in the First League, like last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to get this championship title.
Last season, we were close to it.
In May, it was a disappointment, because we had everything to get to the end first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Typically, 79 points presuppose the title of champ.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Even though strong teams like Marcel, Lyon, and Bordeaux have come to fight for the title, I think we have the power to win.
Don't you think the media expect too much from the SVU?
It's normal that we're expected to do a lot, given how much money we've invested and how many players we've got.
We're all ready for that.
On the other hand, when we're at home winning 4-0 against Trua, and we're still found to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people want us to do first.
We can never win every weekend with a 4-0 score.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proved in the League of Champions that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who has not been able to make it to the 8th finale for two seasons, even though they have also spent a lot of money!
In view of the sums invested, we represented you 15 points ahead by the winter break.
It would be a disdain for our opponents and for the French championship.
Leon and Marcel, who weren't at the top last season, were "energized" by this new SVU.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
SVP seems to be entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovich's feats.
So what if they say there's some sort of "Golden Dependence."
This only means that Ibrahimovich is very successful and has scored a lot of heads.
He's come for this and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-wide star.
In the group, we respect him as a man and a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
This also encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro2012 with the French team?
How frustrating.
I fervently wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma has prevented me from wasting some game time.
I saw a lot of things out there, and I got out more.
Today, I'm doing a good selection match.
That's what I've been hoping for since I got baptized at the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and we must now be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham at the head of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He's got a good position in the selection team for the World Cup.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players, and he inspires us to win.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc has achieved his goal, he has qualified us for the euro.
I hope Didier Desham brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved tie (1-1) hurled out on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us confidence in ourselves.
Everyone's been fighting for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, my career had never had a match like this.
To pay and sell without the help of the banks - with Bitcoin
Total contrast to the current exchange of money, based on central banks numbered transactions between receiving parties with commission fees for processing.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, there is a clear political vision: the belief that the current currency system, consisting of banking monopolies, is causing financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, Euro ...) and a secure protocol of the BitTorrent type, which allows for the exchange of files between the same level.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand websites accept bitcoins for donation or as a payment.
At a maximum of $30 (23 Euro) in June 2011, Bitcoin fell to $2 five months later before returning to about $10 today (curriculum is listed on Bitcoincharts.com).
It's not a big deal compared to the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in the system in its October Virtual Currency Report.
He describes Bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “like the normal currency”.
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currency, such as “credits” used to promote in a video game that is made by the game or that can be bought (and sometimes traded).
Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central body.
In Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are both keepers of the book of accounts, auditors, issuers of the currency, buyers and sellers.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between the two users actually occurs between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
For each new payment, the user can select a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relevant to the transaction is signed electronically using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is possible to check that the bitcoins used in the transaction do exist in a public account that is distributed all over the network.
The key step is to record a new transaction in the book.
It's going through a math problem sent to computers that, like a temporary central bank, has the privilege of adding this new line.
This is the hash phase of the file, i.e. converting a large file to a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hash" all together.
The aim is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the start).
As soon as this number is found, the other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
Transaction is thus consistent with the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If the user wanted to pay the same money twice in less than ten minutes for the purpose of deceit, only one of the two transactions would have been confirmed by the network - and the other one would have been unsubstantiated, since they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the award is regularly split in half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, leaving a reserve...
The difficulty of the task is also increasing with an increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already survived ups and downs.
The Bitcoin sites were attacked, and the Bitcoins were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect used does not concern the protocol itself," states Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a company that pays with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this shortcoming.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as WordPress blogs, are allowed to do so.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizman Institute in Israel, analyzed the account book and found that almost 80 percent of the Bitcoins are not in circulation.
“Gigant sales” were announced in November.
"Thirty-thousand dollars have been exchanged," lamented Jon Holmquist, who works at Coinabul, who converts Bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of the currency benefit, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or an uncontacted payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to test transactions, which is less expensive.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to give an address that can be "photo-recognized" by a phone, and Pierre Nuaza, assuring him that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to re-evaluate hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin is established, it will take some time, but 2013 may be a turning point," he foretells.
The ECB's report suggests, by the way, a rethinking of the range of risks that are considered to be high today if the system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French forces left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapiza and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just for us.
We have been the main victims of the Afghan peasants, whom we saw as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 dead soldiers, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former commanders fleeing in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case in the USSR.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are put up with, and sometimes help from local rebels, but they will no longer be as soon as the West acts more delicately.
The departure of the French forces from the Nijrab base, which I had observed from the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credit, was in order.
Truck and armoured convoys accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban attacks on Kabul since the end of 2014.
The situation has changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the fighting between different groups.
Taking control of the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have been paid for the gloomyness of these peasants, who have been outnumbered by al-Qa`idah, but their situation has not improved today.
The former Mujahids, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the Anti-Soviet War returned to power in 2001.
They have become businessmen who take over public land to resell them to returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge United States sub-contracts.
They're discredited; most of them, by the way, didn't even fight themselves.
People, as I hear in the countryside, want a government that is not a thief.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have succeeded in American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; there are now 5 million people in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in urban areas are filled with both boys and girls.
These young people need to be given jobs, who will not want to return to the obscurity of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed militants, love mobile phones, TV, and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and who watch everywhere.
At the moment, there is an army.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The anti-Soviet commanders are already taking steps to restore provincial wives who would not be subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to a certain degree, modelled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to transform it into a central State with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even before, has been dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, and no irrigation system has been renovated.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruit.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by the war of 30 years, State control of the infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan possesses huge mineral wealth.
This only increased the feeling that the Western countries were there to take possession of them.
Without the power to process iron ore or copper on the ground, without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Ainak Copper Field, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and to remain the province's largest employer.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, re-establish normal relations one day.
The withdrawal of the French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provided for the maintenance of traditional assistance: girls ' faces, boys, French language department at the University, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and support for an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “conquer hearts and minds” and to perform the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the “military-civilian activity” service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French social organization, has contributed to a large number of community work and activities aimed at the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These efforts, with intensive local labour, have helped to contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection, and an increase in arable land.
What will we leave to remember ourselves by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, which is very harsh in these valleys, often at a height of over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, as the farmers have told me, we need to give them a little non-military support that is well under control and direct access to them.
Difficult birth of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt was more divided than ever, on the question of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, it had decided to play a waffle.
After surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two extra months to complete the work.
Soon, two years ago, Egypt had relied on the preliminary text, which had been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratical delusions” by continuing to “violation of the word” and “violation of the right”.
In the camp, his followers are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article after article.
For the President, it is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems confident that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview to American weekly Time.
Especially since the call for a fast-track vote is like an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: “Or you vote for my text, or I leave myself with extraordinary powers”, which is expected to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, most of them Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to deliver their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, the spares, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
Not surprisingly, in most cases the articles had been voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, have been amazed by the fact that one of the few differences of the day arose around... the time for prayer, because some members of the committee felt that the hours of the Congregation had been misconfigured.
The text on which the vote was still held yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, article 2, was ultimately the same as the article in the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the sharia principles are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was a basic requirement, had hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would make it possible to apply them more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that the article had not been changed was a sign of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Physicism," answer the liberals, who see it only as a PR.
Because, in their view, Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of the observance of sharia law.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, since “the people who make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals are also thrilled by the fact that the next president of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
"There is no specific religious intervention at this time.
With this constitution, we remain under civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulemas, but university students, some have been studying in the French system” - comforts Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “circumstances around article 220 may arise, as the terms used in it are taken from religious language.
This is particularly the case with “fikhs” [Islamic jurisprudence, ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent the civilian judges are to rule on it.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday was criticized, as it gave wide powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly smaller than under the old regime.
Another controversial point is the power of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defence budget will take place in the National Defence Council, not in Parliament.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be detrimental to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy had been preserved, and insults were now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles speaks more of the protection of a woman, as Heba Moraeph, from Human Rights Watch, points out.
According to her, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that didn't appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to perform on TV last night, the demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State, in turn, will enter the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy sites, the Pup of Earth and the sea from the skies
The Promised Land combines the greatness of Bible truths, the modern comfort, and the predestination of nature.
AIF identified five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Let's bow to holy places
A visit to the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that everyone who enters this "buyer" has the grace of God.
And Galilee is the place of the wonders of Jesus: to turn water at the wedding into wine, to walk in the water, to calm the storm, and to fill the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all the shrines in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here pass the Path of Troubles or the Holy Way of Jesus (in Latin, Via Doloros).
It begins at the fortress of Antony-Pretorium, where there was a trial, and leads to the temple of the Lord's Tomb on Mount Golgotha, to the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of Salvation, and the place of Jesus' burial.
Here, too, is the figurative Christian Pup of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which a cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jews, the Wall of Cry, which was left of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave notes here with desires that follow.
Make a vertical trip
The ruins of the fortress of Massada remained from the secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great had built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on high mountain rocks at an altitude of 450 m above the sea level.
Only climbers are able to get to them.
The rest of this historic summit is brought by the lift on the cable road.
And in the north of the country, there is a well-known mountain resort, Hermon, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, which is a huge flood of tourists in the winter months.
He's got a shuttle bus at the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski tracks is 45 km.
It is an ancient tradition that pagan gods were supposed to have lived on top of the mountain.
Visits to Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don't go to everyone for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israeli Museum, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls, found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth a visit to the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
His exhibits include the paintings of impressors and expressionists Mone, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Seasley, Matissa, Modillani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al-Bash Museum, which is a series of old-fashioned Turkish baths with suits of visitors and banners at the time.
In Cesarea, you should go to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops.
It is free of charge, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad-Wash in Tel-Aviv, speaks of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the Children's Memorial, was built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas cells.
You go in, you end up in absolute darkness.
The stars are flickering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died sound.
There is also a reference to Ukraine.
Get well.
The three main Israeli resort zones are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each has pools, water parks, dolphins, and oceaniums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is bathed even in the winter months, as the temperature of the water does not fall below 21 degrees of heat, and the air is warmed up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is warmer, and it's been bathed all year.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world at the lowest point of the planet, 417 metres below the ocean level.
The azure water in it is dissolute, easy to keep on the water even if they can't swim at all.
Landscapes are unreally beautiful.
They come here to receive treatment with salty water, spray, and medicinal filth, and to treat the health of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to fix the shaken nerves.
Touch the Secrets of the Ancient
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel-Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the shore of the Mediterranean.
Through it was the famous sea route that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, this is where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beauty of Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of roaming the narrow streets named after the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "my" sign, the Fortune will be favorable.
In Jaffa, you can find newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even from other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Cesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam the Roman theater, "give out" the fortress of the crusaders.
During the Roman period, Cesarea was the main city of Judah and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
A carefully renovated theater is now being used for evening concerts and opera shows.
A Tourist to Notify
When going to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: about 30 percent of the population in the country speaks Russian.
It is best to borrow money for a trip in dollars, not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to trade for shekels (now $1,38).
Urban transport is mostly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa is the country's only subway line, consisting of six stations, linking the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's an underground fuse.
Travel in all modes of urban transport is worth 6 shekels, for which you can travel with transplants for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, it is Jewish tradition to observe the Sabbath Sabbath.
From Friday night to sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport are shut down.
And Sunday morning, the week of work begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes, which combine milk with meat.
It offers a wide selection of lambs and beef, soups and desserts, cooked on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta hummus, a variety of gravy, a hammered nut - phalal, fruit, and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fed cats that are "walking on their own."
Even on the rooftops of parked cars, you can see them sleeping in the evening.
The squirrel likes a crowded place and doesn't give up the treats.
The rental of a car, depending on the stamp, will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And it's gonna cost 15 cents a day to rent a bike.
Museum tickets are on average 30 shekels.
Numbers in language
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
The most traveling and resting citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine had come.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, an increase of 51 per cent over the 2010 figure, prior to the cancellation of the visa on 9 February 2011.
"Great and Powerful" to Moscow will prove that migrants save money in the language
As long as deputies and human rights defenders are arguing that the law on compulsory language testing will give rise to frauds in the country that trade in “leaf” certificates
Each year, 13 million gastrobytes arrive in Moscow, Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to make money to support families left behind.
As of 1 December, the law had entered into force, under which every migrant worker would be required to take the Russian language proficiency exam.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the areas of services, housing and utilities, welfare and retail trade.
In time, however, the FMS promises, the tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
But not just the language, but the Russian history and the basis of the law will have to be surrendered.
Language skills will have to be confirmed for both the receipt and extension of the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the national language.
Nor do people who have had their diplomas and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 fall within the scope of the law.
Benefits, doomsdays and the protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the MGA, the SBGU and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
Both the State Duma and the FMS supported the initiative to introduce testing.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, had many times asked the press, "What will that do?"
What will change the obligation to learn the language for both the Russians and the visitors themselves?
First of all, the migration service responds, which will reduce the number of people suffering from “labour slavery”.
A lot of people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explaining the head of the Russian FMS office in Tajikistan, Victor Seblev.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only a system of organized recruitment will 90 per cent solve the problems of foreign workers.
There are problems for migrants who do not have a profession, an education that does not know the language, and who do not have a medical certificate.
Without an understanding of the language, - I'm sure to myself - the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, put him in a horrendous, narrow barracks, where he and dozens of his kind will be bored for months without food and documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We're getting a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“In their home country, they are promised one thing, and upon arrival they are deceived, they are taken away from their passports, and they do not pay their promised wages,” confirms the Chief of the General Directorate of Labour Migration of the MS Tolib Šaripov.
Don't swear, snitch!
However, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian republics are going to work in Russia, it is recognized that not only do not know the language of the country to which they want to go, but it is hard to write on their own.
Of course, it is not so much their fault but their misfortune: few Turks, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even meaningful primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to feed their children, not to mention proper dressing, dressing, and dressing for school.
As they grow up to be a teenager, they go to work as soon as possible.
It is hard, if it is bad with the knowledge of the language, they will confess.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
True, with regard to the law on language, human rights defenders note an important point.
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have a legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the gastrobyters still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or no extraneous entry."
Many of the visitors claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is the bureaucracy and still the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization is worth 12 to 16,000 roubles.
But a false registration can be made fast and for only 1,500.
The Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, and that's why there's a case of extortion.
"Paid a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," he shared with the journalists a national of Tajikistan, Umed Hushadamov.
"Give it up, don't be stingy, buy it."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that it was not just migrant registration documents that were false.
A number of “lip” certificates for language tests have already been withdrawn by the FMS.
Forged paper is printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get it for nothing: each of the migrants who had hoped to make it easier to pass the tests paid 7,000 roubles for the document.
This is more than double the cost of a formal test procedure: it will cost a migrant worker three thousand.
The main challenge for the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the “crumbs” cannot be simply bought, and both the authorities and human rights defenders come together.
For the time being, the authorities can promise to the hostbytes, who have failed to pass the test on the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know the Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active association with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not trade in the illegal arms market
The percentage of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law on the ownership of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: to force shots at the weddings when no casualties occurred, and the massacre by Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police officers want to ban the carrying of injuries in public places and to raise the age from which a license for weapons can be obtained, from 18 to 21.
Irina Yarovaya, head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, supported the idea and promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be made to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "rolling the haze."
There was an open letter on the web, which, from various public small-scale organizations, called for a “unnegative hardening” to be lifted.
The percentage of hooliganism with a registered weapon is minimal, according to the Russian BBC, the criminal jurist Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012, there had been 142 offences with firearms registered with the internal affairs agencies, while in the same period there had been 1,168,000 cases.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of the law on civilian weapons does not place the offender on the black market.
Now, they say, any weapons can be found in Moscow at a low cost.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to be in control of the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Vendors: from factories to officers
The Black Arms Market is being expanded through a number of channels.
The main channels are five, says a retired colonel, Victor Baranets, who worked for 10 years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a site that accepts arms orders
The first is an "armey or military trail," a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The guns dragged Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranets.
The next kind of black gun is stolen by criminals from the security forces.
The Barane explains that this includes both those taken from the police depots and those stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal "states" are on the market from the military warehouses.
There have been frequent explosions in many military warehouses.
"There is a proven theory that part of the arson was made on purpose - to cover the gap," the ex-military said.
According to Baranz, arms manufacturers are contributing.
“Private weapons factories are now in the process of breeding, which do not stand up to competition in the international market, and are hurling weapons from the floor to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
There are particularly many guns and machine guns coming from poor countries, such as Kirgistan.
"There is production, sometimes handicrafts, and the mafia that set up the stream," explains the former military.
Where did the gun come from?
The experts estimated the estimated share of each source of illicit arms transfers to the black market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Design.
The experts analysed the records of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and the public data of the portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, written by researchers, come from the army and the security agencies.
Half of the black market's weapons have been found there “in the hands of officials whose work is related to the weapons”, the report states.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the cases of weapons come from the scene of armed conflict, 14 per cent of the cases involve theft at the stage of weapons production, and 5 per cent are in “black archaeology”.
The salesman of one of the weapons stores, who asked me not to name his name, claims that the weapons found by the black diggers have been out of business for a long time, too old.
Most of the time, he says, the sellers are going to the military warehouse for a new batch.
By means of a flagger, a person buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
He's being discharged, passed over the fence.
"He transports it to the city and here he sells 900 Euros a grand with two shops," he says.
“Truly, the police are aware of all the cases, so occasionally when a plan to solve crimes is on fire, they make control purchases from illegal arms dealers,” the consultant adds.
"As in a luxurious store."
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking at websites, blogs, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the Bogoway platform, where there's gonna be a man who's gonna take me to the corner, where we're gonna trade.
The price of the gun was only there.
Military observer Victor Baranets
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, says a consultant salesman.
There are sellers in the market, but there's also a need to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell her that the daughter had a tooth."
I'm getting a couple of castes right now through a man I'm sure of.
He only delivers them to me, too, because he knows I won't turn him in.
Newcomers look for guns in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid 1990s when he was writing an article about it.
The pattern, he said, had not changed.
He was given an album with a picture of "whatever."
"I felt like I was in a fancy store," the military remembers.
The buyer, according to Baranz, is not offered a cat in a bag - it's all good to try.
I, a potential client, don't just buy - we're going with a salesman to the woods, there's a target.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I find out that a gun hits well, we start to trade," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa store
Internet searchers are uploaded to Web sites and groups at Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons for "a variety of purposes."
You don't need any documents or personal meetings to do that.
"It's enough to have a certain sum of money," they write in a billboard on the website "Shop a gun or a machine gun."
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
Are they gonna sell to minors?
"No license, of course," asks the user Ivan (orphography retained).
"Couple of TT.Moscow" is a cunningly voicing the request for "Fedorencs."
The Federal Security Service is now displacing a huge network of front-sites that want to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish for food, and then they get coal in Siberia.
Military observer and former military Victor Baranets
I've heard of such schemes: the site is usually registered outside the limits of Russian law.
People take orders.
The purchaser pays through the ATM.
"In response, they send a picture and an instruction where the weapons are hidden," says Dmitri Kislov, a media secretary of the Public Organisation Right to Arms.
Victor Baranets claims that by leaving the application on the website, you can stay unarmed and go to jail.
The Federal Security Service is now displacing a huge network of front-sites that want to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
"People go like hungry fish for food, and then they get coal to Siberia," he claims.
100-dollar macara
In the purchase of illegal small arms, experts estimate that between $100 and $900 can be met.
According to Dmitri Kislov of Right to Arms, Makarov's gun can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from the warehouses of the long-term storage by the management of these medium-level warehouses.
In the official Stastics of the Department, compared to January and October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7 per cent to 22.9 thousand, while the number of reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
US fast food and supermarket workers strike
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers work at McDonald's.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protest against low wages in Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food networks, such as McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendice, and Kentucky Free Chicken.
As long as no one predicts whether this wave will turn into the ninth shaft, or whether it is meant to exhale at an early stage.
The shares support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages paid by regular Walmart and the fast-food system, the object of the protesters is to set up trade union organizations.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost untapped by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The stock started last week, after Thanksgiving, on so-called "Black Friday," when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, seizing millions of users and sometimes accompanied by a fight.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who employ 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picketed with trade unions and left-wing activists the business of a corporation whose product is based on people of modest and average wealth.
Walmart trades everything in the world, from diapers, hunting guns and car batteries to vacuums, eggs, and milk.
The average product in his shops is between 8% and 27% cheaper than in the major supermarkets.
So many low-paying Walmart workers only stay at work.
Accessibility and product mix made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods cheaply, partly because it pays its employees little.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the shortage of trucks or hand-held scanners.
The Black Friday sharers demanded an increase in the salary and complained that the cost of the company's health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
Typical Walmart employee, who gets $9.5 an hour, can't afford it, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost a corporation of $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1 per cent more than she spends on her salary right now.
If Walmart puts all the pay increases on the buyers' shoulders, each visit to the store will only cost them 46 cents more.
In a year, they'll spend some $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart's supporters relatively notice that the protest took place in only nine states and did not cause any harm to the corporation.
"Black Friday" continued at her shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of almost 100 million transactions were made by its cashiers on Black Friday.
In an interview with Huffington Post, Dan Fogelman claimed that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees had left the job, and that the protest was just a “one-time pyar stunt” of the union that organized it.
"Free cashier!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the target was not Walmart's department store (they don't get a favor in this progressive city, and so they're not here yet), but McDonalds and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of drinks, and after that, he won't even give you sick and pays you for an honest job!
Djumain Williams, Councilman of New York
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
In time, the food restaurants increase it, but not much, and on average, their regulars get $8.90 an hour in New York City.
No one earns less in this dear city.
How can you live in New York for that kind of money, I can't believe it.
The McDonalds used to run almost a quarter of the American teenagers who used to work on their counters after school while living with their parents.
Few have seen it as the main source of food, or have planned to stay there for a long time.
Right now, I'm constantly running into interviews with McDonald's employees, who are complaining that they should live on this salary and sometimes even feed the children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum has a comment, the author of which observes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you're going to feed them for.
The protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of the fast food system start paying at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the area of fast food.
The American Act prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing trade union activists with harassment and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is also difficult to reach a fast food union for objective reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary turnover of human resources.
Disagree
There were noisy protests this day and at a number of other low-cost Manhattan restaurants.
The event culminated in a midday rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where a number of local Democrat politicians, in particular councilman Djumain Williams, said, "McDonald's" says he's selling billions of drinks, and then he won't even give you sick and pays you for an honest job!"
Other prominent New York Democrats, such as Bill De Blacio, supported the protesters, who said that “we must stand by the fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!”
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American realm of fast food.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, and not all of them were fast-schoolers, with tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not clear whether this spark will produce a flame of mass movement.
"As long as the brain is deceptive, it's medium."
The popular theme of modern technology has recently been the subject of the updated reality, mainly through the lens of special points.
The current model was first shown by Google at its annual conference in the summer, and later in November it became clear that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
However, the conversation with the head of the Interactive 3D-Technology Group at the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratories, Sharam Izadi, shows that for the company's scientists, the scores are over.
They are enticed by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, in general terms, what is your research team doing?
- We're interacting with machines, but we're trying to spread the boundaries of that interaction.
As long as humanity is in mass, it's stuck with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes with a finger.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and anticipate a major change in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox device and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect today, because everyone's interested in sign control.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Even though Kinect has moved the interaction to a physical level, a lot is still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of the information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not very good yet.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional display systems based on a variety of technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It's definitely not a panacea, it's a private matter, because you don't always want to tell people about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone's in their own pockets.
For example, we had a project to manage devices in public places where we thought about gestures, but not swollen ones, but so stingy, short.
It was not the camera of the device, but the handcuffed armband, which fixed the movement of the bones and muscles.
So far it's big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a handcuffed watch.
But in general, the future is a mixed type of control, like a sign-and-voice.
- What's that?
- Like, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what a machine can or can't at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a rapprochement.
I think we're going to have to work on the development of new sensors in the near future that will allow for a more accurate definition of human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it's very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your concerns about modern cameras?
Missing permission, depth or something?
- In principle, this generation is something that can be repelled in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it's good to get mega-pixels 8 at a rate of 1000 k/s.
But it's not the megapixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
From the last point of view, all the current technology is not good enough for us to add work to algorithm designers.
So you have to remember not only the X-and-Y resolution, but also the Z resolution.
It's also very important to have the speed, the number of frames per second.
Man's movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are quite small, especially for gestures.
Steven Betishes from our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with a controlled processing delay of between 1 and 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100).
Not everyone knows how it affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I'd really use the equivalent of this device in my work, but I don't need to touch it so that it's more frames per second.
- Don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is the receiver of the reflective signal.
And this is the third camera, which is actually the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A potentially larger number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the amount of calculations required.
It would be a good idea to create a flexible analogy of Kinect, to play with the curves of the cameras, and to see how that would help in the three-dimensional definition of the position.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present her points to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the day-to-day use of the augmented reality technology, the glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it's not very convenient to keep a smartphone up in your hands all the time, but I think the coolest option would be a "transient" supplemented reality, when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display, and so on.
Brilliants are a very personal device, in which their power (the private things you only see) and, at the same time, the weakness - the added reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's just say for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of such an idea: there is no tactful renunciation!
My hands don't feel anything!
What are your team's answers to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh most important breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the additive of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a substrate for the image.
She's got a good record of the hits!
But there are also technologies that are really geared to making these "carts in the air" tangible -- for example, the interference of a number of directed ultrasonic rays at a point where the finger is located, gives you a feeling, but as long as it's very weak -- as if you've been tipped off on your pillows.
There are bracelets on the wrists that affect nerve endings in the fingers, too.
- Did you try to trick the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he's supposed to feel at the moment he sees something?
- Well, that's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is another challenge that we have to face for a long time - how to make a man, physically in a very limited space, believe that he's going on open, almost endless - work on the concept of running tracks (not as in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balloons.
As long as the brain is medium, the work is still very long.
That's what makes the work on virtual reality so appealing to a researcher - a lot of things in a very infancy state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project “Petersburg Avantgarde”, which is dedicated to the citizens who are in the front, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top-list has already been hit by prominent artists in the art scenes of Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often being recognized in Europe, over and above Russia's popularity.
The new hero "Rosbalt" is an elegant artist, Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man, dressed in all red, who meets at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, and the fancy parties, and the vernishes.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always collect crowds of viewers, wherever they are.
Kirill Miller is one of the pure peterburg socio-philosophic fairy tales that create new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a bright man in the late '80s, in the early '90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance in the streets of a shining smile in the hands of the people of the city, arousing the mood.
He recently took over the charcoal and became a peterburg charlet because he was ripe for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy, and image.
- Kirill, why do you still walk around the city in all red, not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a designer with a view and an image.
In this world, red is a trade-off between an artist, an imagemaker, and a society.
Although, in society, everything that's a little bit gray is arousing aggression and arousing a bad character.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discuss.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevski DC, where my work was exhibited.
I realized it was my way.
Then a wave of free, informal artists passed, and new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I began to be friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-hazone that led to the Pushkin 10, and there was no more wave.
I get thrown into the theater, my clothes, my music, all the genres, except a word.
- And all of this has united in your Art Clinic... - I needed to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995 I occupied the territory of the Pushkin 10, and there, until the renovation, was a music and art club, a bohemian club, a home of the Paterburg Boheme.
Many of them were born, the NOMs, the Tequila Jazz, and I remember the Snura being taken to the Van Gogh ear project.
The cord and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, they were in a tight thong, among them the fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was the lead of many of the programs before the Cali-Galiban era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and he got basic education and education from us.
Gallery "D37", the "Griboedov" club, is echoes from the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and the regulars left.
I'm the hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "The People of Our City."
In the "The Artist of the Year" nomination, I was named, and my climax was over.
In new times, it's not easy to work under the old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the last century.
It's easy to become popular in these years, but culture and popularity are split up, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is characteristic of the way you know it.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, they're very relevant and acute.
I'm going to have a program show, "Russ Clown Museum."
Clowns are an extra-time category.
I used to be a socialist, now being like that - it's painful and scary.
But the clowns are shattering, the tragedy is getting out.
I love the Grotesk, I have big ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian dressing in order.
Now they're meeting on their clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in the face.
And the deceit will be removed by dressing.
And we've just seen you as the city's charmer.
Who better than me to be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be tidy, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are disintegrated.
Back in the day, people fell into a pack, the Bohemian loved the one, the other.
Now everyone's crashed into the micro-community, and now it's hard for everyone to like.
I'm not a hundred-dollar paper for everyone to like.
Right now, we need to think who likes it.
Now, every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stasa Mikhaylov's coming for a few thousand!
- He's got dumps, and it's a sex and social field that works.
And on a cultural basis, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and eventually less management, money, everything will fade.
I've got fans, and the main thing is, don't fool them, don't mess up the money.
When I was a kid, I wrote a picture like that that one collector had it on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with a picture that's usually finished.
There's a lot of misconceptions right now.
They say culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, grew up in the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money to draw paintings.
I'm for this kind of culture.
- Kirill, what's Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a concept: an official from a culture.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
In the case of the right kings, the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they understood that the right experts should be held.
There's a good consultant in Moscow right now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're upside down, because we need higher experts who will properly appreciate these experts and give them a way.
Now the taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but they're different from the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you - St. Petersburg?
-Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there's a lot more culture in Moscow, there's land.
And it's hard to grow art on our rocks.
We need cultural ground, and we have more writers than readers right now, it's wrong.
There's a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thinness.
We need to make fashionable art, like it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with St. Petersburg Grant
Born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with grounders on board are on their way to search for a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is, how can we continue our generation in the face of weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I think it's a small choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," he says, is a senior researcher of the P.C. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAIS) by Vladimir Surdin.
But if the environment on Mars is more lifeable, the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live at a high altitude or in orbit of Venus... in space.
We've started to look at the issues of reproduction in space with flora.
Half a century ago, we experimented on plants.
Four generations of in-orbit peas were no different from their land varieties.
And then, in orbit, insects, tiny fruit-drosophile flyes.
In 1979, the quail eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops under weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal bird on the way out.
And here's the problem.
“The problem that this bird needs to find a stronghold, it needs to get on its feet and start moving,” explains the head of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
When the birds did not find their backs, they hurled in a random way.
And 10 hours later, the newborns had a complete instinct atrophy.
The birds didn't react to the light or the sound.
And the problem was, after four days, they just died.
"And twice we've hurled out the chicks, and then we've refused, because it's just impossible to work with them," notes the failure of the experiment with the birds in space, Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last biological "minicocheg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
But the biosatellite "Bion" will have only same-sex faces.
There was an experiment with rats who had already been sent to space with a foetus.
Basically, there was nothing supernatural out there.
"It was on the biosatellites, but again, it's a single experiment, and it's a kind of research to do," observes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the cosmic rats had a progeny.
But it's not possible to address the problem of breeding directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, when they lose the habit of living, simply cannot exercise their sexual instincts.
A man, unlike a beast, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is in a position to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, no such experiment is carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the greatest risk.
And the most precious thing that humans have is the female organism.
Our Cup has left, and no one on Earth can say whether it will continue after a flight to space.
Can she have a baby after this flight?
"Because no one answered this question," says the Vahtang Space Veteran.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight to space, Valentine Tereshkov's first female cosmonaut gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitsky, a second cosmonaut, was born in orbit twice and even in outer space.
But the risk remains.
We don't have enough, there are a lot of cosmonauts who have lost their lives after long flights, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valery Polakov.
And yet, humanity needs to find some new ways in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPU hydro lab is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in a zero-swimming environment, cosmonauts are training in outer space.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults, even if it's comfortable, but it's not an environment, then for infants, it's a natural element.
The small ithianders seem to confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the fact that the baby's been in Mom's eyefed liquid for about nine months, and it's easier for him to get used to the water.
In principle, it makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bathing, it takes only two weeks.
"It's very small to forget something," says the breast-trainer Marina Axenova.
In short, if the birth of a child is more natural, then for a woman, gravity, gravity.
Very quickly, in weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, the pelvis, the ability to push the foetus is waning.
All right, let's put that down by relying on birth stimulators.
We can, of course, go to the special cell to give birth, she'll push him out.
"And then what?" asks the untrivial questions of Valery Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of Earth attraction, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscular system.
It is not possible to wear a new baby in orbit as an adult in a special workout suit.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that you and I are going to do, by allowing a baby to be born in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring to Earth a disabled, completely disadapted person," the head of the IMBP RAN Bioethics Committee, Igor Pestove, foretells.
As long as the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while, it will be a reality when the Earthmen on their ships will travel to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
The Chief of the General Audit Office: Checking the quartz system failed because of the politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic had good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, was lagging behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview with Aktuáln.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we do not have,” he commented on the current situation of Cal.
Such conclusions provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.
As an example of bad practice, Peter's approach to the so-called quartz system is not timeless.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the PDP (Civil Democratic Party) would not disturb business by testing - is it outlawed or allowed?
“The law should be in any way established and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the institutions that are required to verify and enforce the obligations,” states Kala.
At a meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, which compared the law on public procurement between the two countries.
What exactly was the point?
This is a parallel test that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation affirms how public procurement should take place, followed by national legislation and then also by application in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even with an unfinished test, there are interesting differences - to put it simply, we may have "precise and correct" legislation, but in the application practice, we are in some respects devolved to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, but to focus on the application of the law itself.
And exactly how this project can help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this kind of joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
The economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) cost to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not a fact that we're gonna do it by lowering the order limit.
This system may be filled with "paper" so that those who want to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the constraint hadn't been lowered.
You're talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement law.
And how does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our HRW (Control and Audit Office) there, or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, there is a Bandesrechtnungshof, which is based on our principle, a panel that works in a slightly different way, but mostly both institutions work in a similar way.
In addition, the powers are to a certain extent similar, but as Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the federal level, in which their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Accounts Chambers.
As far as local law is concerned, is it easier than we do?
In fact, I don't want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it can't be said to be the best in all.
Is that because they're better at controlling?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it must be said that even model countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, right?
In the case of domestic law, how has the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affected your institution in any way?
Given that the legal effect of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been manifest in our verification work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, some delay must be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks -- we've started using our new tool, "Detecting the risk of inefficiencies," through which we ran almost 14,000 public contracts, and we've analyzed them, which, of course, will manifest itself because of the changes in the limits, the conditions of some types of tenders, etc.
Do you believe that the adoption of this law will benefit or put an extra strain on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be.
The problem that might arise is that the rules are “hardened” and cannot be observed.
In the operation of the previous rules, the controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. the regional operational programmes - the regional council) in that any failure to observe the law on public procurement is a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in that way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal error that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the DPP would not disturb business with the so-called swartz system.
"Swarts system" prohibited or authorized?
The law should be in any way established and, if it prohibits, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the bodies that are required to verify and enforce the obligations.
You can say, "We're gonna change this law and let it go," but you can't say we're gonna pretend that nothing's happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules, as and what should be formalized, and that is correct, which will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied in the right way, which, in my view, we do not have enough.
Roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowed.
Most of them pass, but some of them are more cautious.
Carlovar Region
There were passages this morning in the Carlovar side of the road, but some frozen and snowed.
The temperature fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but should warm a bit during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, but it is a small layer in the lowlands.
However, on the ridges of the Ore Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from the regional roadworkers, it was reported that there was a lower visibility due to the mist.
The R6 and first-class roads in the region are currently running unlimited.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be frost and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to Class II and Class III, including mountain tracks, pass.
However, some of their plots still contain the remains of frozen snow and snow.
We need to be particularly considerate on the roads on the hills.
Pardubitsk and Kralovegradetsk
The Czech Highway and Highway Authority, on its Internet pages, reports that some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are threatened by a holoid, while mountain roads and roads on the hills may be affected by snow.
District roadworkers warn drivers of a holold that can be formed particularly on the hills of the Pardubic region.
The holode may be near Lanchkroun, Usti nad Orlici, Pollici, Sweetavi or Viscoy Mito, especially on the second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located at Sweetavi, are treated with chemicals.
The snow is particularly on the roads of the Krkonosha and the Orlic Mountains.
The broken snow is located on roads on the hills in the districts of Richnov nad Knenovo and Trutnov.
In Eastern Czechs today, the variable clouds are not rainy.
Temperature usually ranges from minus 3 to plus 1 degrees Celsius, light wind.
Pilsensian Land
Roads in the Plzen region pass this morning, but places need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
It's cold in the morning, temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and later cooling in some places, it may be slippery.
Drivers may encounter a mist in the area, but the visibility will gradually improve.
Regional roadworkers provided information.
The D5 route is now almost unlimited, but the road manager recommends that we be careful between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and extinct surface.
In south Plzni and Takhov, the land may be frozen.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and in this case also a warning is in place in connection with the possibility of slippery plots.
Drivers should be careful, especially on low-use roads in the Shumawa area.
Olomousk Land
Drivers travelling on the highlands of the Olomouc region must now take account of the snowshare on the road.
It was left after the use of the chemicals in the Cervenogorsky Saddle and on the road in the direction of the Svevisky Krshij.
During the night, the snow caused the roadworkers to go out on the street, according to the traffic control, about three centimeters of snow fell in Schumperka.
In other parts of the road, there are generally no restrictions on passage.
"On the highlands of the Schumper, there is the rest of the snow.
Drivers heading towards Jesenica must bear in mind the presence of snowshake in the Cervenogorian Saddle,” said the Chean (Technical News Agency) today to the controller of the Sumperk Roads.
At night, their colleagues from Jesenica went to clear the roads, and they assured them that the roads on the hills after the chemicals had been treated had remained bare and wet.
In Olomouc, the roads are easy to pass, but in Sternberg, drivers must be alert to forest sites where humidity is still present.
Oestec, Liberec
This morning, roadworkers from North Bohemian report that there are a number of hard-to-pass places left.
According to the police database, in addition to a number of places with holold or snowed, the mountain road was closed off the Telnice section of the Clinic in the province of Ustez.
The temperature also stays negative in the lowlands, so there is still snow and ice on the roads, and the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Middle Mountain, are, on the other hand, not a problem, the roads are mostly dry.
Road traffic complications are not yet reported.
Roadworkers report the arrival of a holold in the outskirts of Steti.
According to meteorologists, the conditions for his formation at night were perfect: it was raining and melting the snow all day long, the sky was clear at night, and the frost began.
Disadvantages are reported on the main road and on track I/13 on the border between the Province of Ustez and the Province of Liberia.
The snow-circumcised branches of the trees affecting the road themselves forced them to close the road to the Telnica in the Book.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to generate positive energy
What do you think of the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we humans are getting so easily hit.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we keep joking about this and say that we are the only group in the world that can generate enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In fact, in December, you're going to give a completely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you please give more information about this to the readers?
This is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, the end of which was announced at 11:10 on December 21.
The day before this event, on December 20th, at 9 p.m., three concerts are running parallel in Prague, Brno, and Ostrava.
They will end, frankly, at a time when the Pacific Island of Kiribati, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than we have, will complete the May calendar.
Who thought of that idea?
Initially, it was my idea, and then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to generate enough positive energy and to prevent the end of the world, we also want to consider, together with the public, the state of this world we will one day pass to our children.
At the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items of footwear, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, which you can buy at www.e-tap.cz, and also support us.
The Tap Tap band, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world, called "The End of the World" .
Will a loved one of YouTube's listeners sing an anthem at these benefice concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if it all works out and the end of the world doesn't come.
It'll be sung by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be aired live on Czech TV at the same time.
The words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the video of Tomasz Ganak, who is also involved in the performance of Hindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also work with other people in Czech cultural life, as we do a lot of charities and concerts.
We try to actively involve them in these projects.
Turns out, a lot of people like to work with us, they're curious.
What's the profit from the concert against the end of the world?
In order to buy the equipment for the Free Education Centre STUDEO, we've been doing this for six years with the community of Tap at the Institute of Edlikki.
Teachers regularly attend school in the Yedlikki Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the project to build the Institute of Edlikki, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with the project.
There will be a number of bands and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We've been trying to draw up a program that will interest all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, the Superport Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango, and Irzy Souhi will perform.
All details are available at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “grendiary events” in the future?
In May, for the first time, we will perform at the Prague Spring festival, and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we'd love to have a show at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the United States, would really like to make a presentation in Washington and Chicago.
You've had serious plans about the country, and you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London, and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their carriages have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and toolboxes.
However, as long as we've been able to deal with it, the Czech Airlines ČSA and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which has surprised me so many times.
Even in Moscow, from where we had just come back, it went smoothly.
By travelling abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes to persons with disabilities, etc.
What have you been up to?
Since Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we do, we have seen in Russia that in the east we are still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are a lot of barriers in Moscow, and it is still a wild place for a man to move himself in an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there's no such trivial stuff as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Happily, there are already social organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the other hand, should we always catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to make it clear that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own in the streets, to go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are taking an active part in public life, and that's what we're doing with The Tap Tap a little ahead of them!
Respect for the public or free will be one thing, but at the moment that we have some well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers, things will really start to change.
So far, it's a one-time thing - people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is now very popular, but we'll go back two years, which made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Yedlikki Institute as an educator, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself and I'm playing a saxophone, I've organized an interesting music club with a colleague.
Well, in time, as our host Ladia Angelovich says, it's a bit out of control (Laughter).
Has popularity come only in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It's true that it helped us to begin to join the famous singers and to work actively to promote the band.
We have come to the conclusion that a job that no one can appreciate is, in fact, as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment, etc.
Was it your goal to make the Tap Tap so good?
From the start, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
The show business is full of stuff imitating one another.
It's logical, all the new ones are taken with care, and it's going on for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But that pity is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned individuals we should be sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities are doing something, it's a shift not just for them, but for the whole community.
Has it been a success that you are a strict guide, as many think you are?
If we want to do a good job, we have to be uncompromising in a lot of things and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, attend pre-schools, and spend a lot of time on the road, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and do something.
He is currently a member of the band The Tap Tap.
How many were there in early 1998?
There's only one Ladya Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno at the Fléda Club and in Ostrava at the centre of Plinojem, with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are reunited by the TV at the time of the song by The Tap Tap "The End of the World" ("The End of the World").
The aim of the project is to raise 25 million kroner of funding for the purchase of multifunctional bare-equipment equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Institute of Edlikki in Prague.
A concert ticket is worth 400 kroner, a free entry ticket for children under 12 years of age, and you can buy tickets at Bohemiaticket in advance.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the Ministerial Meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland had begun close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and had actively participated in a number of Agency projects in the following years.
But Poland's way to space started a lot earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts had been travelling to space, but that was not always the case.
I recall, for example, a lecture by A. Sternfeld, who presented ideas at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933 from his pioneering work "Introduction to Space."
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, and after a few years Sternfeld remembered that it was only Dr. Jan Gadomsky who was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and André Luis Hirsch award for "Introduction to Space."
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and space science.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books on these sciences.
Gadomsky became a world space propaganda player, and his contribution was appreciated, including the fact that one of the craters on the back of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, Poland had built a rail-drive with a missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as did the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket was to be used to break the cart or to stop it.
Information about this is only available from the press of that era.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to think of rockets.
The study was carried out by the Arms Technology Section, in cooperation with professors Mojitski and Boulevard Wolfke.
The remaining material shows that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the coming of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the Specialized Press introduced the idea of a photovoltaic fighter rocket proposed by the engineer of Rogozinski, and the following year the work of the author's “air torpedo and bomb-aircraft missile” was launched by Lelivi-Kivoblotski.
Both projects have been developed for the military use of missile engines.
Prior to the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work, was involved in all military missile applications.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended as a result of the outbreak of the war.
The next space science work appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towerzystwo Astronomyczne).
For the first time, there is a mention of society in the November 1954 issue of the magazine “Problems”, which publishes four voluminous articles on space science.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich offered to organize a space society.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had been gaining momentum, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (PAA) has tried to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and it has become a valid member in the fall.
And the following year, the first president of the PAA, Kazimez Zarankewicz (1902-1959) became the vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 the PAA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful Meteorological Missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was the first Polish missile to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, which was able to cross a distance of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested on the Bledovsk Desert.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could have crossed 14.5 km, and its mission was to observe the high wind.
But in 1962, further development was halted.
The origin of the first RM-type rockets was a meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed to be two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (specified as meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which differ in size for scientific equipment.
Meteorological 1A had a space of 0.4 litre, Meteorological 1B 0.34 litre and Meteorological 1C 0.62l.
The maximum range for all three types of flight was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, a meteor-2 missile was being developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile, with a 380 kg start-up weight, was able to produce a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
==History==The versions of Meteorological-2N and Meteorological-3 were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Space Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, under the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashzewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The decree has given rise to a lively debate in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with one another.
This is linked to the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited private capital movement, together with unbridled financial speculation.
A significant difference in the cost of the labour force (wage) results in price stress.
By this concept, it is necessary to understand the state of a producer who, by delivering a cheap product, tries to resist economic competition by “defying” the value of a competitor in order to take up most of the market and thus increase his own income.
On a mass scale, this means for most businessmen either moving production abroad, low-cost purchases abroad, or disappearing; as a result, unemployment is rising in countries where the cost of the labour force is high in comparison with others.
As private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it has caused, the inevitable social spending of the State is on the rise.
In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of business masters to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the social economic and social damage they cause in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Uncertain methods of private capital create situations at the level of the economies of individual States where national Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their populations in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments are delegating their own people to arbitrariness in private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected above all in the changes to existing legislation.
The aim is to economically force their people to submit to the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic compulsion in the event of long-term unemployment, while at the same time serving as a means of curtailing the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, the poverty rate is increasing, while the gap between the poor and the rich is increasing.
For a number of years, the Federal Republic of Germany has had a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
As part of the improvement of the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constant cases in which employed people receive such a wage that the State must pay them to earn a minimum of living.
Such a scandal has become public in the case of the extra employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all of the southern EU States undoubtedly result in the same state of affairs in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic social decline are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on a low wage at the back of society in the hope that private investment capital will one day enter the country.
But the question is, where will it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because the Chinese, the Indian, the Brazilian, the Turks, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African, is still working for the European wage.
This applies to Latin America as a whole.
Liberal theories and the media claim to be nausea that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which is the result of an economic catastrophe.
Private capital persists in insisting that the State should not interfere with the economy.
The next question to answer is, is not private capital now practically managing politics and the whole State, for its own selfish purposes?
The clear answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of almost all-powerful and inclusive lobbying in all States.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation of corruption, of mutual benefit, in legislation that is almost everything that deserves to be punished, but is not a crime.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the Government ministries, due to a lack of financial resources, are delegating draft legislation to private law firms that are closely linked to industry.
These bills are later approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western Constitution states, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that a liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly facing the situation described by Appian in the work of the “Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompeius”: “The State has long been disintegrated, and agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribery, illegal receipt of favors with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any ban, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold voice. "...the good people didn't run for the position of ruler at all, in the end the state had once been left without a consul for eight months." ... "The only way to save this terrible situation is to say that self-government and the need to choose a strong man." ...Appian thought it would be Pompeius, but it was Caesar, who had finally replaced democracy with self-government.
As in ancient times, today's society predominates its own senseless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is no longer inherently intended for public use.
The present result is no different from the past: the unparalleled decline of the elite without any effort to make deeper reforms.
So the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes must be in the reckless liberalization of economic systems for the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the present elite has completely ignored the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a decision, or at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and the national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s share of the economy, enhance the role of citizens in the management of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: A lab of chaos.
"Nothing can come out of violence, and can never come out." Sting, the song "Stroke," where the main verse of refren is "we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons hadn't wanted war, they wouldn't have been" - the dying Gutel Schnapper, the wife of Meir Amchel Rothschild.
The recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated many reactions.
Some are in favour of Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, justifying the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on who, in this recurrent wave of murder, is a criminal, and who the victim, after all, of today's citizens of Israel, including self-governing territories, was born at the time of the current political situation, and who has not witnessed the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to see who is first and foremost under the 95-year-old strain (regarding the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is backed up by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of modern history.
The history of mankind is, above all, the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who was directing their actions to predetermined goals.
It must be assumed that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a number of individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have taken place in a single generation.
Among astronomically rich families is one that could be viewed as a head of fuss (I don't know if anyone's above them, but it's not ruled out) - the Rothschilds.
There's not much to write about.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they had bought in the 1990s to stop the rumours that linked their name to the high-level criminal activities in the shadows of which they had been, and which had always led to the strengthening of their power, the growth of wealth, or both.
They have large shares in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they have no share, they are waging or preparing a war (there were only seven countries before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were five countries after the invasion of Iraq, and there were only four countries left after the collapse of Gaddafi, but at the same time the Russian Government took over the central bank of its country).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the central bank status behind the Rothschild Bank of America, and in the civil war he began to release his own (ponima, government) money, and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to make his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963, and the MP Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for launching the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their yearning for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to a plan for three world wars, created by the Great Masson of the 33rd level, Albert Pike.
The purpose of the first war was to destroy the monarchic states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial rule, particularly the British, and the third was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion (the number of slaves would be sufficient to provide comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much of the resources), to create a united universal religion (ecumenism can be no more than a precondition for such a project) and to complete the seizure of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, works is to challenge the crisis and to suggest solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, which was to prevent the recurrence of the crisis that they caused in 1907).
So, after they managed to launch the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir of the Austrian-Hungarian throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia, starting with the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended with a sudden, unjustified military and economic surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy the royal Russia), and as a result the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary, was shattered.
To ease the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians had created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany, which had created the precondition for radicalizing the poor masses, and then had to give the Germans a strong enough to accuse the guilty and to offer simple decisions by the Chief, to further create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and had indeed played the role of the fifth column, in the instigation of the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rotschilds provoked the foundation of a Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish State, preferably in the area of the historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created a precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first confrontations with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have taken place on both sides.
World War II erupted, it was hard to assess whether Hitler had broken out of the chains in which he was originally held by bankers, or what he had planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps had created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, as Germany was provoked by military reparations for the Second World War, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of war for the third.
If international bankers manage to untie it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will be the victims of fighting on the front line, now with the Arab or, in short, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant lab, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp division of people into Israel’s supporters and opponents).
Who is responsible for, and who is the victim of, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we do, international bankers are putting people to vote in elections with their own candidates only.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Netanyahu hawk, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker politician who is doing his best to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to turn into a world conflict, and, given Iran's control of the Ormuz Strait, which contains 20 per cent of the world's oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will adopt a new world order."
The new world order in their view is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every organism born at birth is implanted with a chip with which it becomes a creature under total control.
"And make all small and big, rich and poor, free and slave to have a mark on his right hand or forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
Here's the wisdom: everyone who has reason can figure out the number of the beast.
For it fits the human name, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist demon students took over the U.S. Embassy in Teheran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the demolished Shah Mohammed Reza Pechlevi, who had fled after the US revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, it did not expect a positive outcome - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it had the potential to undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
However, it was not in a position to secure the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Detainees were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations under the mediation of the Government of Algeria.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranism at home.
The defeat in Iran has greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with Ronald Reagan's election.
The film, directed by actor Ben Afflek, "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six employees managed to escape.
After difficult periods, they completed their journey to the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, was able to take them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover story that led them to travel on Canadian passports as members of the film crew who had been looking for a place in the country to shoot a science-fiction epic.
Combination of genres
The plan that Tony Mendez's "evacuation" expert invented required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend sound, specialized magazines had written about the film project, press conferences had been held, a fictional manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
Afflek's movie is a special combination of a few genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called movie-kinoopus, the story of a good idea, the scam - an example can be a series of films about Ocean's friends.
In the film, the mood is constantly changing - on the one hand, the documented scenes from Teheran (the titles show iconic historical images of events and how the same situations have been shown in the film - there is no big difference).
On the other hand, the lightened Hollywood passages cross with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the table, at the staircases of the institutions, by the phone...
Ben Afflek had a great success in re-starting his career.
From a mocking actor, he became a respected director, and his game was no longer the object of mockery.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length film, after the dark detective "Good-bye, baby, good-bye" (2007) and the thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film to be filmed in the hometown of the director, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place is one of the qualities that elevated the earlier films of the director over the Hollywood standard.
And Afflek shows it in the Argo, where Teheran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, when real events are rebuilt - the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy are impressed by their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseeableness that arise when the story suddenly changes.
Afflek and his colleagues have a similar effect in the scenes of imaginary (forged headquarters at the Teheran market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that narratives do not involve many exciting scenes of film.
He's pretty good at doing this little thing, sometimes he's thinking something - it's not all that elegant in there (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at the airport of Tehran, and the race to the runway looks pretty fancy).
Argo's shortcoming is the dispersion that is associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, as Hollywood co-workers, are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they're not the only ones in the movie.
Afflek's movie lacks a bit of drama, it's a movie that you can watch with a moderate interest, analyzing the play and the retro-stijl that's recreating the trillers of the '70s.
But it's hard to catch up.
This, however, is enough to remind us of one, still in a certain way of living history, as well as to show how the notions of all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services are overstated.
Inflating rules for balloons, bananas and the circus
The website www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual poll on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to declare a competition for the “most absurd decree or project from the EU's workshop”.
“We are prompted by the last event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” said the “right” organizer Patrick Nager.
Among the absurdities already nominated is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of premiums for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less likely to be at risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU's workshop can be put forward by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013,' said Nager.
EU disputing orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which, as a result, is harmful to nature, and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small number of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of a chicken cell, which has resulted in significant loss of eggs this year.
The actual ban on the use of the term “butter oil” or the exemption from the sale of classic light bulbs was also criticized.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The Pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or group of States (in this way the Czech Republic now, even under the threat of a branch, defends the claims of its banks).
The lobby's interests are as follows: for example, the European Union's top-quality bananas should have reached a length of 14 cm and had not dared to display an "anomal curvature."
At the same time, the European Commission was justified by the fact that it only harmonised existing disparate national rules that made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, had nevertheless relaxed the standards for fruit and vegetables, citing the fact that existing directives would lead to the waste of products.
Last year's EU regulation that sells balloons must be provided with a warning that children under eight years of age cannot inflate them without adult care.
The EU has approached American research according to which balloons in the game are the potential cause of death by asphyxiation.
This restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are prohibited from blowing into fairy tales.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is rather absurd: anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but should instead say “BURM” (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com Portal, in cooperation with the Laissez Faire, a liberal economist group, has proposed for voting, in addition to the above-mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the level of food stocks in the territory of a member State.
The EU has set the maximum level of food reserves that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the prescribed levels of canned mushrooms, for which it was facing a heavy fine.
The idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of granting subsidies for applications for subsidies was also of interest to the organizers of the questionnaire.
But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we do not have the sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation,” said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas, in the fall of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high crop of grain and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the State had full stocks that had to be removed.
For being far from the ports in the Czech Republic, the EU, according to Palas, had to pay us hundreds of millions of Euros.
As a result, the European Commission had approached the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grains from land-locked countries.
Subsidies for the grant have been offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United States of America (US-DEU), in particular, to apply for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Funny orders are the exception
While regulations in member States are easily subject to criticism, EU regulatory efforts, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the EU, are seen by many experts to be more deserving of recognition.
A major problem, according to experts, is the use of EU grants for projects that do not even have a hint of deepening European integration, but that member States have achieved in the budget discussion.
It is an emotion among the Czechs and that, as in other European Union countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians, have retained the name "Olomautsky Cheese," but the "Toumen rum" is a 19th-century tradition in our country, our producers had to be renamed "Toumezak."
Only can be called rum, not sugar beet, from cane distillates.
The official list of the EU's registered products, along with the world-famous “feta” and “horgonzola” cheeses, marzipane from the German Lubec or Parmian ham, has already been found, for example, in the Carlovars, the Gorgelic and the Treshebunian carp and the Ham.
The EU brand name can also be proud of the Pardubic carrot and the Gorge tubes.
People want me to guard the Republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura claims.
Mr. Senator, how does it come to a man's mind to run for president?
I don't think about being a senator or president myself.
If everything in the country had been running smoothly, I wouldn't have run.
But I can't watch the country crucify over the last 20 years, how thieves are fussing, how people get their taxes up, how old they are.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a way to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and an independent, non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You hit the Senate, but you soon went to the presidential castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I always said I'd fight for the presidential castle, depending on the result of the senatorial election.
I later specified that if I were to be elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not to be a position, a position is a tool by which I can exercise my views.
So I need the most influence and the greatest power.
But the problem is not only that we're a nation murmuring at our bar or at the TV, but that we're ready to squander anyone who tries to make a difference.
In addition, media that stigmatize a person and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irzy Paroubek.
Let's get to your looks.
The fight for the presidential castle you started with talking about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and about back-to-back property declarations worth more than 20 million.
To do so, the law must be changed.
You don't have that power as president, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I lobbied as a citizen to make the tours a free business, it made progress.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, they willfully take up obstacles, and it deters citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan man, I have a much greater potential to receive support from all the parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it without a party's clapping on the shelves, without looking back at the dogmats.
Do you think you're more right-handed or left-handed?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like I'm more of a left person.
It doesn't matter to me at all, a bit to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about someone on the right, it's about someone on the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good public decision on whether it is offered by the HRCM or the HDP, and I will also oppose a bad idea.
You're mad when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you make a business plan for the firm, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already in the world, or are spoken of by prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will have only slogans.
And with that, you won't last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to the people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another option.
Just persuading politicians, journalists, and the public, and trying to lure them to their side so that we can get what we want.
If I had been elected President, it would not have been a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would call upon the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they don't, they'll have to tell me why they don't want to.
If there is a strong person who speaks of abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was a matter of public pressure.
I'm telling you, I'm an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to stand up to my beliefs and views.
I'm just beginning in politics, and I'm gonna try to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying to move things forward on my own; if it doesn't work out, I'm gonna finish in six years and get back to the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm the one who won't do anything, so I beat a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchure, he refused for a lot of work.
I have also at least supported the leading investigative journalist Jan Lorentsov, who has exposed the fraud of light oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but I feel like I'm on the balance right now.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the polls, and most of those who chose to attend the establishment.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate in such a way that change will be difficult to implement.
Despite that, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections to mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to test the cleanness of the past of any potential supporter, and I don't have any money for it.
There's no money for the president's campaign, and my transparent account is only $20,000.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how is your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, an art collection of about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and a Skoda Superb for a million, and a few more millions in the account.
By the way, Aston-Martin showed up, because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving, gallantic with women, and at the same time was struggling against vileness and lawlessness.
You drive to Aston Martin, own property for 60 million, and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
It's not very persuasive.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to get into debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program is not that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my pocket.
The campaign costs will essentially cover my senatorial salary.
But I wouldn't live with that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you're going to be doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut it off?
But it doesn't depend on how much it pays.
As I have promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the manager of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a spareless man who will keep the Republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How many, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting monthly?
From the 200 to the 400 grand that I keep getting.
And if I had become president, I'd have finished my business.
You'll find a full interview in the Saturday issue of The Truth.
MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not just in the imagination - in the case of Spikeness and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos.
"I think this building looks fun, it looks futuristic, at last we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a nearby big business, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad, and e-books.
Now, no one is willing to go to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
The spakenisse, a small-sighted sleeping town near Rotterdam, has a unique record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this unfortunate situation, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to construct seven fictional bridges, which are represented on euro banknotes, in the form of painted miniatures of iron beton.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And that's when the city's dads realized that they had the only way to beat the stats: to build a library here!
Vini Maas, a master of bold column charts and author of witty, sometimes even cynical structures, took up the task with his normal complacency and appeared at the 2003 audition with five books under the mouse and a smile on his face.
And while the members of the jury glanced at and shrugged their shoulders, the insolent Maas folded out of his original gift a pyramid of size and finished his speech in defence of his project with the words, "Dear citizens!"
Here's my offer: "The Book Mountain" in Spikeness, so-called Bookenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain rose at a cost of 30 million euro.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office, and a number of surrounding housing and housing units for a total of 50 flats.
At the beginning of November, "The Book Mountain" was awarded the second award of the 2012 Best Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 National Dutch Wood Contest.
Thus, the faceless suburbs, which had never been able to offer anything but a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall whose white facades suggest a dairy plant, have become richer on one modern piece of architecture.
But most importantly, the first public cultural building in the history of this town has been established in Spikeniss.
A Long Way to a Book
First impression: book Eldorado under the cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the center of the mountain range, because real architects and readers would prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glassed on all sides - a light and easy to see, baked brick floors and elegant street lights make sense of the public urban square.
The urban environment is perfect.
The look is unwittingly looking for bench, dog, and football-playing boys and girls.
And there are books, books, books.
"Of course, the bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a big dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Vinie Maas.
We put the classical configuration of space on top of the head, and we pulled out the area to read from the inside out.
The inner area of the book mountain has been used skillfully: the centre has offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environment centre, and technical facilities.
The black bookshelves, which are used to trim walls, parapets, and staircases, are particularly enjoyable.
Their kind, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even skilled architects and architects are lost in guessing what the unknown material is.
"We've been trying to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trowborst, the project manager representing the community of Spikenesse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once at a single farm in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in the greenhouses and in the fields in the Netherlands, artificial fibrous material of millimetre thickness has been used to support the roots.
It's cheap and it saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, and can then be discarded.
For the library, this canvas, for the first time in this volume, was pressed in a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) is transformed into a dark, homogeneous, solid material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit of a sneaker.
There are 105 steps to the top.
One who crosses the path of nearly 500 meters will be rewarded in a literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and wood chips in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the correct humidity of the air on the literal mountain.
Costs of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of the environment," says Troubhorst.
Heating and cooling are used for the heat of the ground.
Even though the Book Mountain is under a glass cap, the sun does not come in for long on clear days.
Large wooden farms, located perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shadows and take on most of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided entirely by the automatic rolled curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above by the IT scepticist, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was here as well.
And also a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Buchenberg "the soul of the Spanisse, who was long short."
The reason is that a few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to donate a book from his own congregation.
These books were to take empty spaces on the shelves of the uncompleted library at that time, which had 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are up.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Vinnie Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, everyone is now in some way connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration.
So MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which in professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spikenesse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for building identity.
Sabo: "The Germans have a more important role to play."
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
In the view of Stephen Sabo, the US-Europe liaison expert, in doing so, Berlin is on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first indicated that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany must now be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the imposition of a no-flight zone.
In the end, NATO made this offer.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, moving from the policy that the US was, so to speak, to the very German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent common policy.
So the Germans are back between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to it.
I think they're only getting a sense of their role for now, but they're on the way to “more normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy like that of France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a national stand independent of the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, exports and links to certain regions, such as Russia, China, or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are very different from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore defend its interests.
Did those economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to offend the public and elite in the Arab countries.
Either way, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't give it too much meaning, it's not a complete one-sided connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Did Germany harm its relationship with the US by refraining from making important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe, and even in the US, there is a prevailing understanding of the German position.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as it was in the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
It is a signal that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, the US has made clear its support for the veto.
Is there a divergence of views between the US and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that Obama’s government, deep down, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in view of the local political situation, the Government, of course, cannot take that position openly.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all thrilled by Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close links with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the EU's most important partner on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans to have a single, uncontroversial European policy, but it is not.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and must instead act on the basis of their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its links with Israel.
It's always been a delicate subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it really take the lead?
Or is Germany still hard to lead?
Germany is not accustomed to it, it is still always uncomfortable, and, for obvious reasons, it is always hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany assumes an important role, a wide range of anti-German sentiments manifest themselves.
It's not easy for the Germans to deal with.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the US.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and views, which is not easy.
So, the US's influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, that's the way life is.
Stephen Sabo is the Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, D.C., an institution in which academics and political experts from Europe and North America are jointly studying the problems of the Transatlantic Community.
In addition, Sabo is a member of the German Marshall Foundation, in which he specializes in German politics, U.S. foreign policy, and trans-Atlantic links.
"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lawrence is also a brand.
But what is Armani Polo?
It's a very official name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from which it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names have sued.
But it is also not clear whether they will be able to claim their rights.
“Foreigners are getting more and more difficult to defend their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, specializing in trade rights violations in the Far East.
There's a new case like this on my desk every week.
It is enough for simulators to add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So Gucci produces Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises, such as the producer of Puma, are legally copied.
Pattlock opens a folder with records of the Department of Trademark Registration in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trade mark, an artificial name that also used the name of the fancy Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese are the world's champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights.
There are multi-storey stores in big cities that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However, Pattloha's cases are not the same, and on the instructions of his trustees, he opposes the fact that Chinese enterprises are officially entitled to use a name that is already being guarded elsewhere by the Department of Trademark Registration.
The Chinese call it "Ban Minpai," a stamp-passenger.
This word is associated with "Bank docuan."
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not accept guilt
"It harms business, it must be combated," Pattlock is convinced.
"The brand of commerce is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image suffers very badly."
The financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, particularly for expensive copied products.
According to CLSA, China is the third-largest and fastest-growing market for luxurious items, with a sales volume of 15 billion euro a year.
However, it is difficult to remove dubious records in the trademarks register, and it is expensive to do so.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattlock speaks of cases in which the court dismissed the actions, as after a long time the protested name became a “market reality”.
If the plaintiff is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarism because he has damaged his trade mark in China, says Pattloh.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous graphics cases.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal argument with the construction car manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired a firm of Putzmeister concrete-suckers.
So the Chinese still have the right to use a logo that looks like a Mercedes star.
The Volvo company Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that looked like BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
A fashion producer, Lacoste, lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had a famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities don't think they're guilty.
The CTMO Department of Trademarks in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to a shortage of staff and facilities.
But last year, there was a "return from an emergency in the working process to a normal."
For example, the number of unsolicited objections cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 cases had been closed, an increase of 75 per cent over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still pending with the agency.
Fighting It Is Costy
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year CTMO received over 1.4 million trademark protection applications, about a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China, for the tenth time in a row, has led the list of new registrations worldwide, reports the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, to a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, a total of 1.8 billion yuan was paid.
Simplifying this means that each registration is on average worth 1280 yuan or 160 euro.
Protesting it is worth a lot more, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the firm has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans succeeded in putting an end to the illegal production of counterfeit car parts.
However, the simulator established Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trade mark.
This was a personal omission, since the last names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Ventzler, president of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO Trademark Registration Authority rejected the Munichs' claim.
True, in both of the following instances, Freudenberg won, but the opposing side is still fighting.
We need to be alert.
The matter is currently before the Supreme Court.
Ventsler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and lauds the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive, and it takes us a lot of time, money, and nerve."
The internal costs are hardly accounting, and the firm's archive has had to look at even 100-year-old acts to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg inconclusively offered the opponent a “higher six-digit euro” for a settlement.
"It's clear from here how much it cost us," Ventzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
Specifically, if the simulators register unprotected trade marks there.
For example, a Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freedenberg for footwear and leather.
The concert had long ceased production in those areas, but it had been able to prevent registration.
"We need to be alert," says Ventsler.
Both he and counsel Pattloch recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks, but rather to “all that is worth protecting, to be registered also in China”, Ventzler says.
Otherwise, it can cost a lot more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the wrong side license fees for his own name, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise, we will be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Singing, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, Imbongi's choir is rehearsing, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans enjoy it.
A history of relationships that have traveled more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, it's flooding: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats, and men's boots pick up a tact on the floor and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly grow - alt, bass, tenor, and soprano - they come, enchant, and follow each other.
And Fate Hoff, a 29-year-old conductor, is about to jump out of his mattressed shoes when he's flexive and expressive.
Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Glee Club of Imbong is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years of age, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor, attended the rehearsal.
"Om "Obani" is a complex thing, and each voice of the choir has its own text, and also in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and some parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS programme estimates that there are some 34 million people living with HIV in the world.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Estgeni, Voices for Africa found chiefs in Germany.
Of them, 70 attend school that prepares for further education.
For 15 or 20 euro a month, you can take the lead.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongs in Zulu means a storyteller or an admirer.
They don't talk in this room fluently on the bow, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir learns songs in this foreign soft language, and occasionally even brings them back to where they first appeared: south Africa.
After all, there is a village of Estgeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir, at a distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of Swaziland.
Infected 40 per cent
There are about 2,000 people, some still in simple shacks of clay and straw, and many children.
More than 300 of them had lost their parents who had died of the HF virus.
In Estgen, the disease of Swaziland as a whole is reflected in a miniature: the highest rate of HIV infection, and the world's lowest life expectancy, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the extreme flesh of men, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost uncommon among the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland's population has a immunodeficiency virus, and death at the mid-fourth ten is not rare.
The Glee Club opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but earlier the participants in Imbogini had seen a large number of children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but also just all: food, clothing, education.
Without school, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
Initially, it was a private commitment by individual participants - for a few euro a year to send a child to school and to give him the opportunity to get hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded a group of Voices for Africa, which has since almost professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Estgeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs are syphilis, chlamydia, and tripper.
HIV, human papilloma virus, genetic herpes and hepatitis are common viral STIs.
Frontal paediatric and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main target groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mostly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that in at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer takes place as a result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidosis, gonorrhea, and human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly higher among young people than among other population groups.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also have a common human papilloma virus among our young people.
How does the incidence of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than the previous year.
What are the symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the field of genitals, complaints when urinating, excrement, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, and bubbles or seals.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contamination, but do not offer 100 per cent protection.
In fact, part of the causes of sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact and close physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend a regular survey, particularly in the case of frequent changes in sex partners.
In early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and remote effects avoided.
Chiefship, donations, and not least choir fees all over Germany, make it possible to collect something.
"All we've sent to Estgeni is about 200,000 Euros," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is run by Sodwa Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also cares that orphans are well - organized, such as one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call it in Zulu old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphaned children, given them a roof over their head, and care that their uniforms show up on time every day in class.
Those who have no family members go to Hanisila's home, a single woman who is paid by the association, as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, the group "Voices for Africa" organized a sewing school, built two henhouses, and, together with the U.S. Health Organization, organized a HIV test for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but a disease that is so evident throughout the country tends to be profoundly silent.
King with 14 wives
"Aids is absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's related to sexuality."
It's quite unusual for a country in which the King officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Misswati III, is known for his love for excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-sanctioned way of life is also responsible for the spread of the HC virus so quickly in past years.
But it's also lying on vagrant workers who spread the virus around the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're hardly used.
The other culture is flesh to flesh."
To support a little cultural exchange, the Ibmogoni choir travels to South Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, combat, confidence, and black self-consciousness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites, singing songs in black, not only a good mood and joy, but even in the past, caused tears in the eyes of hard border guards.
The trip also leads to Estgeni, where the singers visit the children in the school.
Although a small village is hard to find on the map, it is more than known in the Etsulveni Valley.
"Go to Estgeny, there's light," the people here say.
And after a 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when drowning singers return to the rehearsal at Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is on fire here too.
Messinger: NASA opens ice on Mercuria
The Messinger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Ice cover can be 20 meters thick.
NASA's space agency has proved that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is nearest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in a special magazine, Science.
The Messinger has found evidence that the ever-shadowed region of the planet is covered with ice.
It must be at least 30 centimeters thick, perhaps up to 20 meters thick.
Supposedly, the water comes from a comet, or possibly an asteroid, that ran into Mercurius.
No one links the opening of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the probe's scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature at Mercuria can be as high as 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help to explain how water and other building blocks of life have come to other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticedly, probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small window to endless.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who turns around the Sun after Neptune, Ceres, by the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006, is not a planet.
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a “family picture” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue dots are harder to identify in the star circle the pink “newborn” stars.
This planetary region, scientifically called W5, is discovered by the Spitter telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This overloading heat of a dying star photographed the NASA Spitter telescope.
A donut-like ring is made up of material that the star threw out in the process of dying.
In the giant trifide nebula, 5,400 light-years away from the Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
The NASA Spitter Telescope took this picture of the galactic hospital.
The planetary cluster of the Pleyad, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen with an unarmed eye at night.
Of course, with a telescope, colors are better.
Like the red eye winks at the observer the snail's nebula on this infrared picture.
It is located at a distance of 700 light-years in the constellation of the Aquarius.
A similarity to the Earth's continent has given this nebula the nickname "North America."
A combination of normal and infrared photography provides an express color transfer.
This new star in all beauty was able to take a picture only with the infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: how they developed is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It's probably the shards of the moon of Saturn, which disappeared four and a half billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most clear images of the Hubble Telescope: the Waterway Galaxy
Depending on the color transfer, images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
A picture published by the European South observatory shows the thousands of light-years remote trifide nebula in the constellation Streltz.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trividus (tribal, trividus), since the dark dust strips divide the hot heart of the cradle of the stars into three parts.
In the constellation of the Serpent, astronomers photographed the foreboding of a space collision: 400 million light-years away from the Earth, the nucleus of the two merging galaxies is running towards each other and will inevitably run into one another.
This is the origin of the Hubble telescope star filmed in the spiral galaxy of M83.
A person who doesn't like technical abbreviations can call it the South Cement wheel.
A picture of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The mist, which is 1,400 light-years distant, consists of dust particles of 10 to 100 times smaller sizes than the normal home dust.
This image was made of optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away from the Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, photographed the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The Great Spiral Galaxy is called the UGC 1810.
In this celebrity nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The Star Cradle is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, linked to the Rosette Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars at a distance of 5,000 light-years from the Earth.
There's no dust in this glowing galaxy with a small black hole, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred just before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly water.
Our View of the Universe: Critical Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersey, even before Galileo Galilei began to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become more and more, and the spaces available to them have become deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar observatory in San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope is installed.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
"Grand Telescopio Canarias" has a gigantic inner device, the diameter of a mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The "Great South African Telescope" mirror in South Africa is segmented to lower the cost.
However, it is about 11 meters in diameter.
A lack of inexpensive design: the telescope is tightly fastened at a vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His specialty: high luminance.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
By means of a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Project "Seti Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing his or her computer power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
There's a "Very Big Telescope" right here, totally in line with its name.
His four mirrors make it possible to light the visual tube even the mean infrared spectrum.
A European “Very Large Telescope” is also planned to be installed at the Chilean ESO observatory.
His main mirror is to spread up to 42 meters, and it will be made up of almost 1,000 mirrors.
Photographs, however, should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mount Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors of 10 meters in diameter.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which is also staring at the sky by means of Subaru and IRTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a 30-metre diameter mirror, should appear on Mauna Kea.
Here you can admire the illustrations.
However, the most important species in space supply the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has produced images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, particularly those where life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 planets had been identified since the start of the mission.
Photographs of the latest designs of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be sent to space until 2018 on board the Ariane 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice on the south Pole of Mercuria.
However, there is no reliable evidence of this, as the Messinger is moving closer to the North Pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have shown that there is ice on Mercuria.
Thanks to the Messinger probe launched in 2004, the first one that revolves around Mercurius, scientists are now convinced of that.
Drink butter every day - and live till the age of 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a librarian age.
There's even a Longevity Museum here.
A search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a librarian age.
There's even a Longevity Museum here.
A search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
A trip across the Talich Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
A booming minibus rolls on a swollen road past densely forested hills, stormy streams, and simple farmhouses.
Everything's so green and bright, you might think you're in Schwartzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers from here.
This is one of the peoples of the Kaukasus, which is not much known, except that they speak well Farsi and Azeri and have longevity.
The final point is Lerick.
The small town is staring at the too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which is not at all in harmony with the painted mountain landscape.
Travelers from Europe are barely coming here, and the road from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, is too tiring.
It takes eight hours 323 kilometers, since the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, to the province, has not yet arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulayev (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in.
"In May, Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Festival -- and next year we're gonna have the world's oldest people festival," says Fatulaeva.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
There's a biography of about eight dozen pellets out of these places, over 100 years old, and Fatulaeva points to a black-and-white picture.
This is my grandpa, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But the controversial star of the museum is the Shirali Muslumov Chaban, who is allegedly 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest man whose age is documented is 122 years old, the age of Muslumov is extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, he died in 1973," Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he had a daughter.
So did the Chaban Muslums add a couple of decades to their age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher of age at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of longevity in Central Asia.
"A remarkable number of older people can also be found in some parts of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Sholtz says, "in Sardinia, too, there are very many very old people."
However, due to the lack of documentation, it is not possible to scientifically confirm the age, as there were no civil status registers.
Every day a glass of hot butter
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the area of Lerik are astonishingly often reaching the age of the Bible.
It is home to 20 people over the age of 100.
Why are there so many long livers here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide, Farid Mugimzade, explains this by the special genes of the waist.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes it's about food.
Chickens like meat, bread, and the most dairy foods, many of them drink a glass of hot oil every day, but it's hardly a high-calorie diet that can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
In Chengemiran, a small village near the town of Lerik, Rubba Mirzoeva lives.
At the age of 97, she was still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter that's not getting tired of driving back and forth.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one son and daughter of Mirzaeva, who have long had grandchildren.
There's also two kids riding in the area.
In the kitchen, the guests make tea that is served in the typical bubble cups of the armood.
Mirzaeva has perfect flat and strong white teeth, under her headscarf, she hides the long, dark-rowed braces that her son proudly opens up in front of us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I never used shampoo," said Mirzaeva.
A monthly pension is sufficient for a living
She always ate what grew up in her own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought any groceries in my life.
She then talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But it was better when the "love father" Haydar Aliyev got in control.
Propaganda is not often spoken in an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan has virtually no borders.
He was in power until 2003, and his son Ilham took over.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elders.
230 manats (about the same amount as the euro) Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions it is a sum that can live well.
And perhaps the long-growing son of Mirzaeva is also right: "Old people in our culture have deep respect."
They live in a big family, loved, cared for, and happy.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human right” is not in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo reflect a deep division of the country.
The future constitution, based on the sharia, had met with a fierce rebuttal.
The Egyptian president didn't sting for the pafos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success rests on my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on State TV.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to Christian Cops, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and non-religious Egyptians.
Indeed, all of them, still hopelessly divided in the disunified opposition, are fearful.
Fear of the religious state on the Nile on the mercy of the mighty Muslim Brothers.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said that he had temporarily shortened the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competence “to save the revolution”.
But what really wants to save a 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. at the U.S. University of South California is not clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be powerless?
In fact, 234 articles have been dragged in a night-long 15-hour race with obstacles to an Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is in part a source of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judicial process is based on the “principles of Islamic law”.
But what do you mean, "principles"?
This was and continues to be a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use the vague language and the resulting legal luff to better interpret the sharia.
At least one new article suggests this: in all sharia cases, the Al-Ashar University Council, the country ' s most important Islamist institution, enjoys a high profile in all Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy is in charge of the law, which would de facto result in the restriction of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, a lot is being interpreted
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to a military court must be preserved.
These courts, during Mubarak's time, served to suppress the opponents.
Up to 11,000 civilians had been held in military detention since the dictator had been demolished.
Also, as the draft states, the State must protect the “true nature of the Egyptian family” and “provide its morals and values”.
This is so vague in legal terms that public institutions will be able to control even the content of films and literature by means of this article.
It means nothing but censoring.
In general, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
The other, however, forbids insulting and slandering the prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished is not clear.
It was also questionable to say that “intimidation of people” was prohibited.
Will cartoons of the president or jokes about law school be enough?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this draft, which Mursi is proposing for signature and which he said “very soon” would be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back."
For weeks now, opposition to Islamist supremacy has been under way.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who held the third position in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former head of the international atomic power agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution had a place “in the dump of history”.
Through a short Twitter news service, he accused Morsi's adherents of wanting to lead a "putch against democracy."
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and cast it down," said the opposition, Yasser Said.
"We're not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy of Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would have made it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for a counter-demonstration, but not at Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile to the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under the veils and Salafites, who cried out, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi "clean the country" and said, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which it began has led to a state of almost civil war.
The followers of Morsi evidently did not want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loudly and clearly.
Now it is time to let the people decide in the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
Most for the Islamist project, it's considered a done deal.
"The concept of "human right" is never mentioned."
Hafiz Abu Sayeda is furious about this fortified constitutional process, which, in fact, was to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EPRO) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison in Mubarak or being tried.
Not because he shared their world view, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this, he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the word "human rights" is never found in the new constitution, and he regrets talking to "Welt am Sonntag."
The increased influence of Mursi on all three branches of government in the State disappoints the lawyer.
These measures are clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“In addition to strengthening a civilian state, the President de facto annulled it,” Saeda regrets.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Sayeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which is looking at the ideological struggle of the tracks on the Nile with a mix of curiosity and tension.
That could be the payoff.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster that you cannot control."
Norwegian Racfisk: The worst-smelling fish in the world?
The 5 million people in Norway have one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Perhaps the secret of this country's success is somehow linked to the local addiction to one extremely stinky fish dish?
Take a couple of overfrequent pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sporting clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're going to have the smell of the racfisk, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but there's an indestructible smell in the air.
Racfisk is a trout that's stained with salt and wandered in the water for a year, depending on what kind of sweetness is to be achieved.
As the twilight converges and it's cold, a crowd of Norwegians are going to a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, let's say, thrilling dish.
"She's eating raw and drinking a drink of aquevite, a local tmidden wodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter, who runs the festival in his profession and part-time "Rackfish General."
All around us, people eat fish cut with small cubes and drink a lot of liquor.
"Someone likes aquavit rather than a raqfic," Howard says.
This drink can break the smell.
I'm trying a couple of bits.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not so bad, it's not much different from the sushi you've been carrying on the bus for a long time.
Racfisk is a Norwegian product from a very different time, a time of poverty, when, even before the fridges, fish were soaked in hermetically closed barrels of salt water in the fall.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish had already been well and timid, they had been extracted and used to depress the perception of alcohol.
Even in memory of the last generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians had been forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate mainly to the United States.
The population is now growing rapidly, with more than 13 per cent of the immigrant population being attracted to jobs, high wages and a well-developed social security system.
The people of Sweden (an old rival, not so long ago, and a much more affluent neighbor) come to work here.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an inexcusable, albeit somewhat sinister, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it's all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 (14 U.S. dollars).
Norway rarely appears in the world’s news, and most of the country’s inhabitants seem to be comfortable with it.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Bravik, a right-wing racist and extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is referred to as "the incident of July 22.
It is very hard for the Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens has been able to commit such atrocities and murder.
Today's well-being in Norway is based on the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, diverging trays with well-tested raffinise, a woman with long blond hair and astonishingly blue eyes, the embodiment of a Nortic well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it, a wise man.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks perfect English.
We don't like to show up, we're not bragging.
Norway is very careful with its oil, most of the oil and gas revenues being invested in a special fund set up for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all the money they had not had wasted, Norway carefully calculated all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in winter and go camping in the summer, it's good for happiness," Anna says.
"And there's a raqfic," she adds with a careless laugh.
I'm standing in line for some food in the snow. I'm done with the racfisk.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat -- it's definitely exotic, it's delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening, we have more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel hosts a special raqfic dinner, during which the best, or perhaps the most scenty, fish is identified by the visitors.
There's a live TV show that shows the host in a bow tie surrounded by dishes of raffinise.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what's your score for the best fish out there in your mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our score."
Everybody's laughing and clapping.
Someone falls off a chair, perhaps overtaking the aquavit.
Or maybe just inhaled with the smell of that fish.
President Henrique Peña Nieto of Mexico is facing a difficult start in his career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Henrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties that he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's people.
The traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly poor state.
This city is also overloaded in the best time, and steel fences have been erected since Monday, cutting a number of key roads to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the Parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Henrique Peña Nieto, will put on a presidential bond and take over the country.
He's got a hard task ahead of him.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderon, which was now in the process of putting in place its powers, but the country had become caught up in a war against drugs, which had already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government has declared to the people of Mexico its readiness to combat violence,” Mr. Peña Nieto earlier this week told US President Barack Obama in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto's political career as the governor of his home state of Mexico City was under way next to the US President.
In his home country, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital, views of the new leader were divided.
Direct person
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
The inhabitants pay tribute to the revitalization of tourism, to the development of resorts and to the development of infrastructure.
One of the new roads built by Mr. Peña Nieto can be accessed to the city, which is very different from the roads with oxen and pits that were previously in the area.
His name is on the modern sport center building and on an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We have the hope of real and serious change with him,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman from the Pianya Nieto Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so critical to our country, particularly in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years in office, the PRI party was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos Presidential Palace, the Party puts high hopes on Henrik Peña Nieto.
In addition, he denies the allegations of insubordination made by the opposition to the new president.
It is very direct and very committed to the realization of its vision for the future of the country.
He's an excellent statesman, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast with the moulded streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under motorways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in this mega-city.
Earlier this year, troops had been recruited to control drug-trafficking gangs in those areas; and violence against women was particularly acute.
A number of dozens of bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near a vast dump in the last two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during Mr. Peña Nieto's Governorate, a figure that is far more than that in the notoriously violent town of Ciudad Juárez, the name of which has become negative when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to the opponents of Mr. Peña Nieto, at best he had failed to deal with the problem of the murder of women during his term as Governor.
At worst, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete home, which looks like most of the houses in this cluttered area, Irenaea Buendia has difficulty holding her tears, showing me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Mariana, in 2010 she committed suicide.
However, her family believed that her partner had killed her.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before," she remembers.
There were signs that she had been beaten up, and the body had already been frozen.
Mariana's mother recounts this story, and the picture of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion, on which only one word is written: justice.
This is what they said the family was denied.
"The state's officials treated me like an old gossiper, dissatisfied with an intruder of tranquillity.
They want people to just believe everything they say and keep quiet.
But it's wrong, it can't be, especially when there's so much wrong and wrong,” she says.
After wearing a presidential bandage on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
Tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence in the past six years, and the new President has promised to make the problem a priority during his reign.
"I hope he'll be the same president as the governor," says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nessa fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of ill-treatment, claims the charge.
The prosecution is trying to disprove Bradley Manning's allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning's stay in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires that the case be closed on the ground that Manning's conditions of detention were brutal.
The U.S. Army is accused of abducting several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who had been accused of the largest leak of classified material in United States history, had not availed himself of many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said he had had to endure while in a military prison.
During cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Mid, Maryland, the Military Prosecutor, Major Ashden Fain, stated that the records of the weekly visits to Manning by the prison authorities in nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain any complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the defence motion to discontinue the Manning case, on the basis that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in themselves a sufficient penalty, was conducted the day after Manning stated that he had intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is charged with theft of several thousand secret documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was later published on the WikiLeaks web site.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During the Friday's hearing, Prosecutor Fain, along with Manning, reviewed the reports that had been completed following the visits to Manning by the Administration during his stay at Quantico prison, where he was held under strict conditions of detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When D.A. Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he considered the treatment of himself by the prison administration to be “excellent” and the general conditions of detention to be “very professionally organized”.
The reports reviewed do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was explicitly asked about the conditions of his detention, Phein argues.
Manning replied that he had expressed his oral concern about the problems and that the officials who had visited had discussed the problems with him and had stated that they would deal with them, but had not recorded them in writing.
"They recorded "no problems" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise the subject," Manning says.
The Military Judge, Colonel Denise Lindh, also asked Manning why he had not complained of ill-treatment in January 2011 during a meeting of a committee that had been considering suicidal intent, which he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that session he wanted to be removed from the “injury warning” regime and eased the conditions of detention.
The military authorities explained that the limited regime of detention, at a level lower than the surveillance regime for the prevention of suicide, had been put in place to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm okay with them to end the injury-prevention regime... so that my standard of living would improve, in my view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thought of suicide in Kuwait, and that he had lost consciousness once because of the heat.
He explained that it is very psychologically difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is handled and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world has succumbed to Camp Arifjan's base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was gonna die in that cage."
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day - all alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to keep only the mattress, the blanket, the slippers, a number of items of clothing, and the glasses.
He says he was trying to move, because sleep, or even just lie down during the daytime, was forbidden by the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly hit by a light coming out of the cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he was turning around in bed at night, he said he was waken up and forced to turn on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to the ill-treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge interrogated Manning about the statement he made during his statement on Thursday that, after he had been forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night, he had been forced to stand naked in front of the security guards and other prisoners for a morning check.
Manning stated that he had not been able to cover himself with a blanket at the time of the check.
In answer to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said that he had learned from the guard's order that he should drop a blanket to cover for, but admitted that no one had direct orders him to dump him.
On Thursday, Manning said that he had been forced to sleep naked last night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a pair of underpants or slippers to hurt himself, but he didn't do it.
That night, according to Manning's statement, his underwear, his slippers, and his glasses were taken out of his cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to endure during his detention and significantly shorten the sentence if Manning was found guilty by the military court, which was to start his trial early next year.
The defence stated that it was planning to invite Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes, while the other charges would be challenged as excessive.
The resumption of the hearing is scheduled this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of persons under the strictest possible regime.
Among the charges brought against Manning are abetting an adversary, illegal promotion of data on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national defence, and the theft of State property or documents.
If he is convicted of all counts of the indictment, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans had been forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunities to implement themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Reuben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are splitting up between two cultures.
During a recent visit to Mexico City, I went down the incoming corridor, approached the border control area and froze on the ground.
The signs pointed to two queues: one for Mexicanos, the other for Extranjeros.
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I was always called a Mexican.
It's just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
Later, I referred to the complex design of "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than my language, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and was in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered that story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico, Henrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The issues of immigration, drugs and trade that were common to the Presidents of those countries had been on the agenda.
President Peña Nieto was willing to talk about the recovery of the Mexican economy, which would make it possible for the Mexicans to stay in Mexico as well, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and to create a North American trade block like the EU.
In addition, President Peña Nieto had promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals had been made.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is a grave and old-fashioned matter.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and, at gunpoint, forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But the Mexicans have been thinking for centuries, not for minutes, and they see reminders of all of those events.
So it is only for any U.S. state actor to speak out a word of criticism against Mexico, the press, and the elite of Mexican society that there are complaints that Americans are infringing on the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with war.
The most complex, however, are Mexico’s relations with over 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States.
You want to talk about resentment?
That's enough.
There are victors and losers in Mexico, people who find themselves in this country, and those who do not.
In L.A., Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin are only for one reason: at some point in their family history, someone, a father or a grandfather, was unable to implement themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
Most of them were Mexicans of a certain type - dark, low-educated, poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
That's not what Mexico sees.
Today, our lives are the embodiment of the American dream, we have been in good schools and we have made good jobs, but we will not forget that even that dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider to be its own.
United States of America.
We also know that most members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class don't like us.
We say the same to them.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats, and they treat us as second-class people, as untrue Mexicans.
We do not speak well enough in Spanish, and our relations with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind the silk curtain right now, finding a full life in the US, but losing our spiritual bond.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States when she was a kid, and that reminds me that there is some friction between the real Mexicans and the Americans of Mexican origin, and that Mexicans are more aware of their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin are more offended.
She's a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances are of Mexican origin and do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigers del Norte, but we love Bruce Springsteen.
By getting the best of the two worlds, you're bound to lose your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I learned on my trip, as if our relationship was already not complicated enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish relations with the Diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican origin to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent her in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to fortify ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too much resentment in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, the spread of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country to be so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but take care of it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unable to forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin are still offended by the way their relatives have been treated most recently in Mexico.
Yeah.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas faction can provide a fragile foundation for further peace
Can there be lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
It is a common, pointless debate about who started the first time; a large number of buildings have become ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, the majority of whom were civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip landed in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel-Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the hopeless links between Israelis and Palestinians in their perpetual conflict, the Middle East has undergone a change.
This may not be the case, but the events of the “Arab Spring” have converged in a rebel storm with many well-established realities, and the Palestinians and the Israelis have not been able to stay away from the storm that shakes the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons for hope of overcoming this fatal impasse.
A War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation is not a cause for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire, which was signed on 21 November, is being implemented, the fighting this week has only reinforced the positions of the militants on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement, which had come to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will claim to have forced Israel to withdraw despite the losses they had suffered.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the faction have been destroyed and 1.7 million people have been blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled parts of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well conclude that time works for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements grows in the Arab world, Hamas is developing new powerful and rich friends.
The renaissance of the regional leader of Turkey, who was once the closest ally of Israel among the Muslim countries, has been supporting Hamas; her example has been followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic States in the Persian Gulf.
Hamas's ceremonial supporters claim the establishment of an Islamist half-month around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, which is ruled by the Hezbollah militant group, to Syria, where the increasingly pro-Islamic rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad's power, and further to Jordan, where the King's authorities threaten Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was strengthened under President Mohammed Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 30 years and had been overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay much attention to the support of Hamas.
By contrast, the Muslim brothers are an organization that is much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas can become a significant player whose voice will not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, the “hard” line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israel's Iron Dome missile system had justified the cost of its establishment and had successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
Israelis can sleep quietly, at least for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the US has remained steadfast; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the last round of violence.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly under the Government of Binyamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that some 30 Israelis had been killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since 2004, Israel had been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the wall that entered the West Bank of the Jordan, a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and to protect Jewish settlements, which continued to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the elections scheduled for 22 January, has joined with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of condoning the Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If they hand over all the authority in the West Bank, would they not start launching rockets from there towards Israel, as did their fellow people in the Gaza Strip?
It's best to keep them out of the wall and stifle any attempt to lift their heads.
Proponents of the hard line may win; however, their calculations may be rebutted in the Arab spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and in other countries are not very fond of Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Israel's defence budget is larger than all of its Arab neighbours combined.
The outbreak of war with the regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments to strengthen their economies.
The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Mursi, who worked with Barack Obama to work on a ceasefire is a good sign and can mark the beginning of a change.
Israel, to the same extent, must bear in mind the long-term consequences of its policies.
As the democratic changes in the Arab countries take place, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later in the occupied territories of Israel, like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
Repressions are already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension, the growth of the Arab population, is only exacerbating those problems.
The bloodthirsty operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to pay for the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need external impulse
There remains the only solution that is unrelentingly called for by sound representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States and Israel's concessions to territories in exchange for security.
The hope remains, not too strong in the short term, that a cease-fire will enable other countries to have a more effective impact on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which is long overdue in its decision to block the flow of arms to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has a more advantageous position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the boundaries of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the shared use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries must also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than the upcoming United Nations vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to show a reluctance to engage in the solution of the problem.
This is a catastrophic short-sighted position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The Unified Packing for Cigarette Act has entered into force in Australia.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and the images of disease-affected body parts are contrasted on depressing green boxes that are the same for all cigarette stamps.
Australia's first single-packing of cigarettes and tobacco has come into force in global practice, replacing logos and colored stamps with a box of depressing olives with depressing images of sick body parts and images of children whose health is affected by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the different images and inscriptions that warn of the harm of smoking, the only difference between packets that are mandatory from this Saturday is the name of the stamps, which are printed in the same small font.
These are the most stringent conditions in the world for the packaging of tobacco.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful fashion habit.
This decision was based on studies that showed that people who had not started smoking under 26 years of age had never become smokers in 99 out of 100 cases.
“It is evident that even at the youngest age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging,” explains the Minister of Health, Tanya Plybersek, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the world's lowest smoking rate, so that these changes will not have a significant impact on the profit of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
Members of the tobacco industry have strongly opposed the adoption of the Act.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will have serious consequences, different from the ones that their initiators thought it might have," Scott McIntyre, a British American Tobacco agent in Australia.
Forged producers from China and Indonesia will deliver far more of these products for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the other hand, new laws promote business growth.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd., claims that the demand for cigarettes and silicon casings concealing unpleasant images on the package has grown rapidly (practicably from zero) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris, and Japan Tobacco lost the case in Australia's High Court, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 items to the wholesalers and is waiting for a new shipment.
It's a good business for us.
In the view of experts, the popularity of social media among the target population is a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
Following the passage of a number of laws in Australia that have made illegal television advertising and support for sporting events, as well as bans on the display of cigarettes, the advertising of tobacco has moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government had banned local companies and websites from posting ads online, but it could not restrict foreign websites.
"If you're selling tobacco and you've only got this little loophole, the idea of moving your product on the Internet is very tempting," explains Becky Freeman, a student of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noted an increase in the number of brand reviews written on behalf of allegedly common users on social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.
The question is, is it really a private citizen who likes Marlboro's cigarettes so much that he's spared his energy and time and made a video, or is it the advertising company that's behind it?
British American Tobacco, Australia, states that the industry is now more engaged in adapting to the new rules than in advertising.
The tobacco industry had even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: those States had made claims under the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade had been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that trade relations between all those countries and Australia were very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plybersek, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory photographs of the dangers of smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in over 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering the possibility of tightening the law.
A large number of smokers in Australia do not follow the lead.
These images don't bother me.
I just don't mind.
"Just picking up a cigarette and hiding a packet in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on a pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, manager of the tobacco store, King of the Pack in central Sydney, claims that the same package has made it more difficult to place the goods on the shelves.
"Before I had an hour to unload the new batch, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we'd say, "what to do, okay, it's over, shut the store," he says, putting his hands up.
Missing in a world of e-networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical malfunctions and was replaced by another plane that we had been waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and it won't be much of a book, a magazine, an iPhone, or even a duty-free store.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and professionals in child development have been expressing themselves in favour of boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not so bad for us and for our children to miss.
It's got the brain distracted on interesting related subjects, which may help create.
And since in today's world we're all constantly in front of a screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we should go for boredom.
Yeah.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many, that boredom is an invention of relatively recent times, when people have more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary of Canada, author of the book Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii, Latin textbooks of boredom, dated from the first century, are found.
However, the question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying studies on the subject and asking the target group of 100, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came up with the following definition: boredom is when people “will but cannot do what pleases them”.
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn't do something that he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything in apathy.
The main thing in the boredom, he says, is "disruption of attention and the resulting deterioration of the mood and the feeling that time is moving slowly."
The description of boredom may seem very depressive.
However, Professor Eastwood claims that despite the possible link between these conditions, bored people see the causes of the problems in the world and the circumstances, while depressed people see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's just hard to focus on something.
In his study “Inactive mind: Defining boredom from the point of view”, published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment that had listened to the recording of a voice reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard the sound of a non-essential TV program in the next room, others heard the same sound on low volume, so they could barely be rectified, and the third group listened only to the recording of a voice without an extraneous sound track.
Those who had heard a low-volume TV said that they had been bored, more often -- they had difficulty in getting focused, but they didn't know the reason for it, and they attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an adjunct professor of neurology at the University of Gwelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, by looking at the flow of goods on the conveyor in the search for a marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed to continue that when people start swinging on a chair or drawing caracules on a piece of paper, they do it from boredom, but now we know that in fact, such actions just help not to relax physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not prohibited from jittering and spinning learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit down,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all get bored: by delaying the flight (as in my case), by listening to a monotone speech, by looking at an uninterested movie.
However, different people show different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “bottom of boredom” to measure such individual characteristics.
To determine an estimate on this scale, questions and assertions are used, such as, "Many of what I have to do is uniformly and monotonously" or "I'm too interested, so I don't have time for anything."
With the help of such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys miss more girls, - Stephen Odovic, professor of psychology at the University of Western Florida - especially with a variety of external irritants.
In general, however, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991 Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment, during which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day with a pager.
He obtained the following results: 32 per cent of the teenagers said that they were bored in school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored out of school.
Only 3 percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson points out that he has no information on what such data would be about boredom now, 21 years later.
He knows, however, that "youth is at a height of boredom," mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do with it.
Let's go back to my initial question: boredom is good?
Sometimes not, because in extremes, studies show that it can drive people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling, or the abuse of certain substances in an effort to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have been thinking about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Odovic, who has devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; this is boredom," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, this very brain does not always know what is best to do.
If you're bored and you direct that energy to a guitar game or a culinary experiment, you'll make yourself a better person.
But if you watch TV, you'll only get better for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So, if your kid misses and you give him an iPad, he'll stop bored, but he won't learn to deal with boredom on his own or in any other way manage his time and employment,” Professor Fenske says.
“And such self-regulatory skills are used in a wide range of situations,” he claims.
Your kid learns not only to be self-absorbed, he learns to be self-control at all.
I don't think boredom needs to be exalted in any way.
But it's not a bad thing to think of either.
Rather, we need to learn to feel comfortable, even in the absence of a continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it in a way that we need to get bored more often, but boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get off the clock and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to the constant overstimulation of the senses," he says, "and when there's silence, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
So far, it is not clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana will be applied in Colorado.
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football player and a college student in the south-east of Colorado state, is charged with a criminal offence that will soon be completely legal throughout the state: the storage of a small pot of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosko said that he and his friends had once been in Lamar in September and had been driving a car down the prairie near the border with Kansas when they had been stopped by the police.
After a policeman found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosko was summoned to court for possession of drugs and possession of drugs - minor offences, each of which was subject to a fine of $100 - and a court date had been set.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for weeks since the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, hundreds of small cases depend not so much on the law as on the place of the trial.
Charges for small-scale marijuana offences are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charging 21-year-olds for small doses, which will become legal as soon as the law enters into force in a couple of weeks.
In the more conservative districts of Colorado, however, the prosecutors have decided to deal with existing cases of marijuana and continue to hold the drug accountable.
At the same time, in some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous regions of the West, there is a vote to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from coming in.
"All this is developing so fast, I don't even know what to expect next," says Daniel J. Outs, the police chief in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Members of the State of Washington control agencies are also puzzled to scratch their heads.
They will have to establish rules for the licensing of the production, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which should be done by 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“In Colorado, a more orderly market, so it will serve as a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Board for the Regulation of the Production and Sale of Alcohol in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than make some suggestions and hope that it will work.
"We don't have a real precedent to focus on," he says.
The Washington State Bill, named I-502, will come into force on 6 December and will put the state in a state of uncertainty for a whole year when the state licensing system is not yet in place and the right to own marijuana is already in place.
And there are still complex technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to strike a balance between the state's regulation of “adequate access” to licensed marijuana, and the ban on trade in it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds, and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses in urban areas, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of the recently established research group, the “Centre for Legalization of Marijuana”.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police of Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail message to his subordinates that the City's Public Prosecutor's Office would no longer hold persons who had reached the age of 21 for a small amount of marijuana, and that the police would stop incriminating people of the violations “from now on”.
The Chief of Police, Oates, said that the police would monitor compliance in the city with the rules governing the activities of drug growers and prosecute illegal drug traffickers and distributors.
The Weld County Prosecutor in North Colorado, Ken Buck, presents a stricter approach to the issue.
After a vote on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to prosecute the possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage users to receive treatment.
At present, 119 persons are charged with the possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also charged with other violations.
“The duty of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission,” said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the Mesa village, where the voters rejected the proposal for the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the district, no longer prosecutes adults for possessing a small amount of drugs.
D.A. Pete Houtzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop the charges in the already open marijuana cases.
"I believe that to enforce the law until it changes - our direct responsibility," he says.
Despite the fact that 55 per cent of the people in the state of Colorado who voted supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the State and the legal system will not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of the people in different parts of the state has revealed ambiguities between the local authorities and the state's marijuana experiment.
“The district attorneys have a cultural barrier in this regard,” explains Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing convicted persons for possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of the Laws of Marijuana.
"They've been stalking people for so long that they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana like alcohol, are meant to be a country-wide pilot field to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Proponents of legalization and state officials are planning to expand the area of legalized trade, but at the same time they are anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal authorities, who are still planning to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give up on the matter.
Despite several high-profile arrests of drug dealers and patients who used marijuana on medical grounds, the federal government has in most cases allowed the sale of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, D.C., and 16 other states.
Agents of the Anti-Drug Bureau are unlikely to invade their homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores, which are authorized by the new law, Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for federal action.
Even before the presidential elections, some local governments had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops, which could not have been opened before a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position to give someone a license, and then it'll cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was alive from Oxford for being a conservator.
The harassment of university students for their views did not start today.
As long as I remember, I always dreamed of going to Oxford.
My father and older brother went to Oxford and described it as the world's best educational institution, a modern analogy to an ancient symposium that lays down the two pillars of civilization: freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the School of History of the University of Oxford University, in the late '80s, I packed up my briefcases and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it, and he cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink out of squirt cups.
Actually, it wasn't that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically molested and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to private school.
I was poisoned for one reason, and in this glorified cradle of enlightenment, it looked like a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the conservatives.
You ask me, why do you think about it now?
According to recent data, a new generation of students with a right-centric view is subject to the same kind of harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that accorded to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at the Christian College School Club in Cambridge claim that they are “often actively isolated, personally targeted and made to feel unwelcome” because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the College ' s Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was exacerbated by the recent BBC 2 documentary on student politics, "The Land of Wonders: Young, Smart, and Right", in which the conservatives were described as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film showed Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who drives the Rolls Road, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver stick.
At other universities, conservative students complain that they are made of them as “a scapegoat because of the increase in school fees”.
Luke Black, 20, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservatives Association, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that "in the university environment, there is an increasing shift towards left-hand views.
People who don't even know us think we're predetermined and violent children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in the history school of the Christie Corpus College, in which a request for enhanced protection was made, calls such an atmosphere “uncomfortable,” while Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, said that the attitude of the student club members towards the masters of the right-wing center.
"This is a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the normal life of the members of the club," she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just a minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a timid and shy 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford fevered from hate to a conservative party.
A year earlier, the university had by vote deprived former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary status due to a reduction in the budget for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of a freshman's week, when the students meet each other and the professors, I felt for the first time that I was in the lead.
I didn't know that the teachers had not only looked at the harassment of the conservator students but had also been very happy to participate in it.
Political issues - the mine strike, the privatization and the Government ' s opposition to the imposition of sanctions against the apartheid Government in South Africa - have penetrate the wooden walls of the audiences.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the 18th-century French text into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the professor, the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I stuttered.
Harry Pitt was a very gallant man with a face like a cake.
"The Tatchers don't teach French in principle, or do they just lack brains?" he asked.
The other students shyed.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take some fresh French classes in your spare time, unless you're very busy rotating in the community," Pitt froze.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I sat alone at lunch, and then someone clapped on my shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the English Language Department, who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservatives Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Everyone who is suspected of being sympathizers will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most of the first-year conservatives pretend to be laborers."
Later, in the local pub, I cowardly tried to hypocrite.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
Cleverness failed.
A first-year student at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up on him.
I was spoiled, filthy.
"How do conservatives have sex?
- They're kicking each other, aren't they?"
I felt like I must have felt like homosexuals before the criminal prosecution was abolished in the 1960s.
Will I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet my fellow men only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a laborer and to hide my true beliefs?
The coming three years began to look like hell full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservator, but also for being a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speechwriters.
He didn't show up in college.
He despised him for his provinciality, pettyness, and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took up a professorship at Bilent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to travel to Oxford from a parent home in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and unbiased metropolitan friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, all political views were adopted.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said complaining.
- There's no way to do that, not in a city of sleepy spikes...
Even my Communist friends have always been perfect."
His wet eyes are blurred.
"Don't make any hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop out of college."
I was tired of a permanent trip to London, and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a conservator, did not withstand the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
Next week at the seminar, when another professor of history seriously called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the shower, burning with shame, I confessed that "I was brainwashed by my parents," and I called them "old fools."
It was a short break.
The last nail on the lid of my career coffin in Oxford was meant to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for Rupert Murdock's publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my stalkers gave up.
When they left, I packed a briefcase and boarded the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a cricket and a rag.
But at the age of 18, no one should become the target of such anger and intimidation in a school.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford, who not only released the 14 Tori prime ministers, but is still hiding behind the unsuitable reputation of a university that values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentine prefers the elegantness of glory."
ABC is talking to Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica, and other prominent Italian designer clients this week.
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital to accept the Valentino Harwani exhibition.
The designer admitted this at the opening of "Valentino: the Sewing Master", a triumphal retrospective display that brings together more than 130 high-mode dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "or signor" Harvani, but it could not have been written without his illustrious clients.
Valentino always felt enchanted by a rare and distant world to know.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, personal letters and photographs of the most prominent aristocrats, from Princess Salima Agha Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Shantal, the Princess of Greece, and Margaret, the Princess of the United Kingdom, are abundant.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social uplift, from a humble tailor from Vogera in the north of Italy to the idol of the international elite.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
"They don't even clean up their cigarettes about your gorgeous rug, like some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an admirable host and hosts with generosity and elegantness.
"We all enjoyed coming to his chalet in Gstaad," explains Tissen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Angelly or Eugenia Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred the elegantness of glory.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza remembers a charismatic modeler.
One day we went to his house to have dinner, it was after a fashion show at the Spanish Square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Valentino's style was manifest in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her dress, in her food, in his music.
"Everyone of Valentino's guests made him feel important and loved," remembers the "top model" that started working with the modeler in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He's never out of fashion, because his sketches are real works of art," she finishes.
Family parade
Harvani's life is not a history of obsessiveness, but of love with complete reverence.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House Gallery was turned into a glamorous runway of 60 meters in length, which offers a change of roles: a visitor takes the place of the model and must defile by the podium, staring at "viewers" of dreams that glare with Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a suit that was used by Monica Vitti in "The Nights," or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to the emperor Fara Dib.
==History==The names of this model are Sybilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Tourn & Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, or Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abascal and Designer, 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unable to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest, and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Nati Abascal, one of the designers' muse.
"I prefer him to the others for his feminineness, for his great love for women, because he highlights our beauty," adds the former duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors that he's using: they have a lot of light in them, and they're coming up to his face.
The ratio is perfect.
The Princess and the fashion-legislator of Patricia delle Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she was dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed I'd have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, that time came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear it to the party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt and a hoodie, "shopping" in a stool and a cut with no strings.
"It was a dream that came true," said Rodrigo's widow, "Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is out of time," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York, and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from the modeler with "maximum care... because dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories accompanying him."
Fashion King
The grand finale of the exhibit at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-chantal Miller for her marriage to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the modeler calls her sewing) to make this outfit of ivory-coloured silk, incrusive pearls, twelve kinds of different laces, and a plume of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Susie Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, that dress is a milestone in the late 20th century, "return of clients from the upper world."
Overwhelmed by the "lifestyle" of the elite for many years, Valentino is now the best member of the elite.
The Grand Cross Cavalier (the sign of the highest rank in Italy), the Labour Cavalry, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Words, awarded by the Order of the Legion of Honour, Garavani gathered as much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
"Always my attention was drawn to his delicateness, his tranquillity, his timid and impeccable appearance, "remembers Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was at a dinner at the Orse Museum a month ago.
He sat at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was perfect, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess is saying...
The hardest profession in the world: miners from Kawah Ijena
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilos of sulfur to the top of the volcano on the steep rock trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living by sulfur mining in the volcano Kawah Ijen, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto goes down to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfurous gas coming up from the depths of the earth freezes in contact with the air.
He puts the huge pieces of sulfur up to 70 kg in two bamboo baskets, puts the baskets on his shoulders, and carries them up on a rocky road.
Up to the top of a volcano of 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters high, but it takes the tired porters more than 40 minutes to climb up with a turtle’s step, with difficulty in holding the balance, and by bypassing the road carefully so as not to slip or fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong move can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the rocks of Kawah Ijen a few years ago.
The miners from Kavah Ijen make 5 eurocents for each kilogram of sulphur that they produce.
Upstairs, they set up a road between the tourists who photographed them, as if they were circus monkeys and, when they were tired of the heavy baskets, marched three kilometers to the balance that the mining company had set up a little higher, at a height of 1,850 metres.
This is the PT Candy Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, best and best not to say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) of petrochemical production, since it is common in daily life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Because the norm is 70 kilos, we make about Rs. 46,000 (Euro3.8) for every walk," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily shifts.
He spends three hours on each of them, and at the end of the day he feels broken, but they allow him to save Rs. 138,000 (Euro1.5) by the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a miser for such an unhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
"The rent to miners is very high by local standards, where the collection of coffee is paid Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2) per day, and the average monthly earnings are Rs. 2 million (Euro167), " explains a porter who used to work as a rocker on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was Rs. 75,000 (Euro6.2) per day and the plot was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Buluwanga, a town near the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia is as devastating as the sera: "I married a girl from Bali, where there are Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto's got asthma, he's breathing hard, coughing all the time, and his eyes are tearing up because of the toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special points.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's gonna get his eyes up because of the toxic gases that emit the volcano.
It's the price he's got to pay to make his dream come true.
"I'll work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Life-punished, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter, or a hotel porter, but instead he performs the job of a mule.
In addition to the filthy wooden hut with the other porters, it stands up every day at 2:00 a.m., because the sulfur never stops running out at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
By challenging the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater, lighting his way with a small lamp connected to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
Some 400 porters carry baskets of gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano.
Despite the high profit margins, the mining company did not mechanize the production of sulphur to save the cost, nor did it provide any equipment to porters who worked on their own account and with such hardships.
In fact, they do not even receive part of Rs. 30,000 (€2.5) of the photography fee, which, along with an entry ticket of Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2), the guards of the reserve are charging tourists who come to take a picture of the volcano and its mule men.
“This work is for livestock, not for humans,” says Badrusin, a 42-year-old root porter, who spent three decades in Kawah Ijen since he left college.
He's able to raise to 110 kilos, and he's telling me he's going to take the job "as long as he can," because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
If I don't retire, I'll die here, because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so patient that no one complains of their severe diseases... more serious, evidently than their common problems with breath, artrosis, knee pains and ulcers on their shoulders, which have been deformed under the weight of the basket.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only raise 50 kilos in his 53 ’ s.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which the three trucks are transporting to a warehouse in Tamansari, traveling 18 kilometers on a narrow trail in the bush.
"I won't retire, I'll die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, opening a wide mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, the older one, aged 30, also works as a sulfur vector.
Time is running out, but poverty permeates one of the world's hardest things ever: what human mules do from Kawah Ijena.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and the cost of housing and education for the absence of children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my wife a patriot, do our civic duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these strings are part of the marketing of mint cakes, but this video, or perhaps because of it, became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs like "Let's put the bao in the oven" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made the video, BBH, is hoping that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a entertaining way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their "national duty."
This thing is just for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce our own kind, so we felt that this is the subject we should address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, for example, run a perfume with pheromones or set up a quick dating party (blitz-widgets).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, that's to make a rap?
1.2 children
Who does not take it so lightly is the Singapore Government.
It spends 1,300 dollars a year on politics to inspire citizens to have more children.
The State package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extensions of maternity leave and tax benefits.
But it's all very low-efficiencies.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and for its strict public control.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its National Population Office, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - known as the percentage of replacement - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Office of Family and Family Policy of the National Population Office, says that the reason for the “improved education” and “the wider range of career opportunities”.
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life's goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and family-building," she explains.
These changes in social norms have led to an increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriage and the birth of children, which has led to a decline in Singapore ' s birth rate.
In the meantime, immigration policies, which aim at a sharp increase in immigration to counter the decline in the population, are indignant among the local population.
Singapore has websites that are proliferating with little-close xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and refusing to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party had had the worst effect in elections since independence last year.
After the elections, an attempt was made to address the problem, through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility has a significant impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, medical and immigration spending, Singapore’s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making an effort not to build so many small dwellings.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development manual has moved to monitor the number of small apartments known as the “shoe box” that can be built in certain parts of the city.
This 46 square meters flat is very well sold.
Nevertheless, there is a view that they can promote a single life and discourage developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, the CEO of the EL Developers, says that their shoeboxes are sold much faster than more spacious copies.
They're more popular, in the sense that such apartments buy out for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our income is increasing.
However, he acknowledged that the new rules provided clearer guidance to the developers who had been placed in the process of obstructing them if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too overstretched
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards an increase in national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have much effect.
"People are very overstretched, housing is expensive, as is education, and because of that, a lot of people put it off," says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important to me to have my own money and time," another young man is 20 years old.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and prices of housing and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how the government tries to induce its citizens to have children, the last word is for the Singaporeans.
Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, this is a private or “sphere of private life, which has the right to protect from any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social media?
Does he understand the dangers of Internet discussions that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five guys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," in a private way, and "password and user's name" when they applied it to social media.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't have uploaded to the post," says Jorge, a ten-year-old, when he's trying to explain the meaning of personal on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"It's very secret, my mom may know them, but not the world," he claims.
On the FB, I download beautiful images or images of games.
I also have fun with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not mine, or someone who's being stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is not good to publish indecent photos of naked people, crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 of his FB friends and nine of his Twitter followers.
Most of them are related.
The mother knows she has a password for one of the records.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just downloading them," he adds.
"Social nets are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends fast," he says.
Unthinkingly, he says that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
Wouldn't count with someone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This young man has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know the 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one was trusting him or asking for his home address or phone number.
"If I get pressured or demanded, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is known today as cybermobing.
A friend of mine was being blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not delete the record.
"Only included privacy."
He then explains the sequence of steps to set up the account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have downloaded photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or conflicting situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I don't like a man or if I want to.
"Although I know it's cybermobing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marios Porras, an English professor and a specialist in education and training, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet has appeared as a means of searching for information, but with the advent of these websites, the rules of the game have changed," she notes.
Porras points out that the academist Mark Prensky, a teacher at Yale University, and the author of the work, Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented the terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital aboriginals are them, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning ourselves," she says.
Explains that the subject is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken at a age when maturity is not sufficient to do so”.
"Even so that they're selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends, not to think about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them reflect.
"Telling them not to do it is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to have a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others publish about you?
When you sign the party photos, do you ask permission from others to mark them?
And one thing is, does everyone need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to act online the way they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Over the Internet, man behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as well as social media," she claims.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a professor of primary education and a consultant for education, explains the need for heads of families to read in good faith social media policies.
By understanding each point, they have good reason to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is permitted to distribute or publish," he says.
According to Gourdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR summit ends without the declaration of Lima
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the declaration of the Lima Declaration, which was previously and in theory signed by the seven parties.
Efe had repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the President's Administration had indicated on the front page that it would be translated after the closure, but had later confirmed that it would be published on the website of the Government of Peru at a certain time.
On questions about the text, they indicated that the contents had been made available by the President of Peru, Oliant Umala, during brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the Summit was always limited.
In the course of the day, only a video of the president's assembly was broadcast in the Press Hall, with a message "closed session, no sound. "
A small amount of information that was circulating among reporters was transmitted by the UNASUR press secretaries present at the meeting, but not by Peru.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discontent among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who had asked for more information.
Subsequently, the President's administration sent an e-mail to the media with the final declaration of the summit, but this is the Umala statement, not the official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of the South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was also not distributed, despite press insistence.
On the official website of the ASPA, it is possible to check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had made efforts to ensure that all journalists were provided with transmission systems, but had limited access to information as much as possible.
The Summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt a verdict of the Hague Court, which settles the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinière, have met at a regional meeting and have ratified that they will abide by the ruling of the International Court of Justice, which begins the hearing of the statements of both parties on Monday in The Hague, in the context of the charge that Lima has put forward against Santiago.
“We will respect and implement a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court,” said Umala, next to her Chilean colleague.
“Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of differences, pacts, and international tribunals,” he added, and welcomed the hand of Umala in the context of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by the two Presidents that they were subject to the International Court of Justice took place right after Colombia protested this week against the Pact of Bogotá, under which it recognized the subjection to the verdicts of that international court following the decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be wrong.
The Summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR had been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former President, Fernando Lugo, had not participated in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Umala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and for closing the summit, just later in the afternoon in Lima.
The Head of State read the final document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and action lines had been approved for 31 projects among South American countries, with an estimated investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries would take “important steps towards the purpose of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residence agreements”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against public insecurity and organized transnational crime, action to increase access to drugs, low-cost Internet access in all parts of South America, and to take into account the combined and effective risk of natural disasters”.
As Europe is in crisis, “the economic unification (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our production base and forge a better future for our cities,” Oomala added.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve South American spaces, particularly in the countryside and border zones ... uniting our countries and creating new economic schemes," the Peruvian president said in a read.
Among the projects, he mentioned that five were Peru and were limited to transverse axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, while two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide any more details.
The outcome document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations, from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united and to have good relations among its neighbours, was another theme emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before he began to attend the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (saturday), perhaps meet President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
“We will review all of these paths, not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua, will require discussion with Nicaragua,” he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we can deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," he added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the new President of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also in the context of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Guyana, Suriname, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela form UNASUR, although the participation of the last country has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidentship in the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship”: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is the goal of “South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the VIth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, said to Peru's public television that the Europeans had “killed each other during the Second World War” and in other clashes, “but now they are almost the same country”.
In this context, it defended the South American citizenship project, which is endorsed by the UNASUR member countries.
“There must be free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want us back in the past,” he cautioned.
The President of Ecuador has also expressed his support for the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition of diminishing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Human Rights Pact.
The lecturers never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the other hand, sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington, D.C., and is financed by the United States,” he said, in hinding to the political asylum given to the founder of WikiLeaks by Ecuador to Julian Assange.
Correa assured us that he did not regret this decision, because with him he did not give up his principles but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that at the time “there had been some suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring him to come to his territory for questioning of the alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law itself considers it possible to implement it by means of a video conferencing that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London”.
Correa confirmed that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Head of State of Ecuador.
What is real is the risk of a deterioration in his physical and mental health due to his captivity in a small space without the ability to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a security guarantee that would enable him to go to Ecuador, was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there had been talks in London to find a solution to the problem of the WikiLeaks prisoner.
We do not negotiate human rights, a word we do not use in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, because assange's lawyer, Balthasar Garson, is running a number of trials in various European jurisdictions," he mentioned.
And he thought, "if the United Kingdom gives tomorrow a guarantee of immunity, it'll end."
And if Sweden, as well as it is perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Senor Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interviews him on Skype, the problem will be over tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to manifest himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate “mediocy, bad faith and lies that distorted freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of the freedom of the press are not corrupted bad politicians, but bad journalists who support gain, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that respect, he was pleased that neither these journalists, “no bankers nor bourgeois hegemonic countries are dominant in Ecuador”, and added that, by re-elected, “will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to keep the Paraguayan veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the mask of legitimacy” because, in fact, “it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy”.
The Ecuadorian President also considered the “full justification” for his Colombian colleague, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which had been in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
This decision is not being implemented to date.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the desire to go together.
It is necessary to process them together to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed the hope that the maritime boundary dispute that Peru and Chile are pursuing in the same court would be well concluded and said that “it is right for Latin America to resort to international bodies if the two countries commit themselves to a decision, however difficult it may be”.
With regard to the opportunity to stand as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he was considering the possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it was difficult”.
Correa assured me that if he lost in the elections in February 2013, he would be out of public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be remedied only by political power.
"My political movement considered that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so that we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"This is the decision," he confirmed.
Correa also referred to the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Venezuelan Vice-President, Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that had already been scheduled to be routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the health of President Chávez," he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Deaths from AIDS today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test had been positive.
"I feel like I've been deafened," he remembers, despite all the doctor's tact, the moment.
The boy hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified, and he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the “oldest” patients in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which was admitted in 1994, and has overcome a number of obstacles.
He's been living with the diagnosis of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s it would be hard to believe that there were too few treatments at that time, too little to know about the disease, and too biased about the sick.
So even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection didn't want to say good-bye to him "because he had a cut."
In other words, it was a sentence to have AIDS at that time.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and do it without compromising the quality of life.
Yet, without knowing of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, has “tortured” their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greatest achievement at the moment is that the patient's survival, who begins treatment in a timely manner, and the general population's survival is exactly the same,” pointed out the head of HCG HIV, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008 scientists have come to the conclusion that AIDS is not a sentence, but that the length and quality of life depends on the degree of injury to the immune system available to patients at the start of the diagnosis, with a better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with a number of 200 CD4s, and up to 50 years when 500 CD4s are reported.
Simply put, the above means that a person who is diagnosed as HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “supporting control will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age,” he explained.
In order to measure this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 per cent of the patients in the national database have died since the emergence of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people had died in 2011 and 187 had already been killed by May of that year; however, it was said that there had been universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatals?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I picture it, that's how things are in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we haven't had a shortage of drugs, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He gave devastating data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some sort of opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and so we need to provide samples for detection on a mass scale, for all people who ask for it."
In his proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA) as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a private lab to check it out only because his friend had done so and, despite his young age, he had already been in the AIDS stage and had even suffered from Caposhi's sarcoma, a cancer that was one of the common complications.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather get drunk three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There's a positive change, I'm good at eating, doing exercise, taking my meds.
To date, his parents only know that he's had cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with a shared responsibility, I care for myself and for another person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his private life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to inspire the people who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, in fear.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, so let them know if they already have a diagnosis, and let them know that they can live like any other person who is responsible.
His presentation summed up the theme of the fight against AIDS this year.
Condoms on the counter
Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken up the HIV problem, claims to be a huge gap between health programmes and a common citizen.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In the places on the subject, "in fact, the distribution of condoms has increased, we've been given one or two before, now we're getting a packet of 100, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are people who still don't have access to the condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you want them?" that's a popular question, with ecstasy and condemnation, by social workers, school counselors, pharmacists, and health-care professionals, who don't want to hear from the teenagers, the promoter assured.
I suggest that this inefficient distribution be changed; that condoms be not just behind the counters, and that hundreds of them be in machine-guns in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.
It's not promiscuity.
It was not about the payment of beer and motels, and Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied when he was asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his management.
"It's not sexy, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already practising sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
There are 13,435 recorded cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is ranked four in the national ratings for new and cumulative cases of AIDS and the 13th in HIV.
92% of the infections are sex, 6% through blood, and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know about it.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that annuls the restructuring of the Vitro Group ' s debt achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighbouring country that has problems with capacity to pay.
It seems that procedures to support the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican law are not valid in the country's lanes and stars, in contrast to international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the 15 June decision by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bankruptcy Court of the North Texas County leaves defenceless Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
The ruling, however, opens the doors of the leading glass producer in Mexico to the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the trial judge points out that creditors must be governed by the US Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings concern a competitive proceeding in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law had been established for that purpose, and the American Institute of Law had been designated an arbiter.
Second, the verdict states that, without an inter-firm vote, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved, recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt that the Vitro subsidiaries had owed to the parent company.
Nevertheless, Mexico's laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agramex and Comercial Mexico, whose inter-firm debts have been guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Industries.
It is also true that, by deducting the votes of the branches, the lenders of Vitro, who had fought against it in the United States courts, namely the vulture funds, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal deletes this information.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation that it has been facing since 2008 as a result of the serious economic crisis that the United States has been hit by invading the country.
So far, the family firm of Gonzalez Sada will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself to reach its plenary, i.e., five judges, in view of the fact that only three have voted.
In the event of failure, a request for a certificate will be filed, which will require a review of the trial by the High Court, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
Worse still, the court rejected a document sent by the Government of Mexico as an amicus curiae ("the court's friend"), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, signaling that it is exempt from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries in order to link it to section 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Carambol from two sides: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Total balance
In view of the months-long delay in the complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrage Andrade, who is charged with fraud, the Trade Union Association of Aviator Pilots has already discovered a bottleneck.
Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino's office has just submitted a criminal case against the National Banks and Securities Commission, which is charged with obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory body has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the trust fund of the F/589 bank of IXE, on behalf of Mexico Airlines.
Resources would be directed towards the purchase of shares of the Hotel Professional Manager.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas Hotel Network.
Circled by Dragon Martin
On the weekend of the Forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of local and foreign ecologists, academics, businessmen and members of the general civil society endorsed the creation of a broad front to confront the opening of China's Dragon Martin in Cancún.
We're talking, as you know, about a giant center for the sale and distribution to Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean of the products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for 150 companies.
In the past, Canacintra has been able to unite the governors of the south-east zone to confront the monumental forces that have levelled off some of the protected areas and posed serious threats to the industry.
ACTA Death
With regard to the Government's request to the Senate to explain the circumstances and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known as the Acronym in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case had already been archived.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of viewing it as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Hearten Reyes, a long-time basketball traveler, had been associated with this sport for over 60 years and, thanks to it, had traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Heatin" Reyes.
And before the brain hemorrhaging in 2008, Reyes had been immersed in a wheelchair for over 60 years, as a player in small classes, as a player in the High Basketball League, as a commissioner and head of the BSN with the Baaemon Cowboys, and as the president of the Basketball Federation.
"I played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including at the same time as I was president of the BSN, the Director-General of the National Team, and the president of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes remembers when Primera Hora visited his home in Bayamon, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate by making that statement.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things gathered along his long way, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he retains those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid 1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed most because I was able to be part of eight Cowboys since 1967, as an agent, as a co-agent, or as a manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincey's debut at BSN.
From that moment on, Cuco Ortiz, who was a great administrator, became the manager,” Reyes pointed out.
I remember that Gene Bartov, who was on his way here and was at Alabama University, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Do you want to?"
And that was the start of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended a sniper, Raymond Gauss, who had become a national and one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincy had brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys' Champion with Gauss, but I was already away, because by 1988 I was the head of the Federation.
By that time, I had preferred to enjoy his achievements and those of Mincey in the national team.
I remember the first time we won from the US during the Olympic Qualifications tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we won fourth place, and it was supposed to be bronze, if it weren't for the Canadian judge who made us overplay the final game, Reyes said.
That team at the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She was among the best, as was the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and crashed the U.S. team, which was quite like the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Mincy, Gaussa, Ramona Rivas, Fico López and Piculin (Ortisa), but also the Young (Havier) "Tonyto" Colon and James Carter, the Brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Kichote" Morales, who were unable to participate in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but which brought us a golden medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifications tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role-players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice, and young Rolando Hurrouitner to replace the players suspended for messing up in the Pan-American Mar del Plata Cup, we won the gold despite all the predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico had dominated that level in the way Piculin did.
And that doesn't include his career in the various leagues he's been playing.
Who was the best Puerto Rican manager?
It's a very complex question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I love the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you think is your main achievement in the Federation?
He participated in the most glorious period of the national team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce play only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's superfluous.
At the very least, I see the benefits of mandatory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoying the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always with me.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world-renowned for his main role as John Ross Ewing, more known as "J.R.", in a TV series called "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil, and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as J.R. Yuing's oil magnate in the Dallas TV series was a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday night due to complications caused by cancer, according to the family's statement to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas studio.
"Larry returned to his favorite hometown Dallas, again playing the role he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, said her representative, Geoffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, fun, sweet, and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," affirmed Gray in the statement.
He was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and had a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained prominence on TV by playing a good-looking role in the easy comedy "I Dream of Jeanne", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changing when he meets the attractive Jeanne girl that Barbara Eden is playing, and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of the two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included well-received roles by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterpiece of the detestable J.R.'s interpretation that led Hagman to the top of fame.
The CBS drama series about the Yuings and other characters in his entourage was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The ad-hoc slogan "Who shot J.R.?", designed to create a fuss around the episode, full of emotions in which Hagman's character was almost killed, generated international discussions and millions of dollars at risk in bookies.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the show at that time.
When the November 1980 episode was answered, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned "Dallas" into the second most entertaining program in history, after the final "MASH" in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
She was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (in the service of Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. interfered with her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not get out of town, but the others also had a reason to attack him.
Hagman played Yuing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his husband to be treated by an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what must be on the J.R." Hegman said in 1988.
It must say, "Here lies an honest citizen, J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Princeipal, also the character of the original show, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone "growing, both on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of admirers all over the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have had the privilege of knowing and loving it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas issue were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Five episodes of the second season and six in production were finished, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what will happen to the show after Hagman left.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of Mary Martin's actress and singer, who was glowing in classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to Ben Hagman.
He tried to be happy in the theater scenes of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force of England from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, Mai Axelson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tale (and Absolutely True) Tales out of My Life.
"I didn't put anything in it that I thought was capable of hurting anyone or influencing them in any way," he said to Prenza Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he promoted organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients with fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go into surgery, and after," he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He had also been active in anti-smoking and had been involved in several campaigns.
A course is under way that explores the end of the world.
Every week, students study apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when professor of religion, Stuart Sharma, decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible bait: the end of the Mayan "long back" calendar, on 21 December, for which many people had taken hold as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was coming in the next couple of months: the catastrophic storm Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the long-armageddon, and the growing conflict that Israel is taking in, a place where Christian end-of-time theorists believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharma this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey.
If we look at what is happening in the world today, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember, bad is good for those who have apocalyptic thinking.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Tempple, professor Barry Wacker holds a course on media, culture and the end of the world.
Every week, students study apocalyptic subjects, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're looking at why these ideas spread over time," he said, "and the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that cause certain human actions.
If nuclear material fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they related to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students what might be plausible and impossible," said Walker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American history, Matthew Restall, and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art and anthropology, united to read a course called the "End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the end of the world doesn't come," said Restall.
Despite the “immediate destruction”, students must learn, prepare projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be accepted on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work “until the very night that the world is supposed to end,” said Restall.
Courses have proved to be quite popular.
"The place was over in two hours," said Restall about his high-medium class, to which 35 students had registered.
We've been getting e-mail messages for weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who've been asking if there's any more space.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student at the Department of Religion and Sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And apocalyptic thinking, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Vequez, a 25-year-old student in the Psychology and Nursery Department, said he had watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course to teach it," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed - let alone the professor - said he believed in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project was about the Maya prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," said Julie Sieglen, a 21-year-old student at the University of Tempple of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; this is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he pointed out that there is apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which lasts for centuries, where people react to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on the end of the world there.
"The Philippines does not take part at the end of the world," he wrote, implying a superior order.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that for a long time it had been said that many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people will start to think about the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers take care of this date.
Some say they're gonna go to the end of the world party.
"Maybe I'll call one of my friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student at the telecommunications department.
