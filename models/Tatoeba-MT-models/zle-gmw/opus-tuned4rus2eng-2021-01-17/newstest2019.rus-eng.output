Number of new recruits preparing to be sent to Donbas from Ukraine
Andrei Marocko, an official of the self-proclaimed Lugano People ' s Republic (LNP), stated that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbas in the winter of 2018-2019.
According to him, Kiev is planning “to complete the units somehow”.
“The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Army, mass dismissals have led to a low level of force”, said Marocko, quoted by RIA News.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainian conscripts could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kyiv launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a Joint Forces (JFOR) operation.
This measure was intended to strengthen the role of Ukrainian Silovists in the resolution of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbassa was aggravated by the murder of the head of the DND, Alexander Zaharchenko.
The DNR authorities have described what happened as a terrorist attack.
In the course of the investigation of the criminal case, several persons involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary information, they confirmed that the sabotage had been carried out by Ukrainian intelligence agencies.
The U.S. authorities forced Mask to leave the presidency of Tesla.
An American businessman, Ilon Musk, will leave the position of chairman of the board of directors of Tesla, a company founded by him, at the request of the U.S. authorities.
In order to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial arrangement with the department allows Mask to remain in the leadership position at Tesla.
In doing so, he is required to pay $20 million and leave the office of chairman of the board of directors within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is clarified that the agreement has yet to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it was reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Mask of misleading shareholders by claiming sufficient funds to buy the company’s shares and suing the entrepreneur.
It's about a Twitter businessman who claimed he wanted to buy Tesla shares for $420 a piece, but he never did.
After the tweet, the company's shares grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British MIDA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the EU with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of captivity to the member countries of the community.
The diplomat made this statement at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
According to Daily Mail, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to defend freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from a community to a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity,” the Minister said.
He added that trying to punish Britain for its decision to withdraw from the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, noting Gaceta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May stated that the Brexit talks had stalled.
So she commented on the outcome of the EU informal summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was taken in 2016 by referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will work together after London leaves the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.
Two dogs were given to the President of South Korea, who received mushrooms from the DPRK.
South Korean President Mun Jae In received two puppies from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after his visit to Pyongyang.
Reuters reports this with reference to a representative of the South Korean President's administration.

The North Korean side handed a few kilograms of feed to the dogs for about a year, “as a help to adapt them”.
A gift was given in honour of the inter-Korean summit held from 18 to 20 September in Pyongyang.
The hunter phunsan from the North Korean wolves received its name from a district in the DPRK.
According to the agency, Moon loves animals, he already has two of these dogs that the last North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, gave him.
Dogs aren't the only gift.
Kim Jong-un also gave his colleague two tons of delicate matsutake mushrooms.
He ordered the distribution of the mushrooms to families separated during the Korean War who had not yet been reunited with their relatives from the DPRK.
The head of the Altai village council stopped the hunger strike for the benefit of the inhabitants.
The deputy announced on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the village council stated that the situation was deadlocked, that the district administration did not respond to his demands, and that he had to carry out his work.
In addition, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has begun to verify the situation, and the heating organization STCP has promised to start work on preparing the system for the winter heating period of the Siberian settlement the following week.
The people of the village council also drafted and removed to the Governor of the Altai region a mass collective treatment “concerning the current catastrophic situation”.
Boronin himself reported that he was feeling well, and he was fully responsible for his duties as head during the hunger strike.
As Boronin explained, the towns of Siberia and Rogulica have centralized heating systems, which means that the authorities of the Pervomaysky region have the authority to prepare them for the winter.
To date, however, no one has started the work.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support by the Government of the Altai province and against the financial policy of Gazprominterregiongas Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the villages for the winter, Boronin demanded “the immediate establishment of a full-fledged and autonomous communal area with the corresponding staff units in the municipality”.
Named Moscow's new buildings with the cheapest apartments
In the first six months of 2018, Moscow purchased about 3,000 housing units ranging from 30 square metres and worth up to 4 million roubles.
More than half of these transactions took place in two VCs, as the Urbanus portal records (available at Lenta.ru).

Urbanus analysts note that the proportion of transactions with apartments up to four million roubles in these facilities reaches 60 per cent of the total sales and provides half of the total revenue.
“The impact of apartments with a budget of less than four million roubles should be recognized on the commercial success of the Central District in the New Watutinkas and the Lug VC,” says a study of two other New Moscow LCs.
They generate about 35 per cent of financial revenue.
Previously, the ratings for Moscow's cheapest apartments in the new buildings were presented to the Bon Ton Real Estate Agency.

On 13 April, the Tagan Court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's claim to block Messinger Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the communication operators proceeded to implement the decision.

In August, Telegram changed the policy of confidentiality and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of the suspected terrorist user when a court decision was obtained.
Telegram has been reduced by 1.2 million since the blockage in the Russian Federation.

A very important victory for us.

They knew that Dinamo had a good victory before we met, so they were prepared very seriously.
It was important to drop in most, I'm glad for the guys who went out to realize the numerical advantage.
We've been playing pretty well in most of the time lately, but we couldn't score.
At last, the red light was lit outside the gate.
We knew Minsk was going to be loaded for the game, he'd try, and that's what happened.
The game in most became decisive, and the winning goal we scored was in unequal composition.
We managed to have a good third period today, despite the fact that we missed the early goal in this segment and it was clear that it would not be easy in the future.
But we played very well in defense, we didn't give a lot of chances to the opponent, we didn't let them catch us on shifts, Dinamo didn't have a numerically advantaged attack, so it ended well for us, says Hartley's press service at the Omi Club.

Ilon Musk is forced to resign as head of the Board of Directors of Tesla
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Musk settled their fraud dispute.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the television channel, Mask will have to leave the board of directors of Tesla as part of the agreements reached.
In doing so, the commission allowed Mask to retain the post of Tesla leader.
It is noted that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be collected from Tesla.
The money will be distributed to affected investors.
In addition, the company is required to appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American entrepreneur on the list of the 50 richest people on the planet, according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX Space Corporation, the Neuralink neurotechologic company, and the developer of Tesla electric cars, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued the CEO of Tesla Ilon Mask because of his tweet message about a possible buyout.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy out all stock on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The price of $420 was allegedly “because of the importance of this number in marijuana culture”, previously reported by Bloomberg, referring to Stephen Paykin's co-director of the security department of the Commission.
However, Ilon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy the stock.
Commenting on the US Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit against him, the businessman stated that he considered the allegations of fraud to be unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Truth is the most important thing in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn't break it in any way," said a businessman in an interview with CNBC.
However, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective suit against the Mask, complaining about financial losses suffered.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders claimed that the tweets of the businessman were misleading, forcing Tesla stock sellers to purchase papers at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that the reckless statements of Ilon Mask led to sharp fluctuations in course.
In September, Ilona Musk was accused of trading fraud by the head of the Citron Research research company.
In the meantime, if Musk had not been able to settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been at risk of being suspended and even imprisoned.
In particular, CNBC's former chairman, Harvey Pitt, claimed this.
Mask is "a good guy who can't run a car company."

The RPT compared the possible renaming of the CPI with the fascists
The head of the Division of External Relations of the Church (OECS) of the Moscow Patriarchate of the Mitropolitan Volocolamski Ilarion compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists in Germany.
Mitropolitan Volocolam Ilarion - about the causes of the conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchate, possible church division and its political connotation
According to him, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage”, changing the name of the church is as if in Nazi Germany, “the Jews are wearing a yellow six-end star”.
"It means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and for that purpose this bill was created," said the RPT representative on the TV channel Russia 24.
Mitropolitan also stressed that the UCP is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, because “the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country”.
OCP called on the Constantinople exarchs to leave its territory

In the next 10 years, Russia may have its own racing ball.
The vice-premier of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Kozak, stated this, summing up the meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
He also shared the view that Daniel Kwiat would return to Toro Rosso and assessed the attendance of the Russian phase of Formula One.
As a result of our meeting with automakers, it is in the foreseeable future that the creation of the Russian Formula One, which has no similars in the world, is what Dmitry Kozak said.
We must encourage our car manufacturers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I don't think it's possible in that time frame.
I think a more realistic time frame is within the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014, the Marsh team performed under the Russian licence in Formula One.
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors who are willing to invest in the formation of a domestic team in the world race championship in the Formula One class.
I know that there are motorists in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, willing to invest in the formation of the Russian team of Formula One, he noted.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like this.
I suspect that the thought of creating the team has come up, including because of the infrastructure in Sochi."
The Sochi Autodrome is waiting tomorrow.
According to Dmitri Kozak, the organizers were able to sell all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even at the qualifications of the rostrum, it was almost complete, noted the vice-premier.
I can tell you that this year's revenue has increased by 72% compared to last year.
It's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the utilization of Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitri Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian motorists was the return of Daniel Quyat to the Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him success next season, the vice-premier said to the news.
He's a very hopeful rider.
Next year, for the first time in history, Formula 1 will be able to take part in the two main Russian pilots.
Although the fate of Sergey Orotkin in the Royal Races remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not as yet impressive: he took 18th place in Russia's Grand Prix.
Let's hope next season there will be more of our main pilots than this year, says Dmitry Kozak.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, the British bacteria Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of an era of modern antibiotics, brought global glory to Fleming, and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the selection of penicillin from mold mushrooms wasn't Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, he had been cold, sowing a mucus from his own nose into a Petri cup (a glass lid in which bacteria were tested) and a few days later, he discovered that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
They found penicillin in almost the same way.
Fleming's name was added to the list of the 100 most outstanding individuals in human history.
His discovery, according to many scholars, changed the course of history.
With penicillin, medicine began to deal with most of the oldest diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote, "For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
Experts estimate that Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people.

Where, by the way, my wife and I were drawn to this by a speechful Russian tour guide.
And a few years later, the statue of Alexander Fleming, in full growth, was seen in the most unexpected place in Spain’s capital.
There, near the main arena for the Corrida Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to a man whose efforts they thought had been to save the lives of hundreds of outstanding artisans of the Corrida.
By the way, this very interesting porcelain work, I think, was found there in Madrid, but at a different time, not at all.

He spoke about this in a speech to his supporters in West Virginia, transmitting CNN.
I was tough, and so was he, and we walked forward and backwards, and then we fell in love with each other.

"Trump said they fell in love, how terrible," he mocked the press.
The American leader denied that he had abandoned the issue of the removal from the DPRK of the remains of American soldiers and the release of prisoners.
"I didn't throw anything," stressed the President.

The Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow ("The Iron Man", "The Loved Shakespeare") married producer Brad Falczak.
Although rumours of their wedding had been going on since April, the couple officially concluded only now, on 29 September.
According to People magazine, a private ceremony took place at Paltrow's house on Long Island.
Three tents were installed on her property, one directly married, the other catering, and the third for service personnel.
Among the guests were director Stephen Spielberg (Criminal Guinet), film stars Cameron Diaz, Robert Downey Jr., Liv Tyler, and others.
Paltrow, who was 46 years old on 27 September, met with 47-year-old Brad for three years before he announced his engagement in January this year.
She calls him "the man who was destined for her destiny."
She was previously married to British musician Chris Martin, the leader of Coldplay.
In this marriage, she gave birth to two children: Apple's daughter is 14 years old, Moses' son is 12.
In 2015, the couple filed for divorce.
Gwyneth and Chris didn't have a big celebration in 2003.

Brad was married to a television producer, Suzanne Buchinik, for ten years.
He also has two children from this marriage.

Google will pay Apple $9 billion for default search status
The US Google company will pay $9 billion to remain the default search engine in the Apple Safari browser.
Business Insider reports that payments will increase to $12 billion next year.
Last year, Google paid $3 billion for this option.
It is noted that the annual fee is calculated on the basis of how many Google search calls were made from Siri's voice assistant and the Safari browser on iOS devices.
According to analysts, Google does not benefit from abandoning the default search engine status, as Apple is one of the largest sources of traffic for the search engine.
In early August, Apple became the first American company to capitalize at $1 trillion.
The previously published accounts show that the corporation's net profits in the third quarter increased by 32 per cent over the same period in 2017, reaching $11.5 billion.

Greek anarchists raided an American residence in Athens
Anarchists from Rubicon raided the United States Ambassador's residence in Greece on Sunday, 30 September.
They drove up to the residence on motorcycles, scattered flyers and ran away, reports RIA News.
Prior to his appointment to Greece, Geoffrey Payette was a U.S. ambassador to Kiev.

The armed forces of the Greek State are now taking an active part in the clashes.
Fregat Ally (Greek, Red.), who had been spying on Russian forces for a long time, was involved in a recent Israeli air strike against Iranian targets in Syria.
This led to the destruction of a Russian plane with 15 dead officers, apart from the Syrians and Iranians killed on the ground,” says the faction's statement on the Anarchist community portal.
In addition, Rubicon expressed solidarity with thousands of prisoners in United States prisons struggling with the U.S. system.
Previously, members of the group had entered various organizations, ministries and embassies more than a hundred times, with impunity.
Anarchists raided Iranian, Israeli, Austrian and Saudi embassies.
They managed to take over the Spanish Embassy and to destroy the office of the British non-governmental organization Oxfam, which Rubicon believed was involved in a paedophilia scandal.

Trump told me about "love" in Kim Jong-un.
From mutual violence, the leaders of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea almost fell in love with each other, playing Donald Trump.
U.S. President Donald Trump made a good joke about his success on the frontline of a resolution of the North Korean crisis.
Beginning with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now remedied their relationship so much that they are almost in love with each other, noted the American President.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main challenge in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama’s team had so started a relationship with the DPRK that they couldn’t even reach the country’s leadership that they simply didn’t take off the phone.
The United States and the DPRK were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House "pretty letters," noted Trump.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his job, he was also cruel to Kim Jong-un, which was mutual.
But now their relationship has been refreshed so much that the leaders have fallen in love with each other.
Trump said not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump noted that Pyongyang has recently ceased nuclear and missile testing and has also closed military sites.
It's all the credit for his administration, I'm sure the American president.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump lauded Kim Jong Eun from the United Nations General Assembly rostrum.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump noted, however, that sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore

The positive outcome of the meeting was the cessation of nuclear and missile tests by the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards denuclearization of North Korea are still bouncing.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the US had already sent a number of disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangsters".

Nice called for “the Russian language to be replaced by a Ukrainian product”
Ukrainian child writer and mother tongue purity fighter Laris Nice called for the expulsion of “Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language” from Ukraine.
It offers to do so with a Ukrainian product - a “cultural wave, a cultural push”.
Nice shared her views on the “advisability of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian edition of The Observer.
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is already eating and is continuing to develop further.
In time, Ukrainians will recover from this Moscow language, she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that Russian speech had been used extensively on television and radio, but there was little public space left.
However, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language are, in her view, merely “extension of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
In the past, Nice shared her experience of maintaining a “Ukrainian-speaking regime” in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watsons bookshops, one of which was contacted by a cashier in Russian.
Before she got hers, Nice threw the change at the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in writing names.
Nice recently stated that the name "Rus" had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not avoid the anger of the writer: when she came there and heard the staff talk to each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left with the door.
During the break, we had a man’s conversation, and it worked.
"The Urala" defender, Denis Kulakov, about winning the Arsenal (2:1) at the ninth round of the Russian championship.
"Denis, what do you think won?"
"I think we wanted to win more," quotes Kulakov's official website Urala.
"The game was so complicated, and during the break, there was a serious man talk, and it was fruitful: they beat two balls and didn't miss it.
"You missed a few matches because of the damage you sustained at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today?"
"If it lasted 90 minutes, then it's okay!
Actually, I felt good.
Maybe at the end a little bit of strength to make sure nothing happens.
So, the doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolijevich Gashniev brought me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
"What do you think of the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after victory, it's easier to recover, and the mood in the group is good.
Now we have a white stripe, though it was black at first.
We have to keep doing this and make the fans happy."
"Did you miss the game while you weren't on the field?"
"There's this, a little bored, because the really, really unpleasant situation has come out.
But again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors for getting back on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and made the fans happy.
And the rest is secondary."

In a referendum in Macedonia, violations were recorded
Four incidents involving violations of electoral legislation were recorded in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental renaming treaty with Greece.
This was reported on Sunday by the Spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of polling stations, four incidents have been recorded and resolved, he said.
At the polling station at Lazo Angelowski Elementary School in Skopje, 22-year-old K.J. violated public order and calm, insulted citizens and assaulted police officers.
He was detained and taken to the police station.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all violators were immediately taken to police stations.
The Ministry noted that all violations were subject to verification.
“The Ministry will act in accordance with the law to enable citizens to exercise their constitutional right freely to express their will.
We call upon citizens to respect the law and to refrain from any disturbance of public order and tranquillity and any violation of the secrecy of the vote,” said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
In the Sunday referendum, citizens are asked to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek province.
On 17 June, the heads of the Macedonian and Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic at a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which runs the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
This treaty must resolve not only the multi-year dispute over the name of the country, but also open the way for Skopje to enter NATO and the EU.
Head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Russia ' s decision to deliver C-300 is a timely step.
Russia ' s decision to supply air defence systems (APCs) C-300 to Syria is a timely step.
This opinion was expressed by the head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, in an interview with the RT television channel, which aired on Sunday.

I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very grateful for Russia's efforts in this regard,” the Minister noted.
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that C-300 was a defensive system, not an offensive system, and was designed to protect the Syrian sky.
Pashinian hopes to hold early elections to the Armenian Parliament in 2018
Elections to the Parliament of Armenia can take place as early as 2018, as stated by the Prime Minister of the country, Nicolas Pashinian.
“Perhaps before the end of the year”, the head of government replied to a question from journalists about the timing (interfax citation).
Mr. Pashinian also did not rule out that “return people to the streets” to hold extraordinary elections if discussions with parliamentary forces failed.
But I'm willing to negotiate with the parliamentary forces.
I hope they are also committed to constructive dialogue,” quotes the premiere of the “News Armenia”.
Nicolas Pashinian added that early elections were “the demand of the people”, as well as part of the Government's programme for which Parliament had voted.
The Government's long-term vision, he said, was also necessary to attract investment and economic development.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Pashinian promised, upon his return to Yerevan, to begin “a discussion with representatives of all parliamentary and extra-parliamentary forces to discuss the time and conditions of the early elections”.
In the current Parliament, about half of the deputies represent the opposition Mr. Pashinian of the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA).

The charges against the Dagestan deputy are news.
The Mahachkala Soviet District Court held for two months a member of the Dagestan People ' s Assembly, Rajab Abdoulatip, suspected of involvement in a criminal association that constituted disability for bribery.
OS has become aware of the details of the investigation's materials, which shed light on how, according to the Russian Examining Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the republic, Ramazana Abdoulatip Rajab Abdoulatip, has now facilitated criminal action by the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Investigation, Magomed Mahachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, in the course of the investigative and operational activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was found that Rajab Abdoulatip had lobbied Magomed Mahachev for the post of head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles.
In the past, the investigation of Magomed Mahachev, other leaders and members of the territorial medical and social expert offices under his jurisdiction has been initiated under article 210 (establishment and participation in a criminal association using official status), article 290 (receipt of bribes by an organized group), article 292 (servatory fraud) and article 159 (special fraud) of the Criminal Code.
According to the investigation, in late 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, aware of the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his accomplices in the looting of the Pension Fund, joined their activities by joining the criminal community.
While in the position of Head of the Directorate of the Russian Federal Migration Service for Dagestan and having links with State authorities and law enforcement structures, as well as his relationship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdoulatip, investigators consider that “he provided for the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with State officials to support the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his position as head of the federal penal institution “General Bureau of Medical and Social Investigation of the Republic of Dagestan”, organized the illegal identification of disability of citizens”.
Following the announcement of this information at the meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything I'm charged with today is new to me, I'm completely unfamiliar with it," he said.
The court did not arrest a member of the “One Russia” for 10 days before the indictment, as was the case with the previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for two months immediately, as article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation appeared in his case.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time to be charged with an investigation, up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

Evkurov responded to the “fantasers” oil claims
The Ingush village of Dattih, where oil is supposed to be extracted, will not be transferred to Chechnya.

It takes 100 rubles to make one rouble, adding the Evkurs.
Of the 19 boreholes listed, 16 are in Ingushetia and are in the balance sheet of the UAO “RN Ingneft”, which is transferred to Interfax.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia was virtually non-existent.
The head of the Federation Council Committee for International Affairs, Constantine Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a success for Russia, and does not rule out that it will be a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric that we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been more depressing,” said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation had sometimes “noted as one of the three major threats to humanity, but, in addition to the Ebola fever, the Russian Federation, along with climate change or terrorism, was in that category, in any case, in a statement by a group of Western countries, which had expressed itself quite unanimously”.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed that “the topic of Russia was virtually non-existent”.
“If you carefully analyse the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the German Foreign Minister, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at any rate, the choir was not quite accurate,” he drew the attention of the politician, noting that Russia “was no longer a wall that was being trained by a tennis ball.
The head of the Sovfed substantive committee does not rule out that this indicates a trend that he believes will “shall be singled out for the current session [of the UN [Gnessemble], although this trend may be fully apparent in a year, two, three”.
“I do not rule out that this session may in some sense be a turning point”, Kosachev admitted, explaining that “there are too many examples of how Russia can move forward with its involvement in international affairs.”
He cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea as an example.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will be needed over time," added the parliamentarian.
This is related to the fact that he believes that there is “an adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible — an integral part in solving the global problems of our time”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have the feeling that we're going through a point somewhere where movement is no longer going backwards, it's going to be moving forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context was described by Kosachev as “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should evolve”.
“I have attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and I have met with great pleasure, and I have seen that if the Russian opinion, in a year or two or five years ago, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, in large part, no one has asked, the situation is different,” said the Chairman of the Sovfed Committee.
In his view, this is because “the so-called new liberal order that represents the West has no answers to how to deal with the world's problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to deal with the Middle East, terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation and migration”.
“And here, the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more apparent,” he expressed his confidence, stressing that in this sense he considers “the current session to be a good one for the Russian delegation's work, a good one for Russia.”
The Orphan was the last one to finish at the Russian Grand Prix, Formula One.
That's a great score for Max.
Given that he started at number 19!
That's a birthday.
The Dutchman's upset, though.
And we congratulate Hamilton.
His break-up from Fettel increased by 50 points.
Bottas is on the side looking indignant, I guess.
In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that military force will not be required in the Syrian province of Idlib, as stated by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
Syria, he said, was entitled to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to resolve quickly the issue of the withdrawal of the militants from the demilitarized zone in Idlib by the Russian-prohibited organization Jebhat al-Nusra, reports the RIA News.
The head of MIDA also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of Euphrates if the Kurds were to seek separatism.
At the same time, Muallem believed that the talks with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted because of the US.
On 17 September, Putin and President Recep Erdoğan of Turkey agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by 15 October.
Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.
It was previously reported that a 37-year-old defender had been negotiating the transition to the Moscow Spartacus.
According to RT, with reference to Mirror, former captain John Terry of England led the Chelsey Youth Team.
According to the source, a well-known player who has long been a member of the London Club will lead the team at least 23 years of age.
It's noted that Terry's coaching staff will replace Jody Morris, who left for Durby County.
To recall, in September Terry was close to moving to the Moscow Spartacus, but eventually abandoned the idea after talking to his family.
First Vice-Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Irina Gerashchenko, apologized to a convict in the Russian Federation for “spionage” by the Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko for not being able to release him.
She said this in a video message to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko FSB.
According to her, these days there is an action under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, which announced a hunger protest demanding the release of the prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural leaders, among them, there are people who know you, who starve to support Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview, no place where the President of Ukraine, Ukrainian power, all of us, have demanded pressure on the Kremlin, no pressure on Putin with one demand: the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all the political prisoners of the Kremlin and those children illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbassa and Crimea,” said Herashchenko.
She also expressed confidence that the tests would stab every Ukrainian, making us “more angry, more stern in defending Ukraine's national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil”.
Recall that the correspondent of Ucrinform in France, Roman Sushchenko, was arrested by Russian silos on September 30, 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage against the General Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years of high-security colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia found the verdict to be lawful.
Russian prison guards granted the last request of the Ukrainian before he was staged into the colony.
NASA reported an asteroid approaching Earth the size of Big Ben.
The American Space Agency NASA reported that a large asteroid SP1 is approaching the Earth, which can be as long as 160 m.
According to the Daily Express, a space object may exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or the London wheel of view.
However, the exact size is not yet known.
The speed with which SP1 is moving is about 60,000 km/h. The smallest distance between the asteroid and Earth will be on October 3.
Then it will pass our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first spotted on September 19.
NASA listed it as near-Earth objects.
Earlier, on September 27, Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency published the first ever video of Rugu's asteroid surface.
Two Japanese rovers (planetic riders) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe managed to extract unique images.
The wrinkle of the football lawn of the CM-2018 stadium was attributed to Baste.
The damage to the football lawn at Rostov-na-Donu stadium was linked to a concert by Russian rapper Vasily Vaculenko, or Basta.
Photo published in Instagram account hd7tv.
"We're very good with Baste and his creativity, but... sorry for the lawn," says the signature to the photos.
The comments alleged that the protective coating (special tiles) caused damage to grass at the edge of the field.
The concert, scheduled for 29 September, was never cancelled.
The Rustov Football Club, as well as the Russian Premier League, opposed the concert.
"I want to know the names of those football players and Rostova representatives who claim that my performance could be detrimental, disrupting the activities and development of the football club, as well as influencing the performance of its players," Basta wrote in response to criticism.
Rostov Arena is one of the stadiums of the World Cup 2018.
It held five tournaments.

The agreement with the group of companies, Formula-1, provides for the Russian Grand Prix races to take place every year from 2014 to 2025.
"I couldn't even hold a spoon."
Vahtang Kikabidze on cancer control
Many artists now talk about how they managed to cope with oncology.
Unfortunately, the disease spares no one, and the stories of popular people about winning cancer give hope to many patients.
A famous actor, Wahtang Kikabidze, admitted that he was only alive because of his wife.
Years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
"It's like I've been hit with a hammer down my skull.
I fell.
Lost his orientation.
They put it in the hospital.
He couldn't hold the spoon, he couldn't stand there, he fell all the time.
They started doing tests, it turns out it's bad, the artery won't let you bleed.
They brought me to Moscow, and they said I had a big cyst in my head, and they had an emergency surgery.
And during the surgery, the doctors behind the cyst saw a tumor," told Kikabidze in "One Day."
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol at his doorstep.
But the actor's wife wouldn't let a live actor be buried, and she believed that she would be able to cope with the disease, and she never left her beloved husband's bed for more than a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I'd be dead right now.
Always when I had critical situations, she was there like a rock," the actor confessed.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, and now he lives happily in his home in mid-Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumours of his illness, and of the untimely death that ever happens on the Web.
The creators of the Peacemaker site added Peter Siyarto, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, to the “Purgatory” section.
The motive was “the attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the neighbouring country was found guilty of “direct threats of invasion of Ukraine” and “support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine”, as well as of “participation in the organization of provocation aimed at mass violations by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian law”.
Note that the vice-president of Kievo-Pecherska Lavra Pavel and the leader of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) Onufriy have been welcome to Ciyarto in the Purity.
Their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian subsidiary church was the motive.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatia, the President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, demanded respect for Ukraine ' s sovereign rights.
The authorities have named the sum of the gold parachute of the Vorones' Zangubernator.
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to Deputy Governor of the Voronezh province, Yuri Agibalova, was made under the Regional Public Positions Act.
However, the real amount of the gold parachute released from the office of the vrio official was several times lower than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations were provided by the regional government press service.
According to the law, the salary for the position of Agibalov is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, in the press service, the lump sum was 223,892 roubles less income tax, rather than the 1 million roubles reported by the media.
He received an old-age insurance pension from July 2018.
He has been in public office for more than nine years.
This pension and a lump sum are awarded immediately upon separation from office, as explained to RIA News in the region's government.
At the same time, the payment of the supplemental pension to Agibalava was suspended on appointment to public office and his salary remained unchanged from the previous period.
Winning Governor Vrio of the Alexander Gusev region took office on 15 September.
Agibalova was dismissed on the expiry of the term of office of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region have ended.
On 29 September, Telegram Channel Nezigar published documents showing that Agibalova, who had resigned from his post as vice-governor, had paid a termination indemnity in the amount of 23 salaries, and two days after that, he had again received a similar post without a "Vrio" post.
Deputy State Duma called for students to be informed of the harm of masturbation.
Onishchenko holds the post of First Vice-Chairman of the Education and Science Committee.
On the basis of his experience, he noted in an interview that young people are provoking masturbation through harmful information they find online.
The fight against this is at the level of educational institutions and the family, and the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, MP of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with Radio Voice Moscow):
As part of the general sex education of children, this must be done by explaining the harm caused by the risk of sexual health of the child, both boys and girls.
The problem is objective, it is that the children's maturity is early enough, and there are large scissors between their puberty and the possibility of formal intersex contacts.
Onishchenko is of the view that the problem is hampered by “faithfulness”, the silence of “sexual age” and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers face masturbation.
The deputy believes that teaching about the harm of mahnism is first and foremost in schools in hyperurbanized regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, you and I will simply not understand, to say the least," said the professor.
Gennady Onishchenko is an active RAMN academist, member of the Bureau of RAM, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Professor.
A well-deserved physician from Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the bureau of the Russian public organization, the League of Health of the Nation.
The families of the victims in Ismailovsky will be helped by the "Teplosat"
The Heathouse will provide assistance to the families of the victims when the pipe breaks in the Ismaylova Prospect.
The family was told about it in the company immediately after the tragedy.
Recall that the pipe in the courtyard of the house on the Ismailov Prospect occurred on 28 September.
As a result of the tragedy, several cars collapsed under asphalt, and two young people died on the spot from burns.
ADH became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" scores another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings fall.
It seems that Germans have become seriously tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most notably, recent social surveys indicate that the anti-immigrant party “Alternative for Germany” is becoming more popular and that the positions of the ruling Merkel and Zeehofer bloc are becoming weaker.
This week, ADG broke another record, rising to number two in the popular sympathies rating.
Right-wing conservatives with 17% popularity managed to bypass social Democrats with about 16%.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to statistical error, but it cannot be overlooked that the fact that the AG of a small group of Euro-Ceptic economists established in 2013 has become a major political force.
The leadership in the total set-off has so far continued to hold the ruling block of the HCC/HDZ, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards the loss of points, as early as April, the support for the Angela Merkel bloc was four percentage points higher.
The German Chancellor's personal rating, which leads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans are in favor of Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
Let's add that the social Democrats are followed by the green (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%).
Evolution of the Alternatives
The party "Alternative for Germany" was formed in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative Choice 2013", which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government course, but first, it dealt only with economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's “sponsing” of weak EU economies, not excluding the possibility of a return to the German brand and a complete withdrawal from the EU.
As the immigration crisis deepened, the ADG political platform expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took over the euro-skeptic niche and began to criticize the government for failing immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, ADH was able to make the first entry into the Bundestag with 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternatives for Germany" get a seat in the European Parliament.
A video was published of a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens a "nothing of fools"
He is the host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books, Osp Drosdov, on live television, confessed that he considered his countrymen to be "a hunch of fools."
They believe in TV and don't read much.
According to Drosdov, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We haven't been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since we were kids," said the journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Television and Radio Broadcasting Committee of Independent States has begun to combat literature, which contains the slightest hints of criticism of the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the importation of as many as 201 editions.
Manchester City beat Brighton and became the leader of the APL.
In the seventh round of England's Manchester City Championships, Brighton played at his field with a score of 2:0.
Rahim Sterling and Sergio Aguero, the winners of the meeting, scored for the 29th and 65th minutes, respectively.
"Manchester City", who knows no defeats, went to the 19th point of the tournament table with a single point, "Liverpool", to play with "Chelsey" today, and "Brighton" put it on the 15th line with five points in the asset.
On the next tour, the wardens of Josepa Guardiola will play with Liverpool on their way out on 7 October, and the Chaki will take West Ham two days earlier.
The Canadians built a car in case of an apocalypse, a driving magazine.
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Rochel Defence Solutions stated that it had already accepted applications for its new armour.
Rochel Senator APC Apocalypse Armord
The theme of the apocalypse is not just that of video games, film studios, and book publishers.
A new niche is now being developed by car companies.
For example, the Canadian Rosel Defence Solutions presented its armored armor of the Centor APC.
In a fantasy-free time, this company's engineers are building armoured vehicles for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are not very comfortable, but are safely placed in a whole-ware armored cassette.
This bunker, otherwise it's not a design because it's booked according to standard B7, is installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, is capable of protecting the capsule from grenade and anti-personnel mines.
Apocalypse Armoured Salon of Rochel Senator APC
In order to prevent passengers from being harmed even by an explosive wave from a bomb exploded near the vehicle, the car’s cabin is equipped with special amortizing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
The Rochel Senator APC vehicle is equipped with a camera system with a night vision function, as well as an inspection armored tower on the roof.
No weapons in the car.
Front of the Apocalypse armor compartment of Rochel Senator APC
In order not to affect the mobility of the armoured vehicle, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbo-diesel engine of 6.7 litres, the power of which is transferred to the four wheels of the armoured vehicle through a 6-step automatic transmission.
There's no chance of being stuck in the armored apocalypse of Roshel Senator APC.
A special exhibition in Washington, D.C., will be held in October to see the armoured apocalypse of Rochel Senator APC.
Named the time of death of the universe
The universe lasts an additional 140 billion years, ten times the age of the world’s observable, about 13.8 billion years.
A study by an international team of scientists has been placed in the electronics library arXiv.org and has been sent for publication in the Journal of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reported by the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts have come to similar conclusions by monitoring the Subaru telescope using the HSC camera for about 10 million galaxies.
After tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 per cent of the energy of the observed world, scientists, working under the standard cosmological model CDM ( > Cold Dark Matter), rated the expansion of the universe, which was a little slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Subaru Observatory noted that observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and that the European Space Telescope Planck had clarified the limitations imposed on the parameters of CDM.
In July, scientists modelled the possible destruction of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments to the effect that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap.
Another attempt to merge the initiators of the pension referendum failed.
The opportunity to learn people ' s views on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal general initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that recorded different language issues (a total of five were registered by the Centre).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians, "Would you like the age set by the pension legislation as of 1 July 2018, at which time Russian citizens are entitled to old-age pension, not to be raised?"
This wording was registered by a sub-group of moisture, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the most simple and legal vessel.
The majority of the participants in the meeting were supporters of the member of Fair Russia, Ilya Sviridova (six sub-groups) and the CADP (four sub-groups).
Three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg, joined.
Sviridov had previously said to the “Reports” that the invitations had been sent to all initiators and that some 40 sub-groups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who led the sub-group of moisture (her wording was supported by another 15 sub-groups), said, "References," that the invitation had not been received and that she had not planned to come, "We didn't understand who the friend was and who the enemy was."
Blues singer Otis Rush died.
At the age of 84, the famous Chicago blues guitarist and singer Otis Rush died, reporting to AP with reference to his manager Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following a stroke in 2003.
Mr. Rush's creativity has influenced musicians like Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.
He was well-known in 1956 after the release of the song "I Can't Quit You Baby", which took the sixth line of the "Billboard R&B" rating.
The Admiral has caused us great problems.
Zinatuela Bileletdinov: "Admiral" has caused us great problems.
The Chief Trainer of Aq Barsa, Zinatula Biletdinov, summed up the results of the regular KHL championship against Admiral (4:2).
"The game was complicated, complicated.
The rival fought well, caused us great problems.
I'm glad we played pretty well in most of us today.
I've already told you, the goal will come one day, so that we can work on it.
And that we won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this episode?"
"We have our own program that he works on.
That's why there was such a solution," quotes the club's Bilaletdin Press Service.
Ilon Musk will leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk will be required to leave the board of directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the position of CEO of the company, reporting to AFP with reference to the regulator's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
Previously, the regulator filed a lawsuit against Ilon Mask - officials thought he had misled Tesla investors because the businessman allowed the purchase of all company shares at a high price of $420 per paper.
In the Loko-Ahmat match, Turbine's mistakes fell like a horn of abundance.
A former all-union judge, Vladimir Levitin, commented on the work of Arbitrator Evgeny Turbine in the 9th round of the Russian Locomotive-Ahmat competition and dealt with controversial episodes of the game.
How do you judge Evgeny Turbine in the Locomotive-Ahmat match?
- I believe that this arbiter has confirmed his unfit for trial by the Russian Prime League.
I am surprised that the pressures of the fifth round of Spartacus - Dinamo, neither Turbine nor the leaders of DSI, have come to serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of gross techniques fell as a horn of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute, Eder's railroadman lays his hands in his fine square with the protector of Akhmata Rodolfo.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbine doesn't put a penalty on it.
How do you rate the episode of Idov, who was at the 82nd minute when it seemed like the ball hit his arm?
- I believe there was a deliberate hand-playing of a lawyer in his fine square.
Turbin was next to the moment, and he could see the episode and his first assistant on the right.
Judge Sergey Karasev should have seen that moment.
Nevertheless, all three fell asleep, and the penalty was not imposed.
So the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice has been shattered.
It was the very time that the judiciary was replaced and buried by the sporting spirit of the game.
At the 52nd minute, Turbine did not decide to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second mustard?
- Turbine and the first yellow card weren't exactly business at this point.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match that there were double standards of justice, that some teams were being punished for violations like Idova and some of them weren't.
What do you value from a football player?
- Depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give it.
So the arbiter doesn't give the second penalty to the opposite gate.
Here's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge watches who's playing.
Here he was playing Locomotive on Saturday, and Ahmat has serious concerns about Turbin's work because the team has been compromised.
Matt Damon played the man charged with raping Judge Cavanaugh at the SNL launch.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the United States Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, who is charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season, "Saturday Night Live" on NBC.
In a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at the Senate hearing on charges of rape.
A candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court has previously drawn attention to his emotionality and the details of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Clobushar.
Cavanaugh, for example, repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but stated that he had never been drunk.
Moreover, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
Damon also beat those moments.
All I did was drink too much, and I didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows it," said the judge in Matt Damon's performance.
Cavanaugh was previously elected Supreme Judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found her cloned dogs strange in behavior.
The American singer Barbra Streisand claimed that the clones of her dead dog were completely different from the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [clons] look like her, but it's impossible to clone a soul," stressed a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Straisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog coton de toulear, named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua dog called Miracle Milly, the world's smallest dog, was cloned for the 49th time.
Professionals are engaged in the cloning of a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The US was thinking about Russia's maritime blockade because of oil and gas supplies.
In the US, Russia’s maritime blockade can begin to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The American authorities are so determined to fight for success in the world hydrocarbon market that they are prepared to resort to the Russian maritime blockade, which remains one of the world’s major energy suppliers.
The possibility of a naval blockade the previous day was told by the head of the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to global practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior does not perform police functions, but civilian functions, including natural resource policies.
Therefore, Zinke ' s statement was within the competence of his department, although it was not deficient for the political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinck stated that the US Navy controlled maritime routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
From Zinke’s words, it was clear that the need could be linked to Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a lion’s share of its revenues from the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main motivation for Moscow's revitalization in the region, I believe Zinke.
The Minister has made it clear that the US continues to expect to lead the world's energy market, becoming the largest oil and gas supplier.
To that end, Washington would have to stifle Russia and Iran and the maritime blockade of trade routes – an acceptable measure in that direction, Zinke believes.
The Kalmish director received good reviews of the festival.
Our countryman, actor Evgeny Sangajiev of the Gogol Center and his film Harmony ("Harmonia") were given special mention of the members of the sixth debut festival of the "Movement" held in Omsk.
The name of the festival diploma states that "this is a signal for the immediate response of the major industrial players in the film."
As is well known, the picture of a young Kalmutz director was presented in the short film programme "Movement, Beginning", where eight cinematries took part.
The main prize in this competition programme was the painting "Yana is Anja the reverse", the director's debut of the actress Yana Glady.
The focus of the National Film Festival for the Debut of the Movement is on a young film, but not on the age of the casters, but on the state of their spirit, desire and ability to risk.
And a graduate of the Elisteen Arts School of P. Chonkushov and RATI-GITISA Yevgeni Sangajeev meet all these requirements.
He's young, talented, creative, and in his creativity, he's looking for new, innovative forms of self-expression.

Supersonic passenger aircraft in the Russian Federation will be supplied for serial production
The series production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
The Director-General of the Zhukovsky Kirill Sipalo Central Aerodynamic Institute stated that.
According to him, the Science Centre works on supersonic issues both in international consortia and in cooperation with the Minprompromtorium.
"As we feel, it will take us two or three years to get a technology demonstration, as well as another 10 or 15 years to get a serial machine that allows for transport across the country," he added.
He clarified that the question now before Russian experts is how to make technology economical and safe at the same time.
At the beginning of September, the PAO developer, Tupolev, stated that the pre-project work on the supersonic passenger aircraft had been completed, and it was estimated that the aircraft would be able to speed up to 1,900 km/h at an altitude of 11 km.

He announced it on CNN.
He stated that he could only confirm the words of the columnist Washington Post that Putin’s aggression against Ukraine had resulted in the unification of Ukrainians.

There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former captain of Chelsea and the English team, John Terry, about why he attended the ninth round of Russia's Spartak-Rostov championship (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club that I'm following.
I've been watching it quite recently, and I was interested in seeing it from the outside.
I can't say I'm a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus, and I want to apologize again for the decision,” says Terry on the Chelsea fan website.
Let's remind you, Rostau, with 18 points, went to third place in the tournament table, and Spartacus, on the fifth line, had 15 points in the asset.
On the next round, the red-and-whites on 7 October will play with Enicea, and the wards of Valeria Carpina will accept Orenburg the day before.
The expensive violin was pawned for nothing.
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnboard in Somerville, Massachusetts, for an old and unpresentative tool, a pawn shop worker offered only $50.
But the experienced manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and asked the expert for advice.
And that's where it turns out that the violin was manufactured in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Gallano and valued at $250,000.
The violin only is estimated to be $16 to $18,000.
The investigation found that the violin was recently stolen from a resident of the city, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the man who handed it over to the pawn shop, but he was not subjected to any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says everyone who brings the violin to the pawn shop will now be asked to play it to make sure it's actually the client's.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are faced with a thrilling confrontation: Spartacus will be welcomed to his Stadium in Tushin Rostov under the leadership of Valeria Karpin, a man known to be not a stranger to the "people's team."
The fact that the clubs now have an equal score of 15 points, and they divide 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, lagging behind the far-reaching Zenith, and being in the same room as the Red-Dar, who's playing with Dinamo tomorrow.
The red-and-white people are in a tough spot right now: the club is back surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly flew in "Rapidou" and recently retreated to the house of "Ahmata".
After the Derby with the CSKA, which ended up a fair tie, Spartacus played at the Black Sea Cup with minimal scores, and it is too early to say whether Russia's most popular club is approaching the crisis.
"Rostov" couldn't win three games in a row, but he doesn't know any defeats for five games.
Let's see if Carpina can prolong the win-win series with such a principled match.
The previous meeting between Karpin's Rostova and Spartacus ended in favor of the Metropolitan Team.
It starts at 7:00.
Indonesia is shaken by the aftershock after a powerful tsunami

London came up with accusations against Moscow.
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, as British Defense Minister Gavin Williamson said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
Threats are increasing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, enemies are operating in grey areas through cyberattacks and false news, added the Minister.
But the biggest one is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians have repeatedly been refuted by Moscow and transmitted to TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and used chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March this year, ex-colonel Sergey Skripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.

She has been translating Russian and English for more than 30 years.

According to the translator, to understand that two countries need to know each other's history.
And in the future, Saxe pointed out that Germany has no point in ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there's no point in trying to ignore it.

Putin has appointed a new Head of the Office of the President for Foreign Policy
Vladimir Putin, by his decree, freed Alexander Manjosin from the office of Head of the Office of the President for Foreign Policy.
He was replaced by Igor Neverov.
Mr. Manjosin has been running the Office of the President for Foreign Policy since 2004.
One of the reasons for his departure from the Kremlin was that the source “OJ” referred to personal circumstances, noting that there were no substantial claims for quality of work under the head of management.
Igor Neverov was previously headed by the Second European Department of MIDA.
In 2009-2014, he was a Russian ambassador to Sweden.
The Russians donated one ruble for a low-wage deputy.

The campaign can be tracked on the organization's website.
The Human Charity Foundation expresses the hope that the whole world will be able to save the people's servant.
We ask all interested people to give us a chance to live and a happy future!
All the funds collected will be transferred to the poor in person.
God save you!" said the fund.

Reports of assistance received are published on the VKontakte page of the fund, where the organizers post screenshots of remittances.
The most frequent amounts of donations are one rouble and 50 kopecks.
At the time of publication, Russians donated 1633 rubles to Vera Ganz.
Fund-raising began on 28 September following a low-income complaint by Ganzi.

Ganjia visited that parliamentarians were not compensated for hospitality.
Subsequently, the State Duma stated that it would consider the possibility of paying representation fees to deputies.
"The Golden Sculpture" of the San Sebastian Festival received the film "The Between the Two Seas"
The painting "Entre dos aguas" by Spanish director Isaki Lacuesta was recognized as the best film of the 66th International Film Festival in San Sebastian.

The night school comedy was headed by an American box office.
The night school comedy, which debuted at American cinemas last Friday, earned $28 million for its first weekend.
This result allowed an unthinkable picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the United States box office from 28 to 30 September.
On the international market, the film, so far released in only 20 countries, has raised $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the fight for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable, has been quite tangiblely preceded by another new recruit in the west, a cartoon called "Smolfoot", a curious history of a charming Bigfoot meeting a man who the hero never believed in.
The Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig's project of directors raised $23 million for their start-up weekends, meeting the expectations of experts who predicted 20 to 25 million for the weekend.
For Smolfoot's total fees, they now amount to $38.6 million (which has debuted in 50 countries already), with Mexico being the most active in this area, adding $3.6 million to the film's treasury.
Three of the strongest this time, the children's fairy tale "The Mystery of the House with the Hours" from the horror master Eli Roth, finally proved that the director was able to make quality movies for audiences 12+.
In her second week of renting, John Bellers' book with the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett made $12.5 million, bringing the global total to 53.8 million.
Despite the flight from top 3, he continues to be surprised by the sign "+" thriller from Blake Liveley and Anna Kendrick's "Simple Request": in 17 days in the United States, Paul Fig's painting, from which some unrealistic financial performances were not originally expected, raised $43 million (including 6.6 million for 28-30 October) and now has a total revenue of 62.9 million.
The last representative of the first five this week was the Horror of the Noon's Curse, which collected $5.4 million over the reporting period.
Spin-of-the-Sleeves, after 24 days in American (and not only of course) cinemas, has $330 million in earnings and has recently been proud to be the most successful film of the franchise, which also includes two parts of the "Slave" itself and two tapes on Annabel's creepy doll.
Following the horror of Corinne Hardy, a second member of the genre, the debutant of the Hellfest, one of the year’s main youth horrors, was placed in the wake of the last weekend.
On his first weekend, Gregory Plotkin, a famous editor (and a recent director), who had previously worked on a number of large projects, including Happy Death Day, for which Hellfest was very similar, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the results are very positive.
The seventh was "The Crazy Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), who seem to be not thinking of falling out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy that has been on the screen for the seventh week, and the September results are the sixth highest score of the most cash tapes of the genre in history, with a figure of 165.7 million.
This is the sum that has now been earned on the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.
As for the last three lucky people in the United States on the top ten of September 28-30, they were "The Predator", "White Boy Rick" and "Bag Mint", earning $3.7 million, $2.38 million and 1.1 million, respectively, over the past weekend.
And let's add that next weekend in the United States, the long-awaited Vienna with Tom Hardy, who -- you can be sure of that -- will take the lead in American box office after the first weekend of October.
From the other premiere of the coming week, the musical melodrama "Star Born," the winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hate."

Valery Belov: God helped Siberia today.
Valery Belov, chief coach of Vitazja, was defeated by Siberia (3:4) at the regular KHL championship.
"Collelega was talking about Siberia fans, and I want to celebrate our fans," says Belov's official website Vitsia.
"I hope they'll also be supportive, 'cause now almost every game is full of stadiums, great atmosphere.
In the game, I guess God helped Siberia today because they were very grossly wrong, especially our leaders.
We've actually lost the 0:3 micro game, so it's been hard for us to get out of this game, even though there were moments.
But still, I'll take the blame.
Because, apparently, you missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team."
"It's an ugly cummy."
The audience is outraged by Agustina's choice of voice show.
The audience of Voice 60+ accuses Leonid Agustina's mentor of "smuggling and brazen pranks."
When in blind auditions he first learned his father’s voice, Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But his son’s feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative on his team.
At the time, many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor the partiality of the first stage.
But the joke took a long time, and the star's father took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not prepared to forgive Agustina for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, resented the infamous and open way of dragging our next of kin into the final staircase.
I had already doubted that Agutina would have the strength and the conscience not to drag his father to the first place,” Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin reasoned on TV Man.
Meanwhile, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutain "sleed" beautiful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovic whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wanted to see his father's show.
But as it turns out, it's not, the audience wants an objective evaluation and to see really talented performers in the final, and now Agustin has discredited the show.
"I'm sorry for the Vote team from Agustina, they were doomed."
"The last time Agustin showed him how much he loved Dad, "and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave his dad in the project who doesn't sing but whispers, how can you then call a mentor?"
"I like Dad's singing, make him a concert in the Kremlin for your money, and see how many people are coming to this concert."
It's the Voice show, not the Bloody Relatives show.
"It was unprofessional from Agustina's side."
"Then you have to offer your own show to Dad, not the show that is made for the money of Channel One."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other player with real vocal data.
Why did a surgut worker with a great voice and a tembro leak, and Dad Agustina got to the finals?
And then we all complain about the same faces on stage and on screens for decades!
Because you can't get through the cummy!"
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
There's a circle of blah and cummy.
And it's not going to be too much money for the family budget!
The theater of absurdity continues!"
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voices, the son of Gradsky appeared at blind auditions.
Then it never occurred to me to take my son on my own team.
In fact, he said, "Come on, get out of here, I get it."
Agustin couldn't do as a professional.
Military Canada has been allowed to wear beards to boost the spirit
The Department of Defense of Canada issued an order allowing soldiers to wear beards.
According to CBC, the bill contains instructions on beard care.
It is noted that the military may be ordered to shave “for security reasons”.

The ban on wearing beards has been in effect in the Canadian army since World War II.
It was previously reported that police officers in France were also allowed to wear beards and even to have tattoos.
At the same time, the court in Egypt upheld the suspension of police officers wearing beards.

The law enforcement officers managed to apprehend the robber, and they turned out to be a 25-year-old Kievan.
He now faces up to seven years of imprisonment.
The police are also working on the theory of the perpetrator's involvement in other such crimes.
Let me remind you, the day before, there were several resonant robberies in Odessa.
In one case, armed robbers were caught using a drone.
The scientist described a possible scientific programme for the Russian Federation's expedition to the Moon.
The head of the RAN Space Research Institute, RAN correspondent Anatoly Petrukovich, told RIA News about a possible research programme for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
According to him, the scientific community is in the process of developing guidelines for such work.
"No consolidated opinion yet," stressed the scientist.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radiotelescope on the back of the Moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place that such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," he added.
He also believes that the Moon could be used to test robotics and use local resources for construction.
In addition, a scientist believes that astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on Earth's satellite.
This could help to determine how life emerges on planets.
The head of Roscosmos had previously said that the Russian Federation was optimistic that it could fly to the moon by 2030.
An offended client threw out a basket of faeces at 7-Eleven.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, called Florida, had a tooth on the manager of a 7-Eleven 24-hour store: in May, he kicked him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
So he decided to take revenge on his enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the second night, he entered the store and threw it on the floor and on a portion of the goods on the shelves, the contents of the basket that he brought with him.
The basket contained faeces and urine that Simms had borrowed from a nearby mobile biota.
Police officers who arrived at the scene arrested the vigilante.
He was jailed and released before a $300 bail trial.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of someone's property and criminal offence and was prohibited from entering the shop and approaching the manager.
Although Simms' crime appears to be more funny than serious, his conviction may be harsh enough, as he has repeatedly violated the law, including large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, drunk driving and abuse of animals.
The U.S. called Russia's most threatening submarine
The most formidable enemy submarin for the US Navy will be the Russian sub-ship Kazan of the Yasen-M Project, writes The National Interest.
The submarine was released in March 2017, but the Navy will have it in 2019.
According to the publication, even the predecessor of Kazani, the sub of Severodwinsk, was commended by the United States military.
We will face a severe potential adversary.
Just take a look at "Severodwinsk," quotes The National Interest against Admiral Dave Johnson.
The publication states that the United States retains an advantage in this industry over Russia.
The multipurpose nuclear submarines Kazan, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk and Arkhangelsk are built on the improved Yasen-M project (885M).
They have a displacement of 13,800 tons, a depth of 520 metres, a crew of 64, an autonomy of 100 days and a submarine speed of 31 knots.
Submarines are armed with mines, torpedoes 533 mm, Onyx and Caliber cruise missiles.

Deutsche Welle writes about it.
The event was attended by the President of Turkey, Recep Tayip Erdoğan.
Lachet met Erdoğan at Cologne Airport, but refused to go to the mosque, explaining that the event could have become a “extremely politicized event”.
Recker reported having received an informal invitation on the eve of the opening on Friday, 28 September.
According to her Spokesperson, such a proposal should be seen as belated and not serious.
Speaking in front of the mosque, Erdoğan summarized a two-day visit to Germany.
The President described them as successful, he said, and he was able to meet with President Frank-Walter Steinmeyer and Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he discussed, inter alia, the fight against racism and Islamophobia.
The new mosque in Cologne has become one of the largest in Europe and has the capacity to accommodate some 1,100 believers at the same time.
Construction cost 30 million euros, financed by the Turkish side.

I was very impressed for the first game.
I think we're gonna get him into the games.

The VMS identified and detained the owner of the Peugeot 301 car, who traveled the previous day around the capital with license plates of the so-called NPD.
It turned out to be a former employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who currently works as an agent of an insurance company in Ukraine.
According to the U.S. Press Centre, the detainee explained that the vehicle had been wanted by Interpol since 2014, and was therefore detained in Russian territory and handed over to him as a representative of the insurance company.
When he crossed the Ukrainian-Russian border, he removed the fake registration plates, but at the entrance to Kiev he re-established them.
According to him, he did so “to ensure that the registration numbers of the vehicle package were in conformity with the said vehicle issued by the Russian representatives of Interpol in the event that the vehicle was stopped for inspection by the Ukrainian police”.
“A set of measures is currently being implemented to verify the explanations provided, as well as to establish its possible involvement in terrorist activities”, stated the ISA.
We note that in Ukraine the use of numbers issued by terrorists in the territories of Donbassa seized by them is prohibited.

In the United States, a possible maritime blockade of Russia was announced.
If necessary, the United States could impose a maritime blockade on Russia to prevent its supply of energy to the countries of the Middle East.
The U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, has stated this.
Speaking at an industrial event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of the department stated that the only source of income for the Russian economy was energy sales, and Moscow pursued an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas, as it did in Europe, by Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that the situation was similar to that of Iran.
In the view of the Minister, there are two options for dealing with it: military and economic.
He would prefer not to use the former, so pressure must be put on Iranian energy.

There was nothing I could do, and it hurt so much.
Sergei Orotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it hurt so much.
The Russian pilot Williams, Sergey Orotkin, commented on the results of the Russian Grand Prix.
"To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner, I ended up between the two cars that caught me right away.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
Turned out to be in a very bad position.
I'm stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us hit the pit stop, we'd get into clean air, and we'd get back to speed, but the rubber was gone.
Plus, he fought his partner, he had contact with him, too.
I understand he's a little mistaken.
We were in this situation on the roughest track of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," quotes Orokin RIA's words "News."
Let's remind you that the Orothkin in the race at the Russian Grand Prix finished on the 18th, and the winner was the British Mercedes pilot Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called it absurd to suspend Glushakov and Jenko from the base of Spartacus.
The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FDT) Shamil Tarpešchev commented on the suspension of footballers of Moscow's “Spartak” Denis Glushakov and Andrey Jenkko from basic training after liquor to criticize the chief coach of the Massimo Carrera team, reports the Sports Weekend.
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
It's stupid to pay attention to things like that.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the breakdown in the team.
First of all, they're poems, they can be read and understood as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted if I were Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinions.
Second of all, everyone wants to have a good time.
If Glyusakov and Jenko are liking, that doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks flexibility to view the situation.
And it's not a normal climate on the team.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so it didn't have to be a big deal.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
Spartacus has a lot of problems in different lines, there's a lack of identity after the youth is admitted.
Relationships within the team do not seem to add optimism before this match," I'm sure Tarpshawk.
The two teams will play on September 30 and begin at 7:00 Moscow time.
Formerly rejected Spartak, John Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.
Sirius' teachers discussed natural technology with scientists.
Teachers of the Sirius Education Centre in Sochi, members of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the National Research Centre “Kurchatov Institute”.
A presentation by researchers took place as part of a programme of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Environmental Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the website of the education centre on 29 September.
The lecture was opened by a documentary film entitled "Courchatova's Codes", in which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, RAN correspondent Mikhail Kowalchuk, spoke about global challenges as a driving force for civilization.
A lecture by a scientist is published on the Syrius website.
School students learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such amounts.
Environmental technologies that young scientists are working on today will help to solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural-like technologies, as well as the risks inherent in the development of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, a tremendous good.
It's an explosive increase in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's another side.
The development of natural technologies is actually a technological replication of wildlife systems.
There's a backside-- targeted interference with human activity.
There are always risks.
A car showed up and people started to die under the wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I create medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," quotes scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask the participants questions.
Speakers included a Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematics, Iulia Djakov, Head of the Kurchatov Complex of IBICS-like Environmental Technologies, CIT “Kurchatov Institute”, and Viačeslav Demin, Head of the Kurchatov Complex of IBICS-Technicals.
The “Sirius” educational centre in Sochi was established by the “Talant and Success” educational foundation, based on the Olympic infrastructure, at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the education centre is to identify, develop and further professional support for gifted children.
Previously, in September, it was reported that the All-Russia online-opympiades on cybersecurity would be sent to Sirius for training.
A life-threatening air traffic controller rescued a passenger plane during an earthquake in Indonesia
In Indonesia, he said good-bye to Antonius Gunavan Agun, who saved hundreds of passengers in the Batik Air airline at a cost of his life.
On September 28, he worked at Palu's Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie on Sulawesi Island.

Agun refused to leave the command control tower and helped the plane get up.
When the wavelength reached 7,4, the tower began to collapse.
A 21-year-old dispatcher had to jump from four floors.
When he fell, he suffered severe injuries to his internal organs, and the doctors were unable to save him.
The Russian sub Kazan scared the United States.

Macedonia: No referendum due to low attendance
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country “North Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the Macedonians using the name of their historic province.
The change of name led the former Yugoslav Republic to open the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But according to EFE, only 34% of the Sunday plebiscite's appearances were "not reaching" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only of a consultative nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to abandon the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of polling stations, Macedonia's Prime Minister, Zoran Zayev, a supporter of changing the name of the Republic, stated that if there were more yes votes, Macedonia would change the name despite an unattainable quorum.

Kemerovchan has outraged the herd of sheep at the cemetery.
On September 30, an eyewitness reported on a famous Kemerovo social network page that a local cemetery was free to walk horned animals.
A large flock of animals walked between the fence and plucked grass.
Commentators expressed different views: some local residents noted that there was no harm to small cattle in the cemetery and that their appetite could even help to clear the area from weeds and grass, but some residents of the city did not enjoy:
"It's graves, not pastures.
There's nothing for the rams to do there.
Of the rams, of course, you can't say they're shaming, but it's not a big deal."
In one way or another, one eyewitness noted that the animal problem in the middle of the cemetery was already known and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
To push and control, what's the right thing to do?
There's no word to push.
That's right.
The word "press" in the meaning of "stress, influence, influence" exists only phonically, because we hear sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "satisfaction."
We use that word to think it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "satisfaction" are not only not even close, but even in some way opposite.
Make sure you do.
Length (church-book, obsolete) means “satisfied, full, sufficient, sufficient for anyone or anything, sufficient to satisfy”.
Satisfaction, pleasure is related words.
He used to have the meaning of "don't depend on anything, have a self-satisfied value" -- "to be satisfied with yourself."
Old-Slawish "wowl'ti" is related to the words "give" and "wil."
Pushing, suppressing, it's completely different.
These words have truly frightening "reciprocals": daos - "wolf" (repressing sheep), deyja - "death" and dvaid.
A similar phonic appearance of the words “pressure” and “satisfaction”, as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, led them to contaminate.
So we have this very "d" that is used in writing through "a", which is, in a good way, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the creation and development of these words.
Okay, right, let's get it.
But it's an old word that's no longer used in the right sense.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from the top, use the word "press."
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember, it's a cleric.

"Kimi, did you have a chance today to fight for the pole?
How good was the car?"

But our car's behavior has been the best since the beginning of the weekend."

What's the reason?"

He was preparing to try and still managed to miss me, but it seems like I've lost some time on it.
But I don't think it's had a big impact on the result."
"In Sochi, it's very hard to pass, is starting the race the key?"
"Please, yes, but you never know how it's gonna work.
It's not going to be easy anyway, because our car is much slower than Mercedes.

Vučić maintained the highest level of readiness of the Serbian army
The President of Serbia, Alexander Vučić, ordered that the highest level of operational readiness to which the Armed Forces of the country had been assigned be maintained owing to the situation in the north of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.
“The President ordered that the highest level of alert be maintained and that a separate order be issued to cancel it,” said the Serbian Minister of Defence, Alexander Woolin, quoted by TASS on Sunday.
The Head of State, he said, was deeply concerned about developments in Kosovo.

The meeting is scheduled for 2 October and is scheduled to take place in Moscow.
At the same time, the Serbian leader stressed that he would do his utmost to preserve peace and noted that he wanted his country to be a peaceful, successful country of the future.

In Germany, 14,000 people took a demonstration against racism
Some 14,000 people took a demonstration against racism in the German city of Hamburg.
More than 450 organizations under the slogan “Joint against racism” were supported.
The organizers initially reported that some 30,000 demonstrators would take part in the action, calling on the authorities to refuse to deport migrants from the country and to defend the right of people to protection and asylum, according to the newspaper Zeit.
The event also stated that the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea should cease to be an offence.
In addition, the demonstrators demanded the resignation of the head of the Ministry of the Interior of the Federal Republic of Germany, Horst Zeehofer, and the dissolution of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
One participant in the Nevroz Duman campaign stated that the purpose of the demonstration was to demonstrate the unity of society and solidarity in the problem.
Refugees and migrants should not be regarded as others, and migration itself should be the mother of that society.
Numerous migrant communities and anti-racism organizations have sent an open letter to the Minister requesting his resignation.
Russia has protected itself from terrorists through an operation in Syria.
In three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of whom 85,000 have destroyed the Russian Air and Space Forces.
On the occasion of the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former head of the FAC, Victor Bondareev, Head of the Defence and Security Council of the Federation, reported on this.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-to-air weapons: the air-to-space forces had targeted and continued to strike precisely terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, in three years, tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria, such as ammunition warehouses, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, jihadist defenses have been hacked, a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syrian government forces, which is transferred to Interfax.
However, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria has helped to shield Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic were under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, prohibited in Russia) and the Jebhat al-Nusru (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, some 4,000 Russian fighters and some 5,000 citizens of the post-Soviet countries have been fighting on the IG side, and TASS has been handed over.
And these are only the registered persons, apart from those who have not been identified, the Bondarev has stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms at any time, and Russian passports allowed them to enter our territory freely.
So, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at a long distance – otherwise, this evil would “go to us”.
Boris Johnson and a number of British ministers' phones are in the open.
The personal data of a number of former and current British ministers have been made publicly available because of the security failure of the software created by the Conservative Party, and Sky News.

According to the TV channel, a few politicians received "unpleasing calls."
Technical problem solved, now the application is safe.
We're studying the causes of the malfunction and apologizing for any problems caused,” said the Conservative Party.
During the crash, users could not only see confidential data, but also edit information in the profile of politicians and journalists.
For example, in the profile of the Minister of Environment, Environment and Agriculture, Michael Gove, his picture was replaced by a picture of the mediamagnate Rupert Murdock.
Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] Coalition completely destroyed the Syrian town of Rakka, destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it was targeted, and massacred civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes," he said.
According to Muallem, the US and its partners provided “direct support to the terrorists” because the targets of the militants and the western coalition in Syria coincided and meant “the sowing of chaos, death and destruction in their path”.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete and the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intended to rid Syria of its illegal foreign presence and that priority in the reconstruction of the country would be given to Syrian partners.
In September, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, head of the Russian Centre for Reconciliation of the Hostile Parties in the Republic, stated that two United States F-15 aircraft had attacked the Syrian province of Deir al-Zor with prohibited phosphorus munitions.
The United States rejected all charges.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, believes that, while respecting the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
This was announced by the Head of State during his visit to Kharkiv oblast, commenting on the issuance by Hungary of its passports in Zakarpatia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I am defending the sovereignty of our nation.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” stressed Poroshenko.
According to Poroshenko, as President, he will defend Ukrainian citizens wherever they may be, in the east or west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the passport scandal against Hungary, which was intended to expel the consul of that country from the Coast.
"I fully share every letter that is said by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs," noted the President.
According to FACTS, on 19 September, a video was posted on the network recording the time of the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens at the Hungarian Consulate in the Coast of Hungary.
In doing so, they vowed their allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, noted that the consul of Hungary, who appeared in a video of the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, was to leave Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself or would be expelled by Kiev.
It has also been reported that the Zakarpata Regional Prosecutor ' s Office has initiated criminal proceedings for the issuance of Hungarian passports.
The incident is classified under the heading “State treason”.
Putin flew to Siberia secretly.
It is known that Vladimir Putin has spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he participated in the work of the Council of CIS States, and has held a number of bilateral meetings with the Presidents of neighbouring countries.
Data on the flight of Russian "Boat No. 1" on the Flightradar website indicate that about 6 p.m. in Tajik time on 28 September Il-96-300 flew from Dushanbe airport and took a course to the northeast.
In the Balkhas Lake area, the transponder of the plane was turned off.
The direction of his flight suggests that the ship could be flying to Hakasia.
According to the Baikal 24 agency, the president in Abakana met Victor Zimin personally on the night of September 29.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the Republic for a weekend, but the site's sources believe that the real reason is the “second round problem”.
The next Sunday, the second round of elections for the head of the region will be held in Khakasiya.
Valentine Konvalov (CPRF) and the current head of the Republic, Victor Zimin (the only Russia) joined the party.
However, on 21 September, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
Andrei Filjagin ("Just Russia") is to take part in the upcoming tour with Konvalov.
The Khakasian media suggest that Putin can accept the resignation of the head of Hakasia and appoint a new vio to the head of the republic, as well as make a decision about the fate of Zimin.
Putin has already visited Hakasia in January this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the President's favorite rest places.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the outbreak of the armed conflict in Syria for seven years.
Some five million people fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
In the view of Damascus, the hostilities are now nearing completion and the country is ready for voluntary return.
This was stated by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem in his address to the United Nations: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure because of the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which have complicated lives and deprived them of their means of subsistence.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to provide funds for that purpose.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
Volkswagen fully pleaded guilty to "deselgate" in January 2017.
Last December, Oliver Schmidt was sentenced to seven years in prison, one of the managers of the American division of the company.
The contract losses are estimated at at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes more than fines and compensation.
Until June next year, the car manufacturer is required to buy or correct 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company’s management stated that the obligations had already been met for 83 per cent of the vehicles, so that the programme would be completed early.
Volkswagen is always trying to make up for the losses and restore the client's trust.
For example, the management of the firm has recently changed again, as well as extensive restructuring and policy changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy out even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: this power was granted in February this year.

Mitropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UCP with the fascists' actions
The head of the Synodial Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mitropolitan Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It's like wearing a yellow star on a Jew in Nazi Germany, which means labeling the Church as an enemy organization, and that's what this bill was for," said the mitropolitan on the TV channel Russia 24 (interfax citation).
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at an acute stage.
Kyiv thus hopes to gain full control over the CCP and “outlaw it”, the clergyman believes.
"It's a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church think they're Ukrainian, they're patriots of their country," he added.
It has previously been reported that the deputies of the Verkhovnay are pleased to be working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves the renaming of the Moscow Patriarchate ' s PCP.
Vice-President of the Pochayev Laura called for the protection of Orthodox and Ukrainian shrines
The vice-president of the St.-Uspen Pochayev Laura, Mitropolitan Vladimir, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UCP) is published on Saturday on the website.
In various times of history, Christians in the faith and spirit of our predecessors and relatives had to practice their faith and defend their holy places.
Given the situation and the information we have and the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we too will have to survive,” said the Mitropolitan Police.
He asked for support -- prayerful, moral.
Also, the viceroy of the laurel emphasized that it is likely that "your physical presence will be necessary."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren, by spirit, threaten to kill, so we will defend our holy place."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochayev laurah, the Orthodox Ukrainian and the global shrine, needs to be prepared to defend it, says the appeal.
The Mitropolitan called on those who deceive believers not to go about it.
The CCP has a canonical status defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make it dependent on the news patriarch and the Catholic Pope's friend Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is unacceptable to the Orthodox.
And we're pleased with the status that our church has," noted the viceroy of the laurels.
He recalled that the CPI had been canonically independent and fully autonomous in its administration since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?" noted the Mitropolitan Pochayevsky Vladimir, calling upon the believers and all citizens to ask whether the other Tomos have any denominations, are they independent of the Vatican?
Those who believe have figured out to some extent what kind of temple they should go to.
Some, however, want to stir up enmity and discord again.
Some are envious that the domes are shining on the temples they want to destroy, the priest emphasized.
The Postajew laurel is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurels are located on the top of the Pochayev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopol.
Its first historical record dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

Another sad post at the Instagram Bouzoa has pissed off the followers.
The singer and TV host Olga Bouzova cannot survive the betrayal of a member of the show "Married to Bozova" by Evgeny Nazarov, who chose her money and left the project.
A secular lioness published another sad post at Instagram, which made her followers angry.
"I never thought that feelings could have a price.
Life continues to teach me... and when I begin to learn about people, "Buzova wrote.
Many fans reacted negatively to this post and noted that, in fact, the singer had never seen a real life.
"You're the one who hasn't suffered yet.
You cling to every word, live in a normal, normal family," wrote @nataliamama37.
There were also those who advised Bouzova to consult psychologists or at least read books on the subject.
"Maybe you should read psychology literature.
What do you have to do to avoid being a victim?" @liashukgalina wrote.
However, there were others who supported the singer.

Your man will not speak loud words all over the country and then simply not do them,” supported Bouzova @arina_prostile.
"You're the queen and you need the king, and the one who traded you for the paper just doesn't deserve you.
Up your nose and go on," wrote @kerzentia_f.
Nazarov had previously explained her decision to take 2 million rubles and to abandon Bozov because the singer had no sympathy for him.
He decided to send all the money to charity.

Chief Coach of the Moscow "Dinamo" by Vladimir Vorobiev on the defeat of the "Automobilist" (0:1) in the regular KHL championship.
"That was a good game, interesting, though it was going to the goal," mentions Sparrow's official website, "The Automobilist."
"We used to play very easy.
I really liked the first period.
Didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, we got a little stifled, we survived.
But we've been given a little "feed" to remove.
The guys played great, they did the coaching setup.
I think if we keep playing the game the right way, we'll win.
They didn't score, they don't win with zero, but the content of the game was the right one.
Good luck will come if we keep playing in this direction."
"In your opinion, did the Automobilist add to the meeting in Lower Novgorod?"
"Then the foreign line didn't play.
At the pre-season, teams were doing other tasks, playing a lot of young guys.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey game.
Automobile is a good team.
It's clear from the tournament table that the team is playing the right game.
Good hockey, good atmosphere in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them good luck.
The command is moving in the right direction.
Lots of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalie.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
They knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but it didn't work out."

According to the Spokesman, the current referendum addresses the issue of the country’s renaming, and nothing more, while the party’s strategic goal is to gain membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, President George Ivanov of Macedonia refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen a name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considered the renaming of the country to be a negative factor.
“A new semi-sovereign State is being established with a new name”, noted Ivanov.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic, the Republic of Northern Macedonia, was signed by the Heads of the Macedonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Greece on 17 June this year at a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespá, which runs the border between the two countries.
This treaty should resolve the multi-year dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje's journey to NATO and the EU, is similar to the TASS.

The US is setting up an increase in the production of opiates in Afghanistan
The sharp deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September has been extensively reported in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrouchev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, the militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the State authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has been a record year in the number of bloody terrorist attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” said Patrouchev.
Afghanistan's troubles didn't start yesterday.
Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Al-Qaida terrorist group (prohibited in the Russian Federation) was declared the main enemy of the United States.
Within a month, America and NATO allies began a military operation there, "The Endless Freedom."
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of United States troops are now on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more ghostous than it was then.
The American troops have been pushed behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
How can they get paid off by the militants for money so they don't get touched?
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40 per cent, according to Patrouchev.
50 per cent in the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
10 per cent more for ISIL terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they grow up there fast.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-khaliphate in Central Asia, exactly what they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be okay with that.
The production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times over the 17 years of the American presence.
The vast growth of the area planted with opium poppy and multi-billion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in the EU and NATO accession referendum, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the outcome of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia, seeing in that name an attempt on a Greek province and history of the same name.
Lupko Petkovsky, politicologist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is entitled to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will secure the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone very happy.”
The renaming of the country is advocated by the ruling social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Conservative opposition and President George Ivanov are against it.
According to the journalist Clementin Chilimanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, led by Zayev, is being imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice made by Macedonian citizens will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole.”
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs predicted a course of 17 years ahead of the ruble.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia is looking forward to a gradual depreciation of the rouble, up to 73.9 roubles per dollar by 2031-2035, as follows from the draft long-term budget forecast submitted to the State Duma together with the federal budget project.
In 2021-2025, the rate of ruble is projected to be 66.4 roubles per dollar, 71.1 roubles in 2026-2030 and 73.9 roubles in the next five years.
The Agency notes that these figures are nominal.
The real effective course (an indicator that takes into account the exchange rate movements of the major trading partners of the Russian Federation) will remain stable, as assured by officials.
In terms of inflation, it will be 3.5 per cent before 2020 and then stabilize at about 4 per cent, estimated in the Ministry of Finance.
