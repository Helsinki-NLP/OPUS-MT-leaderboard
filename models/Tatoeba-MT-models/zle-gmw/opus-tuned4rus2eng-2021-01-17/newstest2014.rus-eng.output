In Kineshma and the area, two men committed suicide.
Previously, one of the hangers had already attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1:00, a man born in the village of Lugovoy, born in 1947, committed suicide by hanging.
He was known to have attempted suicide before.
Which prompted a man to take such a step, I don't know.
On October 31, 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, took his life by hanging.
No signs of violent death have been found, reports the Ministry of Internal Affairs press service “Kineshimsky”.
Is there a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the splintering highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box carefully installed on the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile passing and transmit this information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the old American highway financing system by the planning bodies of Washington and the state.
Usually, the boring arena of motorway planning has suddenly generated intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to use small boxes to track the number of miles you pass, and perhaps even where you pass them, and then to use this information in the compilation of tax accounts.
The tea party is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
Although Congress is not yet in a position to agree on whether or not to proceed, several states are not going to wait.
They are considering how to move to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of the road they pass in the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“This is not a matter on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ihrata, Executive Director of the Southern California Association of Governments, who is preparing plans to begin tracking the state’s miles passing every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's already technology for that.
This is compounded by the lack of funding from the Government ' s Roads Fund, financed by taxes paid by Americans on gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as they used to.
Cars travel more than a mile a gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't risen in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high petrol prices.
“The fuel tax is simply impossible to keep,” said Lee Mannick, an expert in transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his staff, 500 tracking devices had recently been installed to test the pay-as-you-go system.
“It will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
Nerds call it the wrong user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are looking at the system in the development of strategies to meet the targets set by the state ' s ambitious global warming laws.
However, House Member Bill Schuester (Republican, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House, said that he also considered the system the most viable long-term alternative.
Free marketers in the Reason Foundation are also thrilled to make drivers pay for every mile.
“This is not just a tax that will go to a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Political Affairs, Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called for Congress to move towards a margin of error.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, involving about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of the fear of rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The most enthusiastic is in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers are about to pay the state a mile instead of a gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It's under review in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the involvement of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of the 17 states of the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the Government could monitor every move.
“Anxiety about the big brother and such things is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, the head of strategy and efficiency management in the Nevada Transport Department.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were well under way, the American Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the few states in which a difficult search for low-cost technology is under way that would allow the state authorities to keep track of miles passing by, but without information about place and time.
If you can do that, Han said, society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called True Milage.
Initially, this company did not cooperate in the collection of state taxes.
She sought to enter the developing market as a type of motor insurance, in which drivers pay on a mileage basis.
But the devices she's testing attract road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded by modem.
“People will be more inclined to do so if you do not track their speed and location,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director True Mileage.
There were several major mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with different options for drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can give up the device completely by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles all the people of the state are passing.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea to a cautious public, forcing devices to do more than less.
In New York City, transport officials seek to develop a tax scheme that will also accept parking counter fees, provide “pays as you drive” insurance, and collect a real-time speed data pool from other drivers who could use to avoid traffic.
“Vehicles will attract the benefits that will be offered to them”, states the urban design document.
Some transport designers, however, wonder whether all talk of false payment is simply a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay City Transport Commission, officials say that Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Highways by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the law and public relations commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU is preparing support measures for Ukraine in the event of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a back-up plan for the supply of gas to Ukraine, as well as an agreement with IMF on emergency credit, should Russia take any action in response to a possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
A stand-by loan is being negotiated with IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim is to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to potential IMF lending, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the EU itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing disagreements about funding conditions.
He does not believe in the possibility of the reforms needed to receive aid, nor does the international rating agency S&P, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step on Friday, to a "B-" with a "B."
However, the EU representatives say that the IMF can show flexibility in the lending environment, taking into account Ukraine’s circumstances.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a stand-by option to supply Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which is now coming from Russia.
Maybe it's going to be a Northflow gas or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most feasible and acceptable way if Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such a method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used within a few weeks and will likely lead to a reduction in supplies to other regions.
“There are negotiations between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but from other routes”, the source added.
Russia outside the campaign for urban pollution by car
Attempts to address the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most mega-cities since the second half of the twentieth century.
Typically, they were either re-engineered and extended roads, or attempts to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of vehicles and the time they were used.
There is a well-known example of Singapore, which introduces strict quotas for the growth of private cars and buys them in auctions.
Its price may be two to three times that of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have imposed entry fees on the city centre.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green areas are introduced, allowing only vehicles with a certain eco-class that also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Environmental Protection Agency of Beijing, for example, approved in 2012 a “five-year clean air plan” worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to OS, the director of the Transport Pollution Control Department of the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau of Beijing Lee Kunscheng, the main goal of the five-year-old is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (now 5.2 million), and to increase the use of fuel per vehicle by no more than 5%.
According to the agency, vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme are to restrict the use of road transport, as well as to impose additional taxes on motorowners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the “green five-year” include the accelerated transition from the rest of the country to Euro-standards, the introduction of local eco-standards and car and fuel labels, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the prohibition of the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programmes to replace old vehicles with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric vehicles (including public and service vehicles), and the development of public transport (including high-speed vehicles).
Peking's automotive innovations also include the ban on all private cars to travel within the fifth transport ring (in all six in the capital of the PRC) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle license plate) and the issuance of lottery-based car registration plates (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of private car registration permits in Beijing was only one third of the number in 2010).
According to the current government programme “Environment 2012-2020”, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, 41 per cent of all urban air pollutants were released from “moving sources” in 2011.
In Moscow, for example, car emissions are ten times higher than industrial emissions and in St. Petersburg nine times higher.
The Russian Federation is still only beginning to reflect on the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy, considers that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are notoriously unpopular and can only be adopted by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, with two clusters that are not sensitive to any regulatory effects - office and personal vehicles, as well as vehicles of “privileged” users, with a total of at least 200,000 (about 5 per cent of the total of Moscow vehicles).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study analysing the balance of urban areas between housing, road surfaces and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of researchers are that the city centre is provided with half the required roads, and most motorists in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods of time in parking or simply on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build car vaults rather than to expand, rather than to reduce the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and location of personal transport within the area of the security area of the historic centre (a total area of about 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will increase.
According to city authorities, an increase in fines would help to clean up Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
The majority of street traders do not pay taxes, the products they make are often not subject to appropriate sanitary controls.
Which means the health of the wetlands is at risk.
For example, the lower limit of the fine for unauthorized trade for citizens will rise sixfold from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles from November, as reported by the press service of the Vologda administration.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment for unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of that growth.
In recent times, it is entirely due to consumption, which is almost non-reducing,” said the Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs for Russia, Clemens Grate, presenting yesterday’s quarterly investment report on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal increase in wages in Russia is about 10%.
With 6% inflation, it will be able to generate future consumer demand at about the current level, waiting for Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so it is likely that they will focus on optimizing staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages rise by 10 per cent, GDP by only 2 per cent, Mr. Grafé explained.
Companies faced reduced profitability.
If it does not grow up, it may lead to dismissals and increased unemployment.
Russian businesses cannot raise their wages, commenting by the chief economist Barclays Capital on Russia and CIS, Vladimir Pantushin.
Unemployment is close to historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise salaries to lure out or retain current employees.
Consumption in Russia is also living with a very rapid increase in the demand for credit.
According to Mr. Grafé, because of the very high consumer borrowing rates, this type of credit does not have a multiplier effect on the economy.
"The benefits to the economy from increased consumerisation have not been seen, money does not diverge in the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments," said the economist.
But the problem is that Goldman Sachs is waiting for an increase in unfunded loans.
They're mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide for.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more often,” Mr. Grafé noted.
The second threat to the growth of Russia’s economy is therefore a possible non-payment crisis for unsecured loans.
Vasily Solodkov, director of the World Banking Institute, is already seeing signs of an impending banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to State banks, have been forced to attract high-interest public funds.
In response, the State Banks went on the path of war and began to lower their lending rates, and the economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot lend to the same interest, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the State Banks do not give up dumping, Russia faces a full-blown banking crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes.
The economist considers the withdrawal of licences from a number of banks in recent weeks to be a harbinger of mass collapse.
“The state's own banks will fail to deal with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis”, warns the head of the institute.
But the increase in consumption will slow down, and without a crisis of non-payments, it is believed in the investment bank, because of the failure to index the salaries of civil servants and the military, as laid down in the current version of the budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by lower inflation).
But only partly: if the investment does not increase (and the prerequisites are not yet available - see the certificate), the increase in consumption will still slow down, confident of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for implementing pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a fall in the price of oil," he says.
He estimates that Russia's economy will begin to decline at a cost below $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB is not yet able to lower interest rates in the economy.
A paradoxical picture is that inflation has fallen and banks have begun to raise their stakes.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB that announced the transition to inflation,” said Clemens Graf.
The interest policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, but only inter-bank lending rates.
"For the CB, it's the collapse of all hopes," Clements Counte.
The money obtained at CB auctions is not used by banks to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
Once the rate drops, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go into speculation against the ruble.
“Either way, the CB will realize that this strategy is not working,” Mr. Grafé said, and recalled that the State is planning to put a ruble on “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But either we have to do it sooner or we have to raise the key rate of the CB (5%), he thinks.
According to his estimate, the ruble course is now artificially overstated by 10%.
There's only one way to weaken, the expert concludes.
But if the CB drops a shadow of doubt in the financiers that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the ruble, it could bring down the ruble much more.
The second South Ural Congress was held in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum will mark the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and regions of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies, a total of some 350 persons.
The forum ' s course is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
We can set an example here, not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences or differences.
We live in full agreement," claims Feofan, the Mitropolitan of Chelabinsky and Zlatoustovsky.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the education of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
At the end of the Congress, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
An exhibition of ethnic and cultural associations in the Chelyabin region was opened.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on a U.S. intelligence issue.
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence exposer, stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about his activities.
German deputy Hans-Christian Strebele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, who was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, stated: “Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to view dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that do not provide any protection.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. Government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense following allegations that the NSA was tapping the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who chairs a parliamentary intelligence team, said that if there is an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness “without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the U.S. completely”, it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, MP of the Party of Green Germany, published his photo with Mr. Snowden on Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there “in safety”, said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a “hard and continuous” campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the global response to “his political statements”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high - ranking officials — including in the United States — found the discovery of an uncontrollable surveillance system beneficial to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge for manual storage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge the passengers up to $100 for carrying a handful on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a hand-held storage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday was that passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand-deposit charges apply to bags in the upper baggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said she'd be charging $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travelers would only pay when they landed.
Frontier's representative Kate O'Malley said that a $100 fee should make the passengers take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for this," she said.
The airlines started charging for the first and second bag in their luggage in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these charges fill as much as they can into a hand-held storage unit placed in the upper baggage compartments, which often lacks space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really about making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier clients claim that finding a place in the upper baggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website don't have to pay.
This means that one passenger in a queue outside the Frontier flight can be allowed to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing the procedures on the website and on the Frantier registration staircases is meant to ensure that passengers will know about the collection before they get to the landing.
The new Frontier charge for the handheld will not start before summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need it must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges to be a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, most of them did not refer to hand-deposit charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual storage fee three years ago, and another Allegiant Air Discounter later followed her example.
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the extra charges.
According to his December 2011 report, the manual deposit fee is $50 million a year.
Sorensen, former top manager of Midwest Airlines, had recently flown on the Spirit flight, and he wondered what he would find at the entrance to the landing when passengers faced an unusual collection of Spirit by hand.
“The landing process was the smoothest I've ever seen in my airline career,” he said.
I was expecting to see the teeth crunch and a fight at the entrance to the landing.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went fast."
Frontier is also followed by Spirit for a fee of $2 for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who received soda or juice could keep the entire can and that the coffee spill would be provided free of charge.
She's still giving out free water.
US Airways tried to charge for drinks for a short time in 2008, but refused to do so seven months after the passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed her example.
The Frontier initiative to charge for hand-deposits when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its last effort to attract customers to its website.
Air companies pay online tickets like Orbitz from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than go to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went beyond everyone in this area.
In September, she started giving half the bonus miles of a frequent flyer to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the bonus number of miles to 25 percent of the miles.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from the Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would make it possible to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose a place in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal client base in her hometown, Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming a loss.
The revenue fell by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities fell by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix the Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
NSA blames "internal error," not hackers for shutting down the site.
The covert National Security Agency announced on Friday night that the termination of their site for a few hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as alleged on the network.
“NSA.gov was not available for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that occurred during the planned renewal”, the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the interruption was caused by a distributed “default” [DDoS] attack were incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA site was not working for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
A representative of the NSA had previously told ABC News that the agency's internal secret network had been hacked “not at all”.
No classified information is in danger, the representative reported.
At least one online hacker group claimed that it was responsible for decommissioning the NSA site with a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to fill the target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
Hackers' tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to infiltrate the target system's internal network.
The previously super-secret NSA, once named "No such Agency", has been at the centre of public attention and criticism in recent months, following a series of reports of its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and domestically, all of which are reactions to NSA secret files stolen from the agency and published by a disillusioned former NSA employee, Edward Snowden.
The growing debate around the agency has led to the perception that today's incident was the result of targeted action by hackers.
Bombardier's profits are declining with the drop in supplies and the number of aircraft orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday due to the reduced number of aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
Neither did Bombardier, a company based in Montreal, publish any data on the flight tests of its latest CSeries aircraft, nor provide new information on whether ambitious plans for commercialization of the aircraft would be implemented by the next September.
After the first flight of a prototype aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, raising questions as to whether the test was on schedule.
The results did not meet the projections and resulted in a fall of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst of the National Bank Financial, reduced his estimate on Thursday from “higher-market” to “medium-market” because of the belief that stock growth was limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in the quantity of aircraft was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the performance of the transport division,” said Doerksen in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new CSeries orders as the flight test program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to take a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot aircraft was presented in March and flew for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, the CSeries orders are not yet too many, 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to verify the company's allegations of fuel efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness of the new ship.
A total of 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators are now in place.
The Chief Executive Officer, Pierre Boduan, was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft was launched for commercial use.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward.
“The pilot model did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Boduan said during the telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software upgrades had been planned for the duration of the plane’s stay.
All manufacturers plan the tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break on the renewals, and that's what we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test programme.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks, and the rest will follow soon, according to the company.
Still, analysts are sceptical about the claim that the first client will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it was assessing the date of commissioning and would provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight testing, although likely in line with Bombardier's internal schedule, supports our view that entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, which ended on 30 September, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents a share, from $172 million, or 9 cents a share, last year.
The adjusted return for the share remained the same at 9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world reported having delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, which is less than the previous year ' s figure of 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26.
The Air Space Division order portfolio was $32.9 billion as of September 30, without change since December 31.
“In the aerospace area, the results were consistent with our objectives, but the low number of orders received and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor”, said Boduan.
The gross income on the aerospace track fell by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that gross revenue in this sector increased by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit was $32.6 billion as at 30 September, slightly higher than on 31 December.
The revenues of the transport unit have been adversely affected by the problems of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be submitted in the fourth quarter.
The stock of Bombardier, which also announced that the CEO of Google Corporation, Patrick Peachett, would join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent, to C$4.83, at a bid in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest rival Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony's counting on lower annual profits.
The Japanese electronics producer Sony, after completing the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
The Sony results from July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected, owing to a decline in demand for television, video cameras and Japanese corporate personal computers.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company's first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell back to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese market for consumer electronics is going through difficult times, especially because of the decline in demand for television.
And while competitors try to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially through car systems and clean technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to earn 179 billion yen of operating profits against the expected earlier 230 billion yen.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts estimated that the figure would be significantly higher to 221 billion yen.
Sony expands the food line in an effort to get out of the crisis.
In the middle of this month, sales of smart watches were announced from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashionable functions that would eliminate the need to remove a smartphone from its pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered the annual profit and profit forecast, the company's shares lost more than 11% at the opening of torogs in Tokyo in the morning, falling to a level of 1668 yen per action.
The gene of speech turned out to be a stimulant for the formation of synapses.
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School found a protein that enabled the "gen speech" Foxp2 to play its role in stimulating the formation of new neuron connections.
The study is published in Science and can be read briefly on the magazine's website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a family of several people who could not speak correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists found that the Foxp2 gene had been disrupted by family members, but how it performed its function was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their functions is Foxp2 as an incentive for the formation of new synapses in the brain-related speech.
It does this because of another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2 shining for its activity.
What SRPX2 really affects vocalization has been confirmed by scientists in an experiment on mice.
When animals were artificially reduced in their gene activity, they screamed less when they were separated from their mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the sound produced was restored.
Previously, the mice also showed a connection to the vocalization of Foxp2.
Animals who were injected with a human copy of the gene were eating more and more at a lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and therefore its SRPX2 is linked to the purely “mechanical” properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
A cocaine lawyer who warned the head of the criminal gang about a police investigation is imprisoned.
42-year-old Basarat Diett was passing information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough.
Counsel was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be solved.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer, who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid to expose his secret drug addiction, was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basarat Diett was passing secret information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough on the investigation into his drug trafficking activities after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bash, who was called a “cool lawyer” among the criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation for Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
The officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn County, Lancashire, while he was at a bar association dinner with his colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Dietta was "regulously using" a Class A drug after the tests showed signs of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
During the eight-month period from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two persons on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at that time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Merciside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police seized in a series of raids of heroin and cocaine valued at £1.5 million and over £200,000 in cash.
42-year-old Dietta was passing information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court of Diett, who works for the Forbes Solicitors Legal Company in Blackburn, was disgraced after he was found guilty in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial in the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer was exposed after the police investigating Scarborough found out that he had regularly spoken to Diet on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and found him walking up to Diet's house in Blackburn and putting 60 percent clean drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer's dumpster.
Shortly after the release of Scarborough, he contacted Deetta, who was at dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court learned that Diett was “regulously using” cocaine after the tests found traces of a Class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Dietta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication constituted a “lawyer's secret”.
During his detention, Diet took his wallet and attempted to remove several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said that, along with the workplace, he had a home office and clients came to his house on legal matters.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he had called the largest drug traffickers, a number of whom he had previously represented in court to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
In an indictment speech, Ann White said, "If anyone knows they shouldn't break the law, it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dietta is charged with abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer because he has had too close relations with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations would certainly prove legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the normal relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dietta did not honor his profession, but humiliated her.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, to question his interest.
Dietta did not confess guilt and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I would like to convey information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police stated: “Mr. Dietta turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal as soon as he began to buy drugs from organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine had made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to key criminal gang members, who had instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Dietta betrayed that trust and tried to cover his profession.
The investigation of Mr. Diet was led by the Sri Lankashire unit for particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage and now to obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve fair punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was convicted 14 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
An additional 35 persons involved in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related offences.
On his website, Dietta organized a question-and-answer conversation, in which he said that his dream work was a lawyer representing American death row clients, the perfect companion for him at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and motivation for his work was inequality.
The Stadium in Yaroslavla was not ready for 22,000 viewers, and police officers who were present at the meeting of the Russian Federation ' s CDC today noted.
The ticket programme is, in their view, about twice as high.
During the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup with Spartacus, only 1,000 stewards were engaged, with a standard of 9,000.
Spartakov’s fans had 2,200 seats, 10 per cent of the stadium’s capacity, but, in agreement with the Moscow Club, they had sold 5,000 tickets.
This information has been read by the head of the KDC, Arthur Grigoriantz.
Americans eavesdropped Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the United States security services, who chose not to reveal his name, said that the States had overheard telephone calls from high-ranking Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that there are several listening points in the country of rising sun.
He noted, however, that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States did not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
This, he said, occurred during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with Americans in the post-war period, is a target for intelligence activities, and NHK reported.
None of the parties has officially commented on this information.
Let's remind you that news about US intelligence surveillance on the German chancellor last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA could have tapped Merkel's phone for the last 10 years.
The Chancellor himself, according to some reports, took the news of her wire very painfully.
She stated that the allies she believed were the Germans and the US for decades, such surveillance of the head of government was unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden stated that he was prepared to share details about the wiretaps of Angela Merkel's phone calls with the German prosecutor's office.
The German specifically flew to Moscow to meet a former CIA employee.
Bashkiria can put the grain on the market not before early 2014.
Bashkiria, in the course of government procurement interventions, may put grain on the market at the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic, Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales to the intervention fund.
So far, the market price is higher, and demand is.
"Maybe the grain will be tendered after New Year's," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, crop crops for the 2013 crop amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including 1.7 million hectares of cereals, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
For the 2014 harvest, 550,000 hectares were planted (105,000 hectares more than in 2012).
The area under winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and the face has remained at the same level.
There's no Brothers' Circle in the MVD bases, which Leps in the U.S.
The databases of the Russian silos of the Bratsky Circle, to which Washington listed singer Gregory Leps, are not listed.
According to Interfax, in the Russian Federation's law enforcement agencies, after reports of the United States Treasury Department's placing Gregory Leps on the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate “Brath Circle”, all databases were checked, but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called “Russian Mafia”, which allegedly operates abroad, is considered by the security forces.
"Even in the very name, the 'brother', there's some element of mystery, a hint of a secret bed.
"It's all very similar to a PR action," said the agency's interlocutor.
On October 31, the U.S. Department of Finance announced that it had placed Arthur Badalian, Gregory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lilin, Sergey Moskalenko, Jacob Rybalsky and Igor Schlykov, on its control lists, on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate.
The individuals on the list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontier and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered to be powerful members of criminal groups and have been on the US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Gregory Leps is "a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
At the production center of Gregory Leps, they refused to comment on the US charges against the singer, calling them "single."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama identified the Brotherhood Syndicate as a “substantial transnational organized criminal group” and instructed the MCPU to “sabote and prevent their global criminal operations.”
Putting a person on blacklists in the U.S. Minfine involves blocking his assets in the U.S. and prohibiting business contacts with him by people living in the U.S.
Scandal video hit the police.
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and blatantly reckless behavior, was caught smoking crack.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had a video record and were ready to launch an investigation against the town commander.
He stated that he would not leave his post, reports to CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's drug use appeared on the Toronto Police website.
The head of the local law enforcement agencies, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the data with the public, but he was vouchsafed for their existence.
According to Blair, Rob Ford's compromising video was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by the guards in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had previously written about the existence of the video, but until recently there had been no evidence of it.
The mayor himself is not commenting on this.
He's just saying it's not his fault, and he's not going to resign.
The police video is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend, Ford Alexander Licey, accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal proceeds, and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lisa was the driver of Rob Ford.
The city's residents have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He fought with journalists on several occasions, appeared in public drunk, and allowed himself racist and sexist speech.
The UAO Rostovaeroinvest recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender chosen by the designer of the object.
The sum of the contract at Rostavaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the UAO press service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and the tender was to be prepared and sent to the State Expertise in the spring of 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure, internal roads and airport facility upgrades.
In the first phase of construction, the interior area of the terminal will be 50,000 square metres, and may be increased thereafter.
According to Rostavaeroinvest, the project documents will take into account the prospects for the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was finalized, the architectural concept of the South Aeronautical Complex was defined and developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities in the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in major projects, the company has designed terminals C and E of Sheremetevo International Airport and a new aeronautical complex at Knivici International Airport in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport Complex will be built in the Aksai region of Rostov oblast and will replace the existing growth of the South Airport, which will be closed down and eventually integrated into urban development.
The construction of the aeronautical facility is scheduled to begin in 2014, and the installation of all facilities is scheduled for 2017.
A politician in Turkey launched a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria.
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of the separation wall in the area of Nusaibin in south-east Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the procuradian party of the MUP strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Ayshe Gekhan, on the border with Syria, launched a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, informed RIA Newsy in the Press Service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMP) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly dispersed protests.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muammer Güler, first denied the construction, then stated that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
“Mair Nusaibina Ayshe Gekhan, a member of the MMA, has taken a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the wall into a deadly struggle”, stated the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, and the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhumane situation with which the Kurds will never agree”, quotes Ayshe Gekhan from the party.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nusaibin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set the exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela would introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the bolívara, against the tourist dollar.
This was reported by Bloomberg on 1 November, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand United States dollars in a year.
Venezuela would also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the Bolivians purchased in the country at the time of their departure.
The specific course of the bolivar against the dollar will be established at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
In the black market, however, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, Venezuela had almost 50 per cent inflation.
The Minister of Oil and the Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, stated on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalue bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas could still decide to lower the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of containing prices for products and goods of general consumption, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a shortage of goods and to the functioning of the black exchange market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
The director of the Surrae, Andrey Belmach, noted that it is still difficult to tell how long it will take to find a new chief coach.
This post became vacant after Sergey Shepelev resigned.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to tell you how long it's gonna take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, I'm saying Belmach's word to the ITAR-TASS.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find some coach, but a guy who's been working at our club for years and getting some results with him.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask, ‘What can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?’, reported the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, a parent company called CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new media judiciary “will always be biased, as it is a continuation of government”, and limiting content and advertising would be detrimental to Kenya's global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the government to “make the media a dead grip,” while The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “had a serious blow,” and criticized the bill as “drakonical.”
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate mall.
The Kenyan media provoked the authorities' anger by broadcasting surveillance videos, where troops who had been sent to the scene of the attack allegedly robbed a expensive mall.
David Kimayo, the Chief of Police, responded by calling two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled following mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists can be fined up to one million, with an additional risk of being “de-listed”, i.e. being banned from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyse most FM radio stations.”
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called live blogosphere.
Politicians realize that by keeping the media quiet, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote a journalist named Nation Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of deterrent and balancing forces in public life.
“The politicians themselves will ruin the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the cuts appointed by the National Wages Commission and to restore their huge salary, which amounts to approximately 532,000 shillings per month without tax, one of the highest in the world.
A new cost line, the major maintenance of the house, will appear in the payment of the citizens' utilities.
The most approximate estimate for a standard two-bedroom flat is that from the new year, 100 to 400 roubles per month will have to be added.
The exact regulation will be determined by the Government of the region.
But when you paint the entrance, fix the staircases, or even replace the elevator, it's up to the tenants to decide.
This law was approved by the deputies of the Regional Duma.
Vladimir Krysnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: “In this case, too, it is necessary to establish order - to prioritize the renovation of houses, to collect funds from companies other than managers - which are often registered with us in Moscow, in Orenburg, or elsewhere, it will be the establishment of State control over the expenditure of funds collected by residents to repair multi-family houses.”
State-controlled construction is now also a shareholder.
A law that protects against cons has been approved by cunning in final reading.
The document wasn't born empty.
In our region, 4,500 people have been affected by dishonest developers.
The problems of the majority have been resolved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in the construction.
Vladimir Krysnikov, president of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said, "It is no secret that abuses have also begun in this field, due to the fact that, in the '98, the same donors fell, and in the '2000s, the same contributors."
People began to earn money to cover the loophole, including the passage of these two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation.
The Regional Parliament had adopted such a law not only under pressure from the Federation.
The problems of irregular migrants in the region are even more acute.
In the past year, for example, a little more than 100,000 foreigners have been registered for migration.
But only one out of five issued a formal work permit.
Where the others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Krysnikov, president of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said, "They broke the law, but they are not criminals."
There's no court, and you have to deport them. You have to keep them somewhere.
The Federation decided that regional funds would provide such facilities.
In the Voronezhsk oblast, this is the Old Olshanka of the Semiluk district.
And lastly, the regional parliament granted new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families with 5 or more children are completely exempt from transport taxes.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million, but many parents save the same amount.
Second, and most importantly, those who adopt three or more babies will be granted housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
A family of 6 people, for example, is the father, the mother, the birth child and the third adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State purchases 108 square metres of housing for 3,300,000 roubles.
For the left bank or the southwest neighbourhood, it is a viable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the Rice Center for that.
Baumgertner has been nominated to the board of directors of Uralkalia.
The current UAO Board of Directors, Uralkalius, has nominated Director Vladislav Baumgertner, arrested in Minsk, for the new board, and is available on the Russian company's website.
Bamughertner is on the list of 11 persons nominated to the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for the Extraordinary Shareholder Meeting on 29 November, which will determine the new composition of the Board of Directors by vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
When he was arrested in August this year, he was charged with abuse of official authority.
However, later, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, at a press conference, stated that the charges against Baumgertner were classified as “theft”.
Petroleum Gatekeeper Matt Dalton refused to comment on Vladimir Krikunov's departure as a mentor for the Lower Mentor.
Golkiper believes that Acting Chief Coach Dmitri Balmin has great authority over the players and will carry out his duties.
Let's remind you, today, the Petroleum Chemist resigned Creekunov.
To be honest, I don't want to comment on Vladimir Krikunov's dismissal, quotes Dalton RIA "News".
I can only say that Dmitri Balmin will live up to his responsibilities - I have no doubt about that.
He's got a lot of authority on the team, and this young professional is definitely looking forward to a great future.
The advocate of Juventus, Leonardo Bonucci, will not help the team in the nearest Italian championship match with Parma.
According to Fotball Italy, the coach's staff decided not to include it in the game's application to save it before the 4th round of the Champions League with the Real.
Nor will they compete with the Parma of Lichtsteiner, Vucinić and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Quillarella recovered from the trauma and was ready to play.
The fuel will be driven by a tax manoeuvre, which involves an increase in the mineral tax (DDI) on oil at the same time as a reduction in export duties and an increase in excise.
Experts suggested that these measures could add an additional 619.3 billion roubles to the budget.
The president of the Krasnoyar court stole his ID and hit him on the head.
Unknown persons attacked the President of the Krasnoyar District Court, Vladimir Dwokonko, stealing his identity card.
According to Interfax, late on Wednesday night, the intruders hit the judge in the head, causing him to faint.
When the 63-year-old president came to his senses, he discovered that he had been removed from his office.
Money and other values have not been taken by criminals.
He made his own way home, and the next day he contacted the police.
A crime investigation and a search for criminals are under way.
"Zenita" patients on the club's official website recognized the Russian ex-captain as the best player in the past month.
In October, Arshavin participated in two group matches of the UEFA League of Champions, three meetings of the Russian championship, and a Cup match.

In Ivanov, the VII interregional exhibit “Medicine and Health” was opened.
The interregional exhibition “Medicine and Health 2013” was opened at the Olympic Sports and Entertainment Complex.
The First Vice-President of the Government of the Ivanovsky Region, Olga Hasbulatov, took part in the opening event.
The exhibition presents the work of the regional health-care institutions of Ivanov oblast as well as commercial health-care institutions in the regions of Central Russia.
The exhibition will include seminars, round tables, presentations.
During the exhibition, a mobile complex (complete diagnostic), a mobile fluorographer and a blood transfusion station are organized.
All interested will be able to obtain free diagnostic procedures, specialist advice, participation in the master class in physical medicine and the range of services provided in the Ivanovsk region.
In addition, the exhibit includes donor day.
The general concept of the exhibit “Medicine and Health 2013” is a preventive direction in medicine and the promotion of healthy lifestyles.
The exhibit includes medical goods and services, equipment, pharmaceuticals and medicines that improve the quality of life.
The main directions of the exhibition were: the development of cooperation with manufacturers and suppliers of medical equipment in the Ivanovsk region and the regions of Russia; the demonstration of medical goods and services, equipment, pharmaceuticals and medicines that improve the quality of life; and the establishment of business contacts between medical institutions in the Ivanovsk region.
U.S. Secretary of State: Special Services have sometimes gone too far in data collection.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that in collecting data and listening, United States intelligence agencies sometimes went too far, but the politician pointed out that 70 million people had been misled by the media.
I assure you that innocent people have not been harmed in this process, but there has been an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases this has gone too far and was wrong.
I recognize this, as the President also admits... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future,” quotes Secretary of State AFP.
Italian workers with seniority give way to young people
Italian unemployment beats the record.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s population is now unemployed.
This has not been the case since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4 per cent of the population aged 15-24 is unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, the early retirement of older workers is one solution to this problem.
The largest energy company in the country is already implementing such an experiment, and the laws that have been enacted allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for long-term workers.
On the other hand, Italy is looking forward to a common problem for Europe with the ageing population.
And economists are not sure that a premature staff rotation will justify itself.
The result of the construction of TIP in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to build more and more transport and transport hubs (TPNs).
It is planned that 255 TPNs will be operational by 2020.
What the project really does is our correspondent.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence broke out at the Smolenskaya subway of the Arbatsko-Porodskaya Line.
The inscription stated that the transport hub was being renovated.
This was all very strange, because there is no ground transport stopping near Smolenskaya, and therefore it is impossible to move on to it.
To reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, we must travel about 130 meters, including a land crossing through the Karmanica alley.
Smolensky's almost finished now.
A flower larec has disappeared, a newspaper stand has been dismantled, and the asphalt has been replaced by a bar bar before the entrance.
That's the whole transport knot.
Transport hubs are flat and capital, explained in the press service of the Metropolitan Department of Transport.
There are no capital TPs yet.
And the flat ones involve the construction of parking spaces, the removal of commercial objects that impede the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms, and improvements.
In fact, flat TIPs are not even dedicated to transporters, but to professional facilities from the capital maintenance department of Moscow City.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design, explains Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes a roof over your head and a placard are enough to tell you when the transport is arriving.
For example, the Yasenevo subway recently opened a fully-fledged flat transplant knot.
No curtains, but with interceptive parkings and placards indicating when the bus arrives.
But in the pursuit of numbers, officials record everything in TIP.
As early as 2011, the City Hall planned to build all 151 knots, of which 59 were capital-built.
Now there are as many as 255 TPs in the planning for 2020.
Of these, 1,500 are promised to be surrendered this year.
Although there is a TIP programme in the city, there are no qualitative criteria, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of City and Transport.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transplants on each of them is often deteriorating.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: first, reduced transplant time, secondly, convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without coming out in the rain.
In Moscow, however, TIPs are sometimes exactly the opposite.
A bright example of the U.N.A. subway.
Back in the day, suburban buses from the Yaroslavski highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the OCE.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka to the street of the Cosmonauts.
Far from the subway, far from the monorails, but closer to the apartments.
It is in vain that the residents did not want a bus station under the windows and complained to every possible authority.
With the capital TPs in Moscow, it didn't work out at once.
The first one started building five years ago at the Planetary subway.
The project was designed to be exemplary.
And indeed, there's been a pattern of how a transfer hub that's been repaid to investors turns into a banal shopping centre.
No, there's a bus fart, a curtain to keep the subway out of the rain, and three floors of parking.
It is true that chemical trolleybuses Nos. 202 and No. 203 were given no place in principle in Moscow's TIP.
They've been pushed away as strangers from the subway.
But there's more room left to trade.
It's only 32 stores, and there's almost all of them, from the zootovars to the car salon.
Well, really, what if any of the bus passengers need a new car on the road?
We always have a shopping center when we build a capital TP.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot decided to be placed on the market.
Now, on the third floor of the "Planerny" TIP, there's a slaughter trade among the parking spaces on the floor.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech, and guards who look angry at our photographer.
The transplant knot has finally turned into a bazaar.
The thing is, the Planetary subway used to have a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the merchants were spared and allowed into the interceptive parking lot of the transplant node.
Because of high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is, the market was demolished to build in its place... a new flat TP.
It's such a rock.
On the subway of Caliuzskaya, the distance from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 metres, says Alexander Morozov.
Since the construction of the mall, the distance has allegedly increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the mall.
After 22 hours when it's closed, you have to walk around it in the open.
However, the designs on the Planerna and the Kalyuzskaya will soon appear to be flowering.
In mid-September, the city and land commission of the city hall approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPNs.
Four of them will be 25-story, except for two or three subterranean longlines.
The main monster will grow up at the Tušino subway, and it will have 418.7 thousand square metres of square area.
The representatives of the railway station directorate of the RWC, who are responsible for the construction of TIPs by the subway, have already told journalists that future multi-storey facilities will include shops, hotels and apartments.
However, officials say that multi-layer parking is a third to half of the land area.
Take, for example, public garages.
Let's say that the 258-seater garage that was recently built on International Street has an area of 8,015 square metres.
So it's gonna take about 80,000 quadrats to park for 2,600 cars at Petrovsko-Rasumovskaya.
It's less than a third of the stuff they're going to build there.
Let one or two floors go to all the bus farrons.
At least 150,000 square metres of commercial real estate remain.
And this, for a minute, is almost two GUMs.
If the capital TIPs at stations and stations are built by railways, the rest of the sites will be developed by metropolitanians.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities", including hotels, offices, and even gyms.
By the way, the Moscow Department of Property recently told journalists that a draft decree was being drafted to allow investors to apply directly for a TIP site to officials.
No contests.
Because it's said that transport issues are a priority for the city.
The perfect TIP is, for example, the Garward stations in Boston or the Spade in Toronto, I'm sure Alexander Morozov.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend to the subway level and the distance from the subway to the tram is only 50 meters away from the street.
There's no extra trade around here.
But Moscow officials are thrown into extremes.
Either we don't build anything, or we're gonna blow up 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremism.
To legislate to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens against provocations and insults directed against Russia, Justice Russia proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to punish it for five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such legislative amendments prepared by the Deputy Duma Energy Committee, Oleg Miheev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the Government for an opinion.
By the patriotic sentiments of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand a person ' s emotional relationship with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for the country, responsibility for its destiny, respect for its history and culture.
As Miheev points out, domestic legislation has sanctions for abuse of the formal characteristics of State authority, the flag and the emblem.
In the opinion of the parliamentarian, however, the protection of Russians whose feelings may be hurt and insulted by State symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country is not sufficiently developed in Russian legislation.
He cites as an example the debate that unfolds every year on the eve of Victory Day, when some mediamen allow themselves to question the heroic performance of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday, the 9th of May, a real vachanalia is launched every year.
By practising the wits and the "alternative" view of history, some publicists have come to the thought that it is a shame that the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I find this totally unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the nation's main “spiritual crutch”, Oleg Miheev resents.
In addition, according to Miheev, there are far more patriotic people in Russia than religious ones, but the law punishes insults to the feelings of believers, while insulting patriotic feelings can be done with virtually impunity.
In the opinion of the People ' s Elector, it is necessary to equate insults of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to prescribe appropriate penalties in article 282 of the Penal Code.
The bill provides for the punishment of insulting patriotic feelings, ranging from a fine of 100,000 to 5 years ' imprisonment.
An earthquake of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the area of Cokimbo in central Chile, and is transmitted by Reuters.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometres and 54 kilometres southwest of the city, as explained on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
Pushes were recorded at 8:03 local time (3:03-1 November Moscow).
No casualties or destruction caused by underground shocks have yet been reported.
Let us recall that Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the earth, so earthquakes are not uncommon.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
At that time, an 8.8 - magnetic earthquake and its tsunami caused the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
Chile also experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history, with 9.5 recorded in 1960.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of that disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: The Greenpeace case will be heard fairly
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, announced on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be dealt with in strict compliance with Russian law.
France can be certain that the case will be handled in accordance with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, like other activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quotes Mr. Ero's RIA News.
“Our country cannot support activities that may harm the environment, nor can anyone violate the law”, Dmitry Medvedev said.
He said that the activities of any structures that tried to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy extraction, were dangerous.
He stressed that these facilities were “as a gunpowder barrel” and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, transmitting RIA News.
UN Declares New Goals for Poverty Alleviation
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 MDGs before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio the night before.
They were included in the outcome document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit the evening before that the time had come to “take precedence over national interests”.
“I am glad that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and take control of the universal sustainable development goals — the SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the authority vested in me by member countries to translate our vision of the sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Concerns about security in Mozambique have increased as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the top-down statue of Zamora Machel, the founding President of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant peace slogans at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sussa, executive director of an investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed the business costume to a shirt that was painted with the words “We demand security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Metropolitan Independence Square.
Over two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between Government forces and Renamo, one of the most violent clashes since the truce more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement supported first by the White authorities of Rhodesia and then by the South African Government of the apartheid era in an effort to destabilize the country ' s independent Government.
After the truce in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to relapse into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
The stakes are high for a rapidly growing economy, as the discovery of huge shelf reserves of gas and coal deposits in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion in investments over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party have accused each other of the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government was the instigator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, the traditional fence of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times by Fernando Mazanga, a representative of Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of assaulting soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to dispel fears of instability.
Hebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday, that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a “successful man” who wanted to use “all that was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government.”
Both Frellimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased following reports that Mazanga had declared Renamo ' s rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He informed the Financial Times that he had in mind the non-compliance with the agreement by the Frelimo party.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tension that has been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential men (Gebuza and Dhlakama) who ran into their foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert in Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and neither is willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
Renamo’s vote has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), founded by former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza, who was due to resign next year, when his second term ended, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace, because he doesn't want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not clear what capacity Renamo has, but it has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key motorway from north to south.
Most of the fighting took place in Sofala Province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked whether Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo Party wanted “to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased government discontent, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of an independent media company, Mediacoop.
“People think that the Government and the President are responsible for the future of the country, who must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultan, a protester, said that people just wanted stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to roads,” he said.
The Arth Mainstre premiere series will be held in Moscow.
A series of "Art Mainstre" films, where the audience will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they are released, will be held at the Rolan cinema from 1 to 5 November, reporting to RIA "News" with reference to the project's organizers.
Opens the Art Mainstry program by the French director's comedy and actress Reim Kerichi's "Paris at any cost."
This is the story of the Maya model in the French capital, itself Kerichi, who is deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to the film, Kerichi and Naomi Watts will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean filmmaker Kim Ki Duck "Mébius", the melodramatic biopic by Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: A Story of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of the May Cannes Film Festival "Life of Adele" by Abdelatif Keshesh.
The only Russian member of "Art Mainstry" will be the winner of Alexander Veledinsky's film "Geographer of the globe" on the basis of Alexei Ivanov's novel.
Constantine Habenski played a major role in the film, the charming loser teacher Victor Savikin, whose work was also marked by the Kinotaur Award.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models of a way of life”, says the author.
Stories about the Torah could show that “gross power cannot defeat sophisticated tricks,” and legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach in schools,” Crossley-Holland is in favour of “desirable selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I was in favour of introducing them into the curriculum for 20 years.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “would be of interest” to children, and that the basic ideas were “shared” in fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, and wrote "Norwegian myths" for Penguin and "British folk fairy tales," said, "You may have intentions, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps a great difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an adult writer who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there must be an ingenuity of good and evil.
This should be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly articulated.
Old principle: show, not tell.
In Voronezhsk oblast, a football fan was detained breaking the window in the station waiting room.
At 9 p.m. on 29 October, at the Gryazi-Voronez station, transport police officers removed from the passenger train two football fans from the Moscow region.
Upon going to the game of the favorite team, the guys on the way got drunk on the train.
Young people were taken to the police line office at the Gryazi station to draw up an administrative offence report.
There, fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police officers filed administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train, and at the station station, they waited for him to arrive.
In the first half of the night, fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the front door window in the train station's waiting room with his foot.
A transport police officer and a security guard from the CPR “RZD” were roaming the broken glass.
They managed to apprehend an intruder trying to escape the scene.
The officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation of South-East LU are being screened.
There is a question of initiating criminal proceedings, and Sergey Olkhovik, a senior referencer of the South-East LU Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, has reported.
Vitaliy Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we're back 15 years.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots on the stands during the Russian Shinnick Cup, Spartacus.
I support the responsibility of the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we can see that they've taken a long stand.
They're waiting for someone from outside to clean up.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly the right one.
We should organize the fans, the clubs should invite their stewards, not let the case go.
We have now developed a special government regulation on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it's adopted, we'll get to the bottom of it.
But I'm sure I'll invite all of the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedoon's interview.
State, let's move the law faster.
It's like the Bavaria fans in Jaroslavl came and made it happen.
And we're outsiders.
In fact, it's terrible to see the podium watered out of the fireplace.
And it's in the country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're 10-15 years back," said Mutko.
Snowden can be interrogated in Russia.
Edward Snowden, an ex-American intelligence officer, is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify on the telephone wiretaps of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
According to Interfax, on Friday a source familiar with the situation can answer questions from the German Attorney General's Office in writing or face-to-face in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by US allies," said the agency's interlocutor.
“In principle, the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federal Republic could send representatives or written questions to Snowden in the Russian Federation”, the source added, adding that the matter should be addressed at the inter-State level.
Previously, German Bundestag member Hans-Christian Strebele reported that Edward Snowden was willing to testify in the case of a wiretapping by the United States intelligence services of the German Chancellor's talks.
Snowden is willing to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in German territory.
An ex-CIA officer has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although the U.S. NSA blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, to do so, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival,” reported Strabela to the Euronews TV channel.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoli Kucheren, commenting on the statement of Interfax's source, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide.
A U.S. citizen, Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. Homeland Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information on U.S. secret surveillance operations on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been revoked by the United States authorities who had indicted him in absentia and remained in the transit zone of the Sheremetevo airport until early August.
On 1 August, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russian territory for a period of one year and left Sheremetevo on the same day.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren stated that his client had taken up a job in a "large Russian company."
NSA surveillance of Angela Merkel last week was reported by the German media.
According to the reporters, the Chancellor’s telephone conversations had begun in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
Following the publication of this information, the German authorities claimed that the surveillance of Merkel violated German laws and sovereignty.
Ponomarev left Fair Russia.
Member of the State Duma of the Fair Russia Party, member of its division in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from a political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he filed an application with the party ' s regional office in Novibir.
According to its statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the justices.
We're sitting here, drinking tea...
"For some reason, a lot of people want to see the picture of "Ilya Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table," but there's nothing so epic about it," he commented.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained good relations with the regional essay office.
In the meantime, the mandate of the deputy of the State Duma, Ilya Ponomarev, does not intend to give up.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and was legally unable to withdraw.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the Fair Russia Party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Gudkov and Valery Zubov would join him from the RS, but the latter soon denied the information.
Japan will discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia
The head of the Japanese MIDA, Fumio Kisida, met with the Foreign Minister of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“I would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of the political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty”, stated Kisid at a meeting.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan visited Russia, relations between countries have become warmer and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, for his part, noted that the Russian Federation would meet Japan in dealing with difficult political issues, as RIA Novosty wrote.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies resolving the issue of disputed northern territories.
In that regard, there are protests in Tokyo today demanding that the land lost after World War II be returned to the country.
The Japanese capital is driven by cars with a loudspeaker saying, "Return the northern territories!"
The police don't stop the protesters, they make sure the noise is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It is bold to say that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago, an artist, Frank Fay, who worked as a conferenceer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Faye's novelty was eventually captured by other, most recently, New York's comedy festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hears, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headliners started at the Carolines, and then they made more success, and they reached a level where they were already too famous to perform at the club,” said Hirsch.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performances of Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the "Stendup for the Heroes", an annual musical and charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be among the participants.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have gained popularity in non-traditional ways, such as a show on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was famous for his role in a comedy show on a low-known cable television channel (not known as the FXX "Liga" on Fantasy Football), and now hosts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the acting team both in Saturday Night Live and in Parks and Recreational Zones, although it is best known for the series of viral videos entitled "Marsel - a Shoe Sculpture".
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with their own style (surrealistic pessimistic Anthony Jezelnick, a deceitful, racially focused Camau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be an interview with Larry David Steinberg.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“This city is certainly the central element of all Larry's work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks around some street between the two houses and thinks, "If I don't have any money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities started talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun talks with the Taliban.
This was reported by the British Embassy, where Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan is visiting.
The Head of Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice-Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister has reported that the dialogue with the Taliban has begun,” states the statement of the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said he hopes and prays for dialogue in accordance with Pakistan's Constitution,” the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Techic-Taliban Pakistan) are allies to the same-named Afghan movement, but operate independently of it in the north-west of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had previously attempted to negotiate with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would negotiate only if the authorities took troops stationed in areas where the Taliban were operating and released from prison the arrested Islamists.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for a peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil dropped to $96 a barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about large stocks eclipsed a message that China’s energy-intensive production sector was gaining momentum.
The standard United States oil grade in the December shipment was 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 a barrel later in the morning in European time in electronic tenders on the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract increased by 39 cents, bringing the price down by 5.8 per cent in October.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy announced on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels have been added.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, based on two reports of the Chinese industry showing an upsurge in its activity.
This indicates that China’s recovery may continue to gain momentum after growth in the third quarter has risen to 7.8 per cent after a 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brent's oil, a reference type of international oil, also used by United States refineries, increased by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the London Intercontinental Exchange.
Chief Coach "Colorado" Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release a holkiper, Semen Varlamov, from the first minute of the Friday match with "Dallas", expressed his confidence that the recent night behind the bar had not shaken his confidence in the Russian, passing from Dallas the subpoena to "SE" by Natalia Schmeleva.
And what do we have to wait for, Rua said after the morning roll, "Lavin."
Of course, what has happened concerns us all, but we are confident of it and feel that it will be good for him to get on the ice today.
We want him to go out to the ice and show him his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure the situation didn't affect the gatekeeper's condition?
We'll see about that today.
Our players will no doubt support Varley by helping him guard the gate, as was the case in the previous games of this season.
The point is, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until the court has sorted out the situation.
In Siberia, you don't have to be a vegan: a warmer tomato doesn't replace soup.
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, researched by RIA News.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
They can't survive the winter here without health losses, and no greenhouse tomatoes can compensate for them, so the vegan polled on the eve of Vegan Day are called new-Siberian dietologists and doctors.
Drinking butter with liters
Strict vegetarianism, when discarded not only by meat and fish, but also by milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietologists believe that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia it is at least unhealthy to adhere to such strict food standards.
Total abandonment of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain indispensable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate by plantation.
You have to have at least milk or eggs in your diet,' I'm sure the nutritionist Marina Godei.
It gives an example of a fish containing an indispensable omega-3 fatty acid.
His richest vegetable oil is linen.
"To supply it with the quantities necessary for man, you have to drink a litre!" says a dietist.
Medical doctors believe that Siberians need to pay special attention to the diet in winter.
This season, vegetarianism is particularly questioned.
In our reality, food demands are high.
You need an elevated calorie to keep you warm.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, accordingly, he is underprivileged by this calorie," says a specialist.
The nutritionist Olga Poznjak agrees.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the answer.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region or where he was born.
The genetic code is geared to better understanding and digesting these products.
And in winter, people don't want to eat a cucumber, they want a hot soup or something better,” the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, different grains, grains, beans, local vegetables, apples remaining in winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But it's certainly not enough to feed.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudius Arifulina, the levels of vitamins in the anthrax are only sufficient from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete shift to vegetarianism in our harsh natural environment, where temperatures can change by 30 degrees in 24 hours and snow lies in May, incomprehensible.
The body needs energy for life, and that's, first of all, fat,” says the medical doctor.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them inferior ones.
Pregnant women also need increased protein, vitamins and micronutrients on the menu.
"The vegans don't get it," I'm sure God.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, "play the toys he wants."
He's got a body, a skeleton, organs.
Still, children must be fully fed.
If his parents deprive him of any micronutrients or amino acids by choosing for him what he's going to eat, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of a substance for brain development, vision, bones will never be restored tomorrow," she says.
All medical professionals interviewed agree on the low quality of winter-growing plants in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought in and grown in greenhouses contains fewer micronutrients we need than (growing) in open soil.
"The quality of food is not the same," says God.
Arifulina also notes that imported and warm vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
At times, the willingness of producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
"The apples don't get brown on the cut, the cucumbers quickly get yellow and mold, the tomatoes are tasteless and neuromatic," cites medical examples, adding that they are likely to be filled with excessive amounts of fertilizer.
And they don't get vitamins, they're getting cellulars.
The Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology of Agrarian Problems, a candidate for agricultural sciences, Vera Petruk, disagrees with this.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all the standards and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full - grown vegetables.
If they try to get more from a square metre, they will certainly get more water and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow rapidly, they are large but watery and watery,” she explains, adding that the quality issue depends primarily on the producer's conscience.
The court suspended enforcement of the “stop-and-search” practice in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the enforcement of a court order requiring changes in the stop-and-search programme of the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Second District Court of Appeal stated that the execution of Judge Shira Scheindlin ' s decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of the city ' s appeal.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution in the way he carried out the programme of street detention and interrogation.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and corrective action orders, including an order to appoint a supervisor to help the police department change its work practices and related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a hearing on the parties ' motion for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge had to be recused because she had violated the U.S. Code of Conduct and had not considered it necessary to avoid being biased, partly because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to court criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably addressing blacks and Latin Americans under the stop-and-search programme.
It appointed an external controller to oversee major changes, which include policy, training and monitoring reforms, and decided to launch a pilot programme to test television cameras in police stations where most of the detentions took place.
In August, New York decided to discontinue the storage of names and addresses of people whose cases had been discontinued after police review.
The City ' s appeal is due to take place after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactics were criticized by a large number of civil rights lawyers.
Stop Search has been practised for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American.
In 2004, four people, all members of national minorities, filed a collective lawsuit.
Proponents of the “stop-and-search” programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to bad practices, form a more reliable and effective police service and can influence the way other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce police fighting rather than crime, lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult police conditions by reducing the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she was continuing the practice of “stop-and-search”, which was consistent with the Constitution, but was changing the way the New York Police stopped people.
In the area of the Tretikov Gallery, a pedestrian zone was opened
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretikovskaya Gallery and is located two kilometres from the subway station Novokoznetskaya to the Bolt Square.
All along, street torches, flower shops, berries, urns and toilets, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been installed.
In addition to the Klimensky and Lavrušinsk alleys, which were already pedestrians, five streets — the Ordinsky impasse, the Great and Small Tolmačevsky alleys, the Kadashev Coast and the Bolt Square — were closed for cars.
Transport traffic through the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not restricted.
In the section of Friday Street, from the Lobby of the Novokoznyskaya station to the Klimenski alley, the conditions for pedestrians have been created without removing the traffic and cutting the carriageway, and they transmit newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretekow Gallery, the temple of the priest Clement of the Pope, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, the Tver Pass, the alley alleys and the Kuznetskay Bridge were completely pedestrians.
The large Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone hack to check a confidential message.
The former editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, allegedly used the "blow-up phone, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm false information about Charles Clarke's novel, who was then Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, Crown Counsel Andrew Edies told the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005, News of the World had received unreliable news that Clark was meeting with her “attractive special adviser” Hannah Polby.
The newspaper directed private detective Glenn Mulkeyre to hack Paulby's voice mail and watched her outside to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages, and the court heard.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person to be standing around someone's house hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is the person who likes to offer history to people to see what they're going to say,” Mr. Edys said.
He said that News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hack?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The rumours about Clarke's novel first drew the attention of News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voice messages received from her phone at least three times was removed from the house of Mulkeyr in August 2006.
Investigators also found the records on the private investigator's computer, where Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as Projects.
During her period of surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, said Mr. Edis.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Wezerap monitored Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we're planning to publish tomorrow that I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edys said that Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same scenario as other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson was in confrontation with Mr. Blankett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was meeting with a co-defendant, Rebecca Brooks, who was at the time married.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with other people to hack their phones from October 3, 2000 to August 9, 2006.
Mulkeyre, Turlbeck and Wezerap confessed to hacking their phones.
Snowden says he's ready to talk to the German authorities about the wiretap case.
C.I.A. Ex-C.I. Edward Snowden expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the German authorities, and transmits the RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA official to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday presented the Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele, through which Snowden conveyed a message to the German authorities.
Strebele met Snowden the previous day in Moscow.
Four people were injured by a fire on Tver Street
Four passersby persons were injured by fire in a collector in the centre of Moscow, on Tver Street.
According to Interfax, with reference to the source in the emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby persons were injured during a fire in a smoked underground crossing.
According to RIA Novosty, referring to the head of the Metropolitan Department of Fuel and Energy, Pavel Livinsky, electricity is now fully restored to all houses on Tver Street.
The fire in the heat collector near home 15 on Tver Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
There was a heavy smoke from the rainy sewer hatches, and a smoke was created in the underground crossing at Armenia's store.
11 houses on Tver Street were demolished as a result of the fire.
At 9:45 a.m. Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
US cuts in food allowance for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday, US financial support for food stamps, known as food stamps, has been declining as the government program ends.
A family of four will now be allocated $36 a month less than previously, according to officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, the benefit per person averaged $133 per month.
Food aid spending in the United States has increased to $80 billion a year because of rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid provided by foodstamps, which has been named since the time when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in Congress demand further cuts in the funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it most.
Food shop owners across America are concerned that cuts will reduce consumer spending.
U.S. congressmen continue to argue about reducing government funding as much as possible.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform free of charge.
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform on the PC free of charge.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game became available on Battle.net as part of the classic Blizzard games.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can now download it.
The game is also not available for Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has just released on the PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne Platformer, released 19 years ago by Blizzard, originally entered the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Toul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright king of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak's associates and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its renaming as Blizzard Entertainment.
It was previously called Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was Interplay.
There will be new machines in the Moscow subway.
But selling tickets to passengers is not for money, it's for sitting down.
One trip of 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger 30 sit-downs.
The number of sit-downs will be calculated using modern technology, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first machine will be installed at the Exhibition Station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of the new tickets, the President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, and the Olympic champions Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamočíkova will be welcomed.
Recognition of the National Security Agency reinforces corporate paranoia with regard to State surveillance
On a warm day late in August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
According to the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, his mission was to photograph the roof of the United States Mission Building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media say that BfV was hoping to find the antennes of listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the US and the German Foreign Office in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of US National Intelligence, again assured in September that the US did not use foreign intelligence to steal foreign business secrets in the interest of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or their profits.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractual employee who has become a denouncer, has started publishing his treasure of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure if the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency had been following the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data stored by US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been tapped for about ten years.
If Europe’s most powerful person could be targeted, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies evident.
I think it's possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grun, president of the BITMI association, representing Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US now represents almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a July study published by the EY Consulting Agency.
All of Mr. Snowden’s disclosures, however, still did not show that the United States was transferring business secrets to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked some information technology and Internet capabilities and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are sceptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of a German software supplier for SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of US spy agencies, which became known through Snowden’s revelations, was a shock to some companies that had previously thought that China was the biggest risk of surveillance.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US are under the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American members refused to use the services of a US-based cloud provider after exposing the American software for the intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Sneib, one of SAP’s executive directors, said, “We see consumers asking a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew: powerful nations want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore they must be protected at all costs.
It is not surprising that economic espionage is taking place.
It's always happened.
“This has been the subject of debate for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate,” says Kurt Bok, CEO of the BASF chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them too, because it is part of our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about the response they have made, as it may give an advantage to the opponent.
The idea of taking a free drive at the exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room has long been learned in large companies — at least not prudent.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi Automobile Construction Company, says that for many years it has been a standard practice to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that company leaders consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their particular niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access”, warns BfV.
The US warns its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Report placed France, together with Russia and Israel, in a second series of violators who are hacking for economic intelligence after China, claims The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Scarcini, former head of the DCI, said in an interview this month: “The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a young man in Georgia who died in a "famous accident" believe that their son was killed
The parents of a young man from Georgia, whose body was found inside a folded sports mat in his high school gym, believe that their son was killed, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertical matt, sitting in the back of his high school gym.
Investigators of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old youth contests this.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com, Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he was dead as the sheriff says.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, the laws of physics, and common sense,” Crump said.
They think it's a cover to protect a person or people responsible for their son's death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll look into all the facts, wherever they're going.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I am of the view that there are sufficient grounds” for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the primary autopsy revealed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxiation.”
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
“There are a few questions to be resolved or clarified”, he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to call for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The Londes County Sheriff's Office was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to publish all the videos of the surveillance cameras that the investigators were looking at.
The teenager’s parents said that they hoped that the videos contained the key to finding out how he died.
"Spartacus": For the information about the individuals who hung up fascist symbols.
On the official website of Spartacus, a statement by the Moscow Club was made about the appearance of a fascist flag on the podium in Jaroslavla.
"On 30 October, at the Shinnick Cup, Spartak, unknown provoctors at the Yaroslavla Stadium showed fascist symbols.
We appeal to all those who have reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence to be provided with it.
"The reward is guaranteed," says the statement.
Looking for fans hanging a fascist flag in Jaroslavla.
In the 1/16 finals, the Shinnick Cup of Russia, Spartacus, was interrupted several times because of the riots on the stands.
A fascist symbol was also shown in the Spartacus fans' sector.
Spartacus can hold about three games without an audience.
There will be a meeting of the Committee on Friday.
If you have any information on who took this symbol and put it up, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on child allergies
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The manual provides information to schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff of food allergies among children and how to help with allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools maintain adrenaline reserves — most commonly used for injections by EpiPen’s automatic medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended the regulations to allow schools to supply adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children having an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "It feels like something's sticking into my tongue," "it feels like I've got hair in my tongue," or "the tongue's pinching."
Parents of intersex children can choose “undefined sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with intermediate sexual organs.
Newborns will no longer be required to be male or female.
The new law does not require parents to name any sex of such children, allowing parents to identify gender as “undefined” or “unidentified” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could decide hastily on a sex-appropriation operation and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
One intersex person, according to BBC, said many years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'm going to be a doctor-created squirrel with bruises and scars.
Approximately one of the 2,000 children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological states that are diagnosed as “sexual disorders” — a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (auticals or seedlings) or unusually developed external sexual organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still under-examined, but most experts in the US say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and to attribute it to it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of a child before an operation, if any.
A New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said that the new German law “was sounding like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require rapid intervention, but most children do not,” he said.
You can take the floor without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people can be homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as distinct from transgender or transgender people, as their condition is not gender-related, but their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but is typical of both at the same time or is not characteristic of either.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and body structure; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender disabilities now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to place male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Walby, became the first man in the world to be “no-sex”, claiming the right to remain “indeterminate” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third mark in addition to M and F to X, i.e. intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also disagreed with the German law, saying that “in situations where the world is drawn into a new state where gender is the object of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also informed the Baby Zone website that she would prefer the children to have sex at birth.
“It is hard enough to have a child without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,” she said to the parent’s website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, a beautiful Greek god who had both genders.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a leaf that could be erased and then painted again.
But now many argue ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make wrong choices without knowing how a child will view the sex he or she has acquired when he or she grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called an emergency psychiatric case,” Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist; you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was proposed by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that the signals of the environment, including the social — the way parents raise a child — interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would consider himself to be a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were in question.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during a negligent circumcision, to castrate the child completely, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn't,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But when he was 38 years old, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these sex-change operations stated that they were “dissatisfied with the result.”
This was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but intermediate genitals.
The doctors could not determine whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” of a man.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s outer sexual organs and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He began to have female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said to ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned vaginal plastic.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he demanded medical records.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Once he learned the truth, he became a man again, getting shots of testosterone and removing his chest.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, the executive director of the California Law Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law is “inciting labels and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an undefined sex,” she said.
We're afraid it'll facilitate intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law because “it allows adults to choose for the third sex.”
“People must be able to make their own decisions about formal sex”, she says.
The German law refers to her being embezzled at birth.
It's a battle that little children shouldn't go into at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baraz, a mammologist-retgenologist from Pittsburgh, who has a sexually challenged daughter who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law would “support” both parents and children.
Barac's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual disorder called the "androgen insensitivity syndrome".
Because her androgenic receptors are not working correctly, Katie has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and is interning for child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to be a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves,” Baraz said.
It gives them time to make some analyses and to understand the situation, as well as a period of time before they write “male” or “female”.
In that case, you are fine — raising a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel happy.
We don't have to rush into a surgery that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the anxiety that parents cause because they do not feel that they are doing the right thing,” she said.
After all, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with — and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
The Chicago gateman, Nikolai Habibulin, emphasized that he understands that he must play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two Hawks meetings, Habibulin first missed six tampa Bay pucks, then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I failed to do so, CSNChicago quotes Habibulina's words.
I need to find confidence in my training, and I think I should look at them like games and try to get better.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings you've had.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in practice, I feel quite decent.
But for some reason, after a few heads, it turns into some sort of snow coma.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The gatekeepers -- I don't think I'm the only one -- are always trying to do the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself to keep the puck on.
It's nice to have my clubmates back up, but basically it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to do them a lot better.
But it happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'm just gonna try to get the next game back better.
A flight bus crashed on Altaya.
In the Rubtsov district of Altaysk province, a PAZ flight bus crashed.
As a result of the accidents, 13 people were reported to the Regional Office of the MES, according to the updated data.
In the past, law enforcement authorities in the region reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred around 9 a.m. local time on the Novonicolaevka - Vishnevka road, 1 kilometre from Novonikolayevka.
The bus from Rubtsovska to Vishnevka contained 12 passengers and a driver, all suffered injuries of varying degrees of gravity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to Rubtsovska City Hospital No. 1, and two were hospitalized in Rubsovska CRS.
Medvedev expects SSJ-100 to be flown to Europe.
Russia expects that after the consolidation of the Latin American and Asian markets, Superjet 100 aircraft will also be delivered to Europe.
“We expect a total of more than 170 copies of this type of aircraft to obtain such arrangements”, Interfax quotes Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of Russia at a press conference with Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero of France.
The head of the Russian Government noted that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once the aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he'll be brought to France someday," stressed the Russian premier.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by Civil Dry Airlines in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner is developed on the basis of modern technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in a segment of 100 passenger seats.

Anja’s grandmother, whose home in the village of Ivanovka of Petrikovsky has been inhabited by an aristic family for 20 years, began to notice how the nest was settling despite the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds are putting new rags on top, and the lower layer is already lying between the wires, and it's about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity for a family of hawks who nested in the cottage every year, brought out and fed three or four chicks in the summer, but I don't want to be left without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm places, Anja’s grandmother called the Czarician REC, which owns the support.
I didn't even expect them to react that fast.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still in place, told the DneProblenergo technical director of DTEC, Sergey Berezovsky.
On the wires, which were essentially inside a nest weighing between 150 and 200 kilograms, corrosion began.
At any time, birds could have been killed by electric discharge.
And the locals risked losing light because of the wire damage.
So linear monthers started a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from Dnipropetrov National University helped to develop a nest transfer scheme.
They also conducted training sessions for district network staff.
The famous daypropetrovian ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko consulted energy at all stages of nest reconstruction.
For starters, it was estimated that there were more than 50 aristic “suits” in the area.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms similar to a crow have been made.
The base was sprinkled with branches of vine and then moved to an old nest.
In the opinion of experts, it is sufficient to lay down the old branches as a basis for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Then the storks will build their own dwelling.
A month ago, the first nest was rebuilt in the village of Sandshanka in the Newoskovsky region.
Next to the electrospray, a new iron concrete pole was installed and placed on it a platform with an old, already inhabited nest.
The whole operation cost 9000 hryvnias.
And the other day, the same house was held in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky district, on the outskirts of Ani’s grandmother.
This is where the platform was fixed, just up above the wires.
Ornithologists believe that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their apartment has been renovated.
By the end of the year, four more nests are expected to be rebuilt in the Pocrovsky and Zaricán districts of Dnipropetrovczyk.
By the way, while some rescue rare birds, others kill them ruthlessly.
The other day, the whole area was overflowing with the sad news that, in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolic Region, on the day of the launch of the pheasant hunt, poachers shot a swan family living on a local pond for entertainment.
The noble birds were not afraid of humans; the locals fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the shots and ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying dead on the water.
The Apostolic Police Division is now investigating who shot the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian March is getting more popular.
On 4 November, on the Day of National Unity, Moscow will be held in agreement with the Municipality of the Russian March.
According to the Levada Center survey, the support for the Russian marches is increasing, with 40% of the citizens approving them to varying degrees.
According to the Levada Center, 40 per cent of citizens have different degrees of approval for the Russian marches, of which 11 per cent are definitely positive and 29 per cent are “promptly positive”.
The popularity of the “Russian Marches” has gradually increased, with only 14 per cent of Russians welcoming these events in 2006, and more than twice as many citizens (28 per cent) supporting such activities in December 2010.
Only 7 per cent of Russians are classified as “negatively” and 19 per cent as “negatively”.
A further 35% were unable to formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the Moscow City Hall agreed on a “Russian March” of up to 15,000 people in Ljublino, which was reported today by the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majorov.
This nationalist action has taken place every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
In response to a question from sociologists, “Have you heard that Russian marches are held in Russia on 4 November under slogans for the protection of Russian rights in Russia?” Three quarters (75%) of citizens responded negatively.
Only one in five Russians (20%) knows about this stock.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost one third of the citizens (31 per cent) heard about the Russian marches.
Three years ago, a natural nationalist rally took place on 11 December in Mange Square, which turned into a riot.
Levada Center also asked the Russians what holiday was celebrated on 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (People ' s Day) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
However, only 15 per cent of citizens are attending the holiday.
About the same (17%) plan to celebrate November 7th of the October Revolution Day.
Most citizens (62 per cent) do not intend to celebrate any of these holidays.
How Moscow City Hall agreed on the "Russian March" in Lublino
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to a “Russian March” on 4 November in Ljublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Russians, the organizer of the Dmitry Demushkin march.
In addition to the Ljublino walk, there will be a rally and a Corrot Rock Concert, also agreed with the authorities.
How did "Russ Marsh 2012" go?
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, the nationalists marched from the Yakiman River to the Central House of the Artist, where the rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants to be 20,000, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs referred to the figure of 6,000.
Communication: Obama's campaign headquarters was considering the exclusion of Biden in favour of Hillary Clinton.
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama’s closest advisers were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the most striking sensation of all of the expected book by Mark Halperin and John Hailemann on the 2012 campaign "The Stavs Double: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and announced on Thursday evening that the immediate assistants of the president had conducted “scaling research in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether the exclusion of Baiden could help raise the declining hopes for Obama’s re-election.
According to political commentator The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by senior officials of the electoral headquarters and the White House, the former head of the White House, Bill Daley, to assess the impact of the election of former Secretary of State Clinton as Vice-President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded at Chicago Election Headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers — including Daley, former head of Obama's campaign headquarters, Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisors, David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book The Stacks Doubled claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden despite their “near personal relationship”, but eventually abandoned it when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not “make Obama’s chances significant. ”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Byden Clinton.
“I have been actively in favour of considering a lot of things, and it was one of them,” said Daley to the newspaper.
You should remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what do we do?"
Although Daley described the study as a “necessary test,” Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the election headquarters had invested enough in examining whether this step would bring dividends to the vote.
“Electoral headquarters do not spend such sums of money on polls and focus groups unless they consider something seriously,” Martin said in the AK 360 program.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of replacing him.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about a possible altercation.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the president was “informed” of a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that Obama “maybe” knew.
Martin added that the Stavs Doubled did not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the results of political sensing had reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama had not been aware of the study of the possibility of removing Byden from the electoral list.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
You want a glow in the dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first glowing ice cream in the dark with a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with this idea by reading a scientific article about jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically recreate glowing proteins.
The ice cream reacts with the language of the person who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and forcing it to glow.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Line me, I'm delicious," says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still in the very early stages of production, so for £200 you'll get about 2 g of the substance."
The squirrel we use in ice cream reacts to your language with a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up a squirrel, it'll raise the pH level and the ice cream will start glowing.
We've been testing it over the last few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it produces such a wonderful glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the fluorescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So every balloon costs me about £140.
It tastes pretty good, though.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and taste of cosmetic gold.
But its next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
It's by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Avangard coach Vladimir Čebaturkin, referring to the preparation of his team for the regular KHL against Salawat, noted that Omichi had conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Metalurg magnetic team.
The expert stressed that the Avantgarde needed to focus on the defense game.
We've been watching a video game against the magnetic Metalurga, and this is the official website of the Avantgarde of Chebaturkin's words.
- We missed a lot of pucks, not a very nice moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because they failed to play.
We knew the opponent had performers.
Statistically, they had five hits on the move-- three pucks beat us.
Very good implementation.
Have these errors been taken into account in preparing for today's game?
The guys and I, we take each game carefully, we talk after the game, we prepare for a new rival.
The main thing is that the installation is being carried out.
Everyone saw the first season of the match against Metalurg.
A game assignment was performed, and the score was 2:0.
They missed the goal in the locker room, and in the third period, they started to make mistakes.
Given how hard the game worked, he didn't see any point in connecting the defenses.
You've got to back off with the whole team.
Now the Avantgard has a long home series, the matches are coming in the next day, and the team's got a lot of fatigue?
All commands are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is to do your moments and play assignments.
Hockey is an emotional game, and if you do the setup, it's not that hard to solve.
Due to the new regulations introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of furs have been in line for almost a week at the border with Russia.
Today, Donetsi officials promised to provide drinking water and biota for drivers.
There were hundreds of furs at border points when entering Russia.
This situation is due to the change in the customs procedures for the handling of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm that the Russian side is in the queue, which did not warn of any new developments in advance.
Since 28 October, the Russian Customs authorities have introduced additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, as reported by the Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs, Vladimir Denisov.
The new model is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
Passports are in advanced mode.
FACTOV's correspondent visited the border and contacted truckers who had been held hostage.
Prices at the Novoazovsk road shop are rising every day, as is the queue from the fur.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two kilometers.
The Novoazovsk - Veselo-Vazenka Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine on the international motorway.
The goods are therefore sent to the Stavropolsk province of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight, a trucker named Alexei Golovanev, who is transiting the cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week, complains.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance over which they are transported.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5,000 roubles (about 1,100 - 1,300 hryvnias).
Those who travel nearby (say Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 roubles (3,800 hryvnias) and travel.
And the others are stuck because no one has that much money with them!
Can you imagine if a driver is carrying a shipment worth just $4000, but to Moscow, he needs 90,000 roubles (almost 23,000 hriven) to pay for transit!
There are no conditions for survival at the border, but far-distance truckers who eat near their cars.
Border shops and cafes are always expensive, but we've never seen prices like this!
The sellers directed themselves and quickly swept them out: 15 hrivens standing at a bar, seven hrivens at a cup of coffee, and 25 hriven at a plate of soup.
There's only one cafe.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the bathroom.
No washing, no shaving...
I can stay out of my car for a week, and my wife's got it all ready for me.
I'll spend a week comforting myself with another trucker, Victor Scotarenko.
But will my car be in line in a week?
Why do you have a liter and a half of water?
There's 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, is the bottle crystal or is the water insistent on silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take it while there's something else, the saleswoman's steaming.
After media coverage began, the plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities in the region.
The leadership of the Ambrosia and Novoazov Railways has been entrusted with the task of providing drinking water to all those who stand in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border, as stated by the Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Oblast, Sergey Dergunov.
Emergency teams are now on duty at the crossing points.
Biotueles will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the queue problem will be resolved in the coming days.
As of 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles were parked at the international checkpoints of the “Uspenka” and “Novoazovsk”, according to Donetska press service.
The “FACTS” will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president.
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against Lithuanian dignitaries and Eastern Partnership countries, a statement made by the BNS agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, Moscow is going to “converse” the President of Lithuania, Dal Grybauskait, and publish falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosarchiv, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the Department of Analysis of the Public Processes of the Administration of the Russian President ' s Administration for Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is responsible for preparing the information attack.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania on numerous occasions and participated in the Congress of the Lithuanian People ' s Party.
A staff member from the department of V. Smirnov is also alleged to be involved in the operation.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov travelled regularly to Lithuania under cover of scientific work until the end of 2012 and was in contact with local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov is now barred from entering the country.
On the eve of the day, the President of Lithuania, Grybauskait, announced that he knew about the computer plant that was preparing for it.
In her view, the main reason was Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and “the country's desire for energy independence”
The Lithuanian leader has previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities on several occasions.
She claimed that Lithuania was “not respectful enough” in the Kremlin.
In addition, Gribauskait accused the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, of proposing “only claims” to Lithuania.
Let's recall, in September Rosmesnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products was not in accordance with sanitary and epidemiological standards.
The Lithuanian leader then stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government should prepare its application to WTO.
In the U.S., the school principal shot at teenagers.
The headmasters of one of the American high schools have literally made teenagers desperate.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, young bullies threw toilet paper at a man's house.
As a result, the principal of the school opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the bullies were not on the property of the director, he was charged with aggravated assault.
A man was released from prison on bail at $125,000.
Note that shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened a shooting in downtown Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California, just down the street.
The perpetrator then took two random passers-by hostages, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Previously, there was a shooting at Newtown Elementary School, Connecticut.
Adam's mom worked at school, and she was an educator.
Shots fired at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on 31 January at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

2013 Halloween in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late to sleep, and put on a camouflage for our neighborhood.
I'm more of a scumbag right now.
I haven't called in the last two years to hand out candy in my apartment, and I'm probably not gonna do it this year.
However, the statistics show that I'm a white crow with regard to Halloween.
According to the National Distributive Federation, most Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation estimates that it will cost $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent on costumes.
This year, sexual inanimate objects are at the peak of fashion.
Women are no longer required to be sex workers; they can also be sexual food, such as pizzas, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies because of "The Walking Dead," and I'm sure that the Daft Punk-style astronauts will get into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are most often sought are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
There's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
It means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't give a shit.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, candy candy, Milk Dods candy, Twizzlers chewing candy, and Clark Bar candy candy.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, that's great news for 41 million candy kids who are ready to conquer our neighborhoods.
Moreover, we're going to buy and -- we're not going to cheat ourselves -- we're going to eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is candy in the form of cornseeds; yet, according to the National Association of bakers, almost 35 million pounds are sold for Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery that I still have to solve.
Nothing expresses Halloween more than haunted houses.
They have amazing names, such as "Awe behind the walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Wraith and screaming" and "The House of Shock."
Moreover, according to American Hunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America that generate about $500 million in income, as well as the amazing pictures you almost painted, which your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't remove, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like, "Cool Face Expression."
And in conclusion, we'll talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting Jack's lamp is like decorating the Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Luckily for us, the baby fashion in the pumpkin started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's lamp, slowly drying on your porch, is probably coming from the state of Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want a harder assignment, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to cut something out of their 2032-pound pumpkin.
The Estonian Defense Department site was rebuilt after an attack by Ukrainian hackers.
The site of the Estonian Ministry of Defence has been reinstated after the morning cyberattack, reporting to the Ministry ' s press service.
According to the Vice-Chancellor of Defense for Information and Administration, Timmar Petercope, it was a primitive attack, the site was overloaded with a lot of requests.
Our specialists have fixed things quickly, and the site's work has now been rebuilt.
"The damage to the Ministry is minimal," said Petershop to the Posttimees.
According to Petercob, it's too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
“We will certainly analyse the causes of the incident and draw conclusions from it, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents”, he acknowledged.
On 1 November, Anonymous Akraine posted an online message confirming a hacking attack on the Estonian Ministry of Defence website and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need the NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," says Anonymous.
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine previously reported that the company of the Marines of the Teodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marines would take part in the NATO reaction force command and staff exercises, Steadfast Jazz-2013.
A few schools and a hospital had to be shut down because of the violence of unclean power.
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matabeleland had to be closed because the students were attacked by... goblins.
According to a local elder, the children panicked, and it was not possible to continue their studies.
The story of goblins may sound like an invention of a child for a European, but in Africa this is a very serious argument for school closure.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, a hospital was closed in Zimbabwe because medical personnel were also attacked by goblins.
The Land Rover race series has been announced.
Inside are race seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an internal communication system.
It is also possible to obtain improved brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and car storage between activities.
Drew Bauler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said, "The rally's associates at Bowler have changed."
Some of them are not experienced riders, but people looking for excitement, adventures and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try the different disciplines of the rally in Britain and abroad, and to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally.
We've had great pleasure in developing the Defender Challenge car -- it's going to be a really exciting championship.
Defender Challenge also provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in events in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian Silovists are not aware of the Brotherhood Group - New News
INTERFAX.RU writes about this with reference to an informed source in Russian law enforcement agencies.
"After media reports of the U.S. Department of Finance placing Leps on control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Brath Circle', we looked through all the databases, but no such group was found," said the agency's interlocutor.
In his view, the dissemination of that information helped to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which allegedly operated abroad.
As previously written by NI, yesterday the U.S. Department of Finance posted on its website a list of alleged members of the Brats Circle criminal group.
Among them was the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He appears on the list as Grisha, posted the previous day.
They match the data of a popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevridze, creative alias, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other persons mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, an Uzbek citizen, and another one from the former USSR, whose nationality is not specified.
The U.S. is confident that Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, was transporting money for the bandits on their order.
This report includes a picture of the singer and all his relevant data.
Moreover, Leps did buy a house on Phuket recently.
The department noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
Putting a person on blacklists in the U.S. Department entails freezing his assets in the U.S. and prohibiting business contacts with him by people living in the United States.
Assistant Leps Maya Serikov stated that no notices had been given to the singer: “It is difficult to answer the question whether this is the Gregory that everyone is talking about now in connection with the US scandal.”
All Leps knows is the media.
He has not been formally notified, although I do not know if they do exist in such cases.
"And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, surprising and unexpected," she said to RIA News.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live on Phuket, but according to the U.S. Department, he does have a house on a Thai island.
She stated that Leps was currently on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that news caught him on a flight to the city of Blavetschensk.
Runnin' out on the field in the Shinnick game.
Some details became available about the identity of the fan who escaped to the field during the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup between the Jaroslav Shinnick and the Moscow Spartak.
According to the head of the RFC, Arthur Grigorianz, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the supporter is a Moscow.
He's in custody right now.
"Grigorianz also spoke about how the fan managed to break through the field: "It turns out that this one, we call him a viewer, went to the ambulance, accompanied by two viewers, citing heart problems.
He went to the ambulance, confirmed by the E.R.
Then he pushed two escorts away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South Tribune to the corner of the East and North Tribune.
He ran through all the fields.
The stewards are responsible.
Until the law on sports comes into force, it's a steward's area of action - the police can't interfere with what's on the field.
He ran to the rostrum, climbed over the East Tribune.
And at that time, riots broke out on the East Tribune and on the trails,” said the head of the KDC.
Recall that by decision of the KDC, the Moscow Spartacus will hold the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championship against the Locomotive and Zenita, and will pay a fine of 600,000 roubles.
The fire brigades were called to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous career concession.
Coker-spaniel Ruby ran away after she had a little accident.
Three days later, she was caught in a career and noticed by a man walking a dog.
The firemen came down on a rope on a hillside to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was lucky to be saved after the fire brigades were called to lift him up and take him to a safe place, after he somehow got stuck at 50 feet high on a dangerous slope.
A nine-month-old Coker-spaniel, Ruby, ran away after having had a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her masters, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at the Fleppet's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were feverishly looking for their missing dog and posting messages on social media sites after she ran off to the quarry after a small accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a star dog guide spotted Ruby stuck at a height of 50 feet in his career.
A technical rescue team from the Clekhiton fire station rushed to the scene, came down on ropes to save Ruby, and used a transporter to lift her up the hill.
Andy Clayton, a rescue officer, said, "She was in danger."
It was right in the middle of a high slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move her muscle during the rescue, she's completely frozen.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
The rescue officer Peter Lau said, "Ruby is very lucky to be rescued."
There was a chance that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for a check-up, and it was found that she was all right, with the exception of exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "It was scary to watch over the rescue."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when we got her back in our hands.
The vet said that if she had fainted and lost consciousness, she would likely have fallen.
The firemen were great.
It was very brave — what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added: “We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there.”
The firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he wasn't flirting with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, a pop star stated that she was a back singer for the 2004 Jagger song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a rocker vet, and she said, "He was flirting with me when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of 70-year-old Jagger said that he “kategoryly denied that he had ever hit Katie Perry.”
The representative added: “Perhaps she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking up with Europe gives the Scots a choice.
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition for EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Adrian's shaft.
True, Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement in the rest of Europe, although — and predictablely — it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has anyone indicated that EU member countries spend a lot of time turning their formal rules as they please.
Since Scotland is no longer part of the Schengen Zone, continuing to fail will be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for what he really wanted from the Scots.
So it's a story that doesn't deserve attention.
And it's so old that it's become a fossil: for the first time, I heard a duck saying that “independence means passport control”, at least 40 years ago.
Still, there's an interesting moment lost in the story of an old story.
Why does an independent Scotland have to obey Europe’s orders?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With Eurocrisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
All over the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or for the euro to be abolished as a single currency are gaining power.
Even in Germany, the party of Euroskeptics “Alternative for Germany” — founded only this year — came out of nowhere and won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus effectively pushing the “Free Democrats” (the analogy of our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency led many to believe that the Europe project had gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are working with excessive fiscal deficits — that was only true of Greece.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members at exchange rates that benefit German exporters — what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself at a predetermined disadvantage in terms of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut wages and public spending, which Berlin actively supports.
Behind the current problems of the budget and currency is the deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacity.
As a result of the Green Energy package introduced by Brussels — a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the consumer’s expense — European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the US.
It's a paralysing unfavourable price environment, as we've seen in Granjmouth.
No freeze on wages in the world will stop the devastating victory of US cheap slate gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is an uprising, especially in France, once by the EU’s most powerful supporter.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and to place Paris at the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s devastated economy in distress.
The result is a right-wing anti-EU party, Marín Le Pen, the National Front, which has just won decisive additional elections, putting the ruling party of socialists in third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of votes — a timely warning to British Labourers that it cannot be assumed that splits among the right will automatically affect the left.
What's Le Pen doing with her new-found popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If – and this is very likely – anti-EU parties are supported in these elections, such a bloc will be able to dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my point: the growing mood against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will come together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something of a vague “Europe (submissive) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distanced from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain is likely to be neglected in the cold of the Atlantic.
In what position does that leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in essence) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect Scotland will succeed in a more free European arrangement, provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-Federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is, strangely speaking, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which gained an impressive majority of votes in 2011 owing to objections to cost reductions proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of Treasury, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Tory and Liberal Democrat Coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence just to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Early Aging
African American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers do research.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that obesity can be a trigger mechanism for early puberty.
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Eterage is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened if her daughter begins to form breast embryos and grows pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Paediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time soothing my parents — usually it doesn't mean a rapid rise in full puberty,” Kaplovitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair, and the smell of the body, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a small shift in menarche age (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and fell from 12.75 in 1970.
“As the breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before the menarche,” said Kaplovitz, also author of the book “The Rising Puberty of Girls: How to Cope With the Difficult Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a discussion of what constitutes actual puberty, but is considered to be “early” when breast increase is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to eight years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or slow down — the paediatrician can monitor closely.
More rapid progression can be used as a basis for an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can eventually lead to slow growth and low growth at a mature age.
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the child’s age, development, growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is careful with medication, but admits that “addiction of puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and the feeling of girls that they are different from their peers.”
Another big problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they can handle hygiene,” Kaplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter began her menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, have early puberty.
Kaplovitz claims that the assumption that has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, it helped to conduct a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age, which linked the amount of fat in the body to the period of puberty.
Other evidence supports this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latin-American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers.
There are different explanations.
Worldwide, early puberty appears to be affected by everything, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
A further riddle is that while boys have face and puberty hair at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is less pronounced than girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair even occurs in infants and children of crèche age.
“We must be careful how we determine the true approach to puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be embarrassed to receive instructions from a paediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean an earlier than expected conversation,” Kaplovitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need proof that even when they do so before they do, this process is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing, stuck in Cheeta, is preparing for flight.
The United States aircraft, which carried out observation flights in the framework of the Treaty on Open Skies over the territory of Russia and made an unplanned landing on Wednesday at Chite on Friday, 1 November, at 8.30 p.m. Moscow time, will leave the city's air harbor.
The airport authorities allowed the flight to take off on fuel money.
According to the airport, the plane will fly to Ulaan-Ude.
According to other data, he's going to the United States.
A plane flying in Ulaan Uda reportedly landed in Zabaikal province because of fog.
Due to unpaid invoices, he was not released from Chita airport.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew, who spent two nights on the airport, reporting ITAR-TASS.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, persons on board an aircraft are not allowed to go outside the Chita airport; they can only pass border control at two Russian airports, in Cuba and in Ulan Ude.
The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992 and 34 States are parties to it.
Observation flights take place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, to promote the monitoring of arms control agreements, and to enhance capacity for crisis prevention and crisis management within the framework of OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the dead celebrities earn - MK in the U.S. MK?
The 2013 highest-income living celebrities rating was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was "overtaken" by the late Michael Jackson, whose post-mortem income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
The other celebrities who left last year's "earnings" are lagging behind.
The second in the list of the most "richest" famed celebrities produced by Forbes was Elvis Presley, 55 million in a year, and the line below the "Peanuts" comic book author, Charles Schultz, with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, former leader (25 million) last year, and musician Bob Marley (18 million) were included in the first five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein were also listed.
Igor Guliev's first boutique opened in Moscow.
On 23 October, the first flagman's boutique, Igor Guliev, was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulayev is known to the general public for his magnificent lux furs.
And now more fashion fans can appreciate them -- his first boutique finally opened in Moscow, which is why the designer threw a dolce vita party.
I'm sure there are the most beautiful girls in Russia.
That is why I am especially glad that my shop opened in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's how Igor cut the red ribbon and invited everyone... to try on some of the models he saw!
Jet manufacturers are fighting about the width of the seat when large orders are at stake.
There was a fierce dispute between the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for the violent confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-range flights to the economy-class passengers whose interests are not always the focus of the airlines, while the space allocated to them plays a key role in the assertions of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of a industry standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class salons, but its main American rival, Boeing, says that airlines have to decide.
The controversy is at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of increasingly large versions of their two-motor long-range aircraft, and at the event from 17 to 21 November, potentially record orders are expected.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft — especially whether 9 or 10 persons sit in row — is central to the statements on the cost-effectiveness of the new mini-airbus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economic class more than 17 inches wide, 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of her A350 will carry 350 people in economy class on 18-inch-wide seats, 9 in a row.
Aeronautical giants often exchange technical strikes through adverts in the professional press.
And now Airbus is reaching out to the public in front of an air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the beginning of a new advertising war could be by showing the financiers a slide showing three people in a restaurant clinging to each other, entitled “Would you agree to this?”
"Boeing offers long-range seat flights more narrow than regional turbo-wing aircraft," said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but the plane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when broad-boeing 747 set standards for modern long-distance travel, the weight of the average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The average U.S. male cascade of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that her competitor follows the 1950s seat concept, when the average grip of those recently called “reactive public” was already there.
Airbus says she ordered a study showing that an extra inch in the width of the seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing contests the Airbus figures by seat size and says that manufacturers should not interfere with decisions on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and convenience.
According to her, research shows that the comfort of the passenger compartment is not solely dependent on the width of the seat.
“It's really about giving airlines a choice and an opportunity to do what they think they should do to succeed,” says Boeing in Kent Craver's salon.
They do not want us to judge for them, which will bring them profit.
They know better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase side space, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is a race to order aircraft, estimated at at least $700 billion at cataloguing prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American to European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seating is exactly what warms up rivalry in the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing declare a 20 per cent increase in profitability in their last two-motor long-range models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared Boeing characteristics are partly based on a comparison of the 10-seat 777X series with the original 9-seat set of the 777 design series.
The gain in unit cost is decreasing when compared to the 10-seat arrangement currently used.
“The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more space and make his plane more competitive than our developments,” said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the compartments with a full 10-seat series for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense seating, which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“The 18-inch-wide seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is driven by a threat from the 777th model,” said Mary Kirby, an interior expert, the founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world’s jet sellers even carry roulettes to check competing plans.
All manufacturers also offer aircraft with very tight accommodations for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications to the salons, offering wider access points to some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say that its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “fly” but may divert attention from the 777X sales wave.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine can rob the smoking process of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti - nicotine vaccine that could rob the smoking of pleasure cigarettes.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from life-long nicotine addiction.
Further tests are needed before human testing begins, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Whale Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a steady flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralize them before they reach the brain, prevent the smoker from getting nicotine.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice that were not given the vaccine were "relaxed," and this is a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers say,
These experiments are described in Science Transnational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be made so often that they proved expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibodies factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers to stop smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Oleynikov: one third of the rural settlements of Podzhkovya
Vice-Governor of the Moscow Region, Yuri Oleinikov, stated that almost one third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region were entirely grantable
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 receive grants from the region ' s budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 received grants from the regional budget.
The share of grants in the budget of 122 rural settlements is more than 50 per cent and 83 per cent of grants.
As part of the budget, about 25 billion rubles are allocated from the regional budget," said Oleinikov.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Somitish, Lone and Pushkino - had more than 1 billion roubles in 2013.
The incomes of rural settlements in many areas are less than 3 million roubles, “that is not enough.”
The cost of maintaining the local administration in 88 settlements in Pod Moscow is more than 70 per cent, “with a decline in the quality of services”, noted Oleynikov.
He had previously instructed the heads of the municipalities of Podmoskovya to consider, before the end of November, which settlements needed to be consolidated, merged into urban districts or changed in administrative administration.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to that, the Governor of Moscow stated that the administrative reform of Podskovje planned to reduce the number of rural grant settlements.
There is also a request for the consolidation of municipalities in the Mojaysk, Kashirsk, Solnechnyk, Kolomensk, Lubertseh and Kotelniks.
This issue will be discussed in cities and areas in the region in November.
The President of the Ministry of Rural Affairs, Igor Brenzalov, also stated that some 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of Podskovya were planned to unite all in the coming Admiral.
This is due to the fact that less than one third of the 178 rural settlements in Podskovje have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 are grants.
Diane Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children.
Diane Arbenina doesn't hide how much she enjoys raising her children.
Although Arbenina is now particularly time-consuming in creativity and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to deal with Martha and Artem, not only spending time with them, but also entertaining them as much as she can.
In the past week, Diane has twice reported to her fans on her teaching talents.
First, she posted a picture on Facebook that shows how she teaches her children to read.
And yesterday, I spoiled the fans, showing you how I dressed Artem and Martha for Halloween.
We're ready for the broom racing! our first Halloween" - that's what Diana called a picture of her kids dressed in holiday costumes.
Which is not wise, because they, like any other Russian boys and girls, have something to do with this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce an “undefined sex” when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow registration of children born of hermaphrodites to indicate “undefined” instead of male or female.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the sex on the birth certificate unfilled for a time.
Instead of "F" (female sex) or "M" (male sex), parents can write "X" (undefined) for a time.
The purpose of this decision is to prevent parents from rushing into gender-specific surgery.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born of hermaphrodite.
Tripodie denies being influenced by Obaid.
Former New South Wales Minister of Labour, Joe Tripodie, will be a member of the State's anti-corruption oversight body.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi refutes the changes in the lease of offshore facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obaid, who had secretly held shares in three properties on public land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid had lobbyed several state ministers for the extension of leases to Serkular Ki, where the Obaid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obaid ' s secret involvement in real estate, following testimony given by the former Deputy Chief of Administration, Mr. Tripodi Lynn Ashpool, on Thursday.
In the course of several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the rent be presented for open competition.
The tenants opposed this and also wanted longer leases.
In 2009, business leases at Serkular Kee, which contributed about $2.5 million per year to the Obeid family, were extended without being presented for open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obaid, who, according to Mr. Tripodi, had urged changes in the Government ' s rental policy.
The ICAC decryption of telephone conversations included talks in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunne, a senior official who came to the port ministry after working under Mr. Obeid's leadership in the Fisheries Department.
“Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations the development of a commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley, Mr. Tripodi.
“No”, replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was being discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
A high-ranking administration official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli warplanes attacked targets in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night.
The official didn't specify what the target was, but he said at least one.
Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out air strikes against rocket cargo inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers of Division 457 may be tested for “trueness”
The “trueness” test for foreign workers on visas of class 457 is under consideration by the Government, as it intends to expand repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, will be applied to criteria aimed at preventing the use of 457-class visas for unskilled posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The paper presented by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McCoy criticized the Government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying that it might hurt Australia’s neighbours.
“Great statements like `foreigners at the end of the line' and `early Australian jobs' are a very unpleasant setback to a time when trade unions were demanding a secure labour market,” she said to the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was the white work that needed to be protected — and if some in the region had seen the echoes of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The paper presented for discussion sets out 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets with officials about trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the rest are under consideration.
If the “true” criteria are adopted, the applicant may be examined for a visa “whether the applicant is a genuine candidate under conditions where the applicant is a relative or close familiar owner or a person involved in the financing of the business”.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of visa holders in sub-class 457, since previously enterprises intending to sponsor a small number of workers were then employed by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of an alleged heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man ' s nine-year-old son, who had died in grief, accompanied him on his way to Australia and, since his father ' s death on Wednesday, was supported by a cousin who was also on board.
The Australian authorities rushed the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A friend of Semen Varlamov claimed that the hockey player was suffering from alcoholism.
A friend of the hockey player Semen Varlamov, Evgeny Vavrinyuk, stated that he suffered from alcoholism, was transmitting the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking”, said the woman in particular.
Recall that Vavrinyuk sued for beating a Russian goalieman, Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player pulled her hair off and beat her hands, chest, abdomen and neck after the attack.
Varlamov himself went to Denver's police and confessed to being beaten, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at $5,000.
The court did not restrict the travel of athletes throughout the country, but it did not allow them to approach Wavrinyuk.
He also faces imprisonment of up to six years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
Project HS2 involves the opening of a high-speed communication with Scotland and North England, with the start of Phase One in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project would “unite Britain”.
The Scottish Minister of Transport, Keith Brown, said that he was “excited” about the prospect of working on the plan with the British government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of constructing a high-speed line between London and North England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and reduced travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal for HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other."
We develop HS2 because the benefits it brings are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But this is also about transporting cities to each other; throughout the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better informed by HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: “Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “mutually” support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the overall argument for the high-speed railway across the UK.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, for the benefit of all and for the continuation of the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British Ministers next year and taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Thorium is a new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world are still thinking about how to provide for energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable sources of energy require large areas for generation.
Nuclear power costs both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste.
Scientists recently pointed to thorium, another radioactive element of Mendeleev's system.
It is found all over the world, and experts claim that its fragmentation does not leave waste that must be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia for the time being remain in force
Australian airline passengers will need to continue switching off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite United States mitigation measures.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided they stay on Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do so during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required American airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they did not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Department does not currently have special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft”, he stated.
This issue is governed by regulations that require air carriers to maintain security at any time and for passengers to comply with the safety regulations reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to the changes, but stated that it would follow the regulator's instructions.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the wireless entertainment system) is on our planes,” said the press secretary.
Qantas stated that it would adhere to the rules currently in force.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change them soon,” she said.
The FAA regulation applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit the passengers, and we will certainly examine carefully the decision of the FAW and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the effect of the regulation will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to mobile radio devices, as well as to review manuals, training materials, hand luggage regulations and passenger instructions.
“After the airline has checked and confirmed the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any height,” FAU stated.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn their devices off during landing.
In addition, the group recommended that the heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan is heard in Kubani's anthem of extremism.
The football match between Angie and Kubanyu resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of Krasnodar province and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Cubani anthem sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan, Ramazán Abdulatipov, on Thursday, invited the Republican parliamentarians to go to court because the anthem of Krasnodarsk province allegedly called for ethnic strife, in particular the war against the Basurmans.
Take the anthem of Krasnodarsk, which was approved in 1995 in our time.
It's a shame, and no one's doing it.
"You're here to think of as your mother, as your enemy, as we're going to the basurman for a mortal fight," "for the purpose of recording such words in an anthem, perverting some believers to other believers," expressed solidarity with Abdulapitov's parliamentary president, Hisri Shikhsaids.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
Now, the news is from the ocean, namely Syria, where, as we have learned today, Israel has attacked rockets of Russian production that were reportedly destined for Hizbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important condition of destroying its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement brokered by Russia that allowed the US not to carry out a military operation that it was close to this summer.
More details about the weapons and what this means to the Syrian President will be given by our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington stated that the Assad regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died of poison gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal that Assad's friend, Vladimir Putin, made.
Syria will renounce its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today's an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had decommissioned the declared chemical weapons factories.
The longer-term and heavy task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days were numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question isn't whether it's gonna happen, but when it's gonna happen.
He's no longer a legitimist, and he has to leave.
But Assad stays.
And it feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement has been described as a success in diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has made an impression of a person willing to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, the United States Ambassador to Syria has had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is unlikely to be helped by the fact that he was not killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's holding up for now.
And he's changing his weapon to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has established a separate Ministry of Construction and GKH
Russian President Vladimir Putin set up a new ministry responsible for building and JKH and offered to lead it to the former governor of Ivanov oblast, Mikhail Menu, during his personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Menem at the residence in Novo Ogarevo, and Meng did not refuse to head the new department.
The Spokesman for the Russian President, Dmitry Peskov, explained that all the functions related to construction and GKK are moving to a new ministry from the Minor region.
Mikhail Meng is the son of a prominent Orthodox priest of protoirie Alexander Me, and he graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petroleum Chemistry of the name Gobkin.
Since 1995, his political career has begun: he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergievo-Posad region; he was a member of the State Duma; he was the first Vice-Prime Minister of the Moscow Region; and he was a vice-premier of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Meng was governor of Ivanovsky province.
The pawn shopkeepers in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is having difficulties.
In a pawn shop at the Bendemir mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga lays a gold bracelet, ring, and earrings to pay for his daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is put there,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2,400) a month as administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where household debt is growing — is such that ValueMax, where it deals, became the third pawn shop in Singapore this week.
A mortgage on jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (S$1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawn shops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, slightly above the 15.4% offered at the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a branch at the same mall.
However, pawn shops have the advantage that they do not require credit testing or proof of salary and can lend faster than banks.
Millions of people throughout the region are therefore forced into pawn shops, as families feel pressure from higher costs of living and a rapid increase in household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and low-cost loans fuelled by free monetary policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families resort to pawn shops to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, identified the increase in the family's credit shoulder, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
“The point is that with rising prices, people in the middle and bottom [income scales] will look for ways to increase their income wherever they can,” says Song Seng Wong, economist CIMB, Malaysian Bank.
Recordedly high gold prices in the past two years have increased the rush with which people lay their personal belongings because they use the opportunity to get money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items laid in 200 city-state plombards are gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's put a gold chain on Grandma and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an increase in the number of clients using his offices in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in the pawn business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the office in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, executive director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 per cent of the S$66 million this week as a result of the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some creditors had provoked criticism because of high interest rates, she said that the pawnboard not only offered cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase debt directly.
“Clients plant items they already own, and the monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt”, she says.
The mortgage is gaining increased public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured financing.
And the pawnshops are not only used by those who are in a difficult financial situation.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices to lay gold bars or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy persons who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties”, says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number and status of the health facilities that are available that are important for the population, but the quality of the care provided.
The programme “Modernization of the health care of Tull oblast 2011-2013” and the reorganization of our city's medical institutions will provide an optimal health care structure for the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant women and pregnant women.
Thus, after joining with the gourmet, it has become even more possible to attract specialized specialists from the GUZ “NICB” to consult pregnant women with various pathologies, and to conduct additional hospital-based examinations.
During the modernization programme, the facilities of the maternity home have been significantly improved and modern equipment in line with world standards has emerged.
Over the years, approximately 8 million roubles have been allocated for major maintenance and 112 items of equipment worth 42 million roubles have been purchased.
The most up-to-date equipment is an intensive post for newborns.
In the operating room, the Cesarean section uses a sal-safe device to collect blood from an operating wound and, after special treatment, to return it to a pregnant woman, avoiding transfusions of foreign blood.
Modern equipment has also been provided with a clinic-laboratory diagnostic unit.
An electronic register is available at the women ' s clinic and the introduction of electronic maps and patient stories is planned in the near future.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, mothers and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg.
Chechnyans have been arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been under way since March this year.
Some 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes to a hotel in Strasbourg and then beat them and robbed them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old former convict of Chechnya.
David Alab's defender of Bavaria became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reporting the official Bondsleegi website.
In this dispute, he outpaced the winter sports that have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second was the skier Marcel Hirsher, and the third was the ski jumper from Gregor Schlirentsauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian origin helped his team win the League of Champions, the German Championships and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Bowl.
Arshavin's ex-wife is resting with actor Andrej Chadov.
Andrei Arshavina Yulia Baranovskaya, a former civilian wife of a Peter's "Zenita" footballer, spends a vacation with actor Andrey Chadov.
Julia rests in Italy with an actress named Anastasia Zaroada, her fiance, figure Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrey Chadov.
Photos from the joint couple walks are published in Instagram Anastasia.
This isn't the first picture of Andrei and Julia together.
On October 5, the Roadway published a picture of a couple standing around at the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Andrei Arshavin confessed to living separately from his civilian wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovskaya and Andrej Arshavin have been together since 2003, having three children.
It has recently been reported that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Arshavin's new friend was married to the corporate top manager.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmania ' s health
The federal government insists that a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania’s weakened health system will be supplemented by stringent conditions that guarantee that the state government will not waste the money.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plybersek, announced that the Commonwealth was taking “emergency measures” to prevent a crisis caused by the ageing population of this island State, higher levels of chronic disease and system constraints.
Funding for four years was decided after consultation by the Government with independent Tasmania deputy Andrew Wilke.
“The Government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” Ms. Plybersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for the planned operations Blitz campaign.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help bridge the backlog.
There is also money for unregistered clinics in Hobart and Lonceston to improve the quality of post-patient care, training medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health-care card systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will be based on the ideas of advanced doctors on how best to help Tasmania's health system”, said Ms. Plybersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would operate under strict accountability and accountability.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report on a monthly basis on where it spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the staff provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would not solve anything “unless they were followed by a genuine reform that would put Tasmania’s health system on a more sustainable footing”.
However, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to bringing the state's health system out of critical condition,” Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the State Government, these additional selective procedures largely compensate for the recent reductions.
But the federal opposition health representative, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s statement is “a solution similar to a leukoplasty.”
“The reason we're here is that the Labour government vomited $430 million from the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
When the state government pulls out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million dollars, you can't pretend that's good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plybersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Niklu's image of Denis Didreau can be boasted by exceptional performances and historical details, but it is also more difficult to understand than it should have been.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat, sent to the monastery by her family.
When she starts to rebel, she suffers extreme cruelty at the hands of the sadistic supremacist and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to obscene or sensationality, and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the story runs the risk of becoming a test for the audience as well.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons, says the monitoring team
Syria destroyed basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, declared on Thursday by an international monitoring group, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the outbreak of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day prior to the
The deadline of 1 November, established by this organization based in The Hague, for Damascus to destroy or “incapacitate” all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms for mixing chemical substances with poison gas and filling them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially an initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during heavy fighting on Thursday in the town of Safira, where experts believe the chemical weapons production site and storage sites are located, reports the Syrian Centre for Human Rights, based in Britain.
A group of activists who monitored losses through a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government side, the group stated that 29,954 were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-Government fighters and 187 were Lebanese militants of Hizbollah.
Also among the dead were, according to the statement, 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to a United Nations estimate of 25 July, 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought in Safirah for weeks with rebels, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The Boi stressed the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors in the midst of an ongoing civil war in the midst of their short-term mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied that it verified and saw destroyed all critical production and mixing/fuelling equipment declared by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both sites, according to Syria, were “displaced and ... items of the chemical weapons programme located in them were relocated to other declared sites that were verified”.
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the site in Safirah was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission this organization has ever undertaken”, said the Director-General of the Monitoring Group, Ahmet Üzümcü, in the commentary published by OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has confronted the rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad Government and its security forces, which are members of its Alavite sect, a subdivision of Shia Islam.
With regard to other events, Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the centre, said that there had been a heavy explosion on Wednesday at an air defence site in the Syrian coastal province of Latakiyah.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he said.
Worried by the conviction of the organizers of the Bali bombing
The 202 survivors and relatives of the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angryly to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators who had been brought to trial and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run, as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in building explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released within 15 years if he receives parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of massacres as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and dozens more injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist-related charges, including the explosion of churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person called a bomber for his reputation as a bomb master must be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of a mother in Perth June Cortin who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack by Patek and his associates almost ten years ago.
With her tears almost in check, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow the footsteps of the other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was detonated in a van parked outside, immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives only 20 seconds earlier.
After that attack, he fell into a coma for a month and died three times while connected to the life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek must share the fate of the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre — Amrosi, Muhlas and Imam Sadus — who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
Keeping him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds, that's not much.
Patek is the last party to the Bali attack to be tried.
He had been in hiding for almost ten years, but he was finally detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where American troops killed the former Al-Qaida leader, Usama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence data showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between the terrorist groups of South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he had not regretted how much grief he had caused others.
The verdict is in advance of the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“This year there will be a lot of tears,” says Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: "Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but not from a mobile phone)"
Airfarers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies, and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers must not expect changes to take place immediately.
How quickly this change is being implemented will vary depending on the airline, said FAW administrator Michael Worth at a press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAW how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for flight crew members and their installation regulations to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon”, FAU said.
Passengers are now obliged to switch off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain says "good".
Passengers must turn their devices off again when the plane is down for landing, and do not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, FAU stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Flying Association, welcomed these changes.
“When the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to do so), it will be a win-win option”, said Glading.
We are frankly tired of feeling “trusty in school” when it comes to this question.
But Internet connections for surfing, e-mail exchanges, text messages, or data downloads will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, reported the agency.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aircraft mode.
So there's still no "words with friends" -- an intellectual online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when an insinuating incident occurred: the actor was removed from American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was on its way to landing.
And the heavier devices, such as laptops, will still have to be put in the luggage compartment, because they can hurt someone if they fly all over the salon.
Cell phone calls in flight will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls is vested in the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Security Council, a national transport safety expert, CBS News, stated that cell phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigational devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cellular towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by FAU to study this issue recommended last month that the Government allow for greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, FAHs have been under pressure to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri's Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, claim that there are no valid security reasons for bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAH began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to information about interference for navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAW as resistant to electronic interference.
Air companies have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
The aircraft modified for the Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of ships are equipped to make greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Weert.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio signals much lower than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when scrolling pages.
But the signals become stronger when the devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to reduce restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company downloaded a whole airliner with its electronic books readers, and flew on it to verify the problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Passengers stated that he considered interference with the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only isolated reports from pilots that confirmed that the devices could interfere with aviation systems, most of which were very old.
The committee recommended, however, that FAU allow pilots to require passengers to disable the devices during landings in reduced visibility.
A group of tourism industry representatives welcomed these changes, calling them a sound step towards the passengers who are now using many technological devices.
“We are glad that FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Doe, Director General of the US Tourist Association.
Schools will be able to pass driving tests
Private companies with their own computer-assisted motorway may accept driving permits.
This is written by “Commersant” with reference to the draft Government Regulation “On Admission to Driving”.
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such motorways in Russia.
It is expected that students of these “privileged” motor schools will be counted on the results of internal testing.
In doing so, the State Inspectorate will monitor the completion of the examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 per cent of the theories and more than 20 per cent of the field are not served by pupils on the first occasion, the school will be denied privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for motorways contained in the draft Government Regulation will enter into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for two-wheel drive training.
From 1 January 2015, motorcyclists will be required to take the Urban Traffic Examination to qualify for category A rights.
Moreover, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers would be required to obtain Russian rights after the examination.
A bird transported by air to a safe place from a drilling rig in the North Sea, released back to the wild
A bird that had been transported by air to shore after being found in a depleted state at a oil tower in the North Sea was released back to the wild.
This water pasta was placed on a helicopter headed for Aberdeen last month, and was then released by the Scottish Animal Abuse Prevention Society (SPCA) in a rescue centre in Alla.
The manager of the Center, Colin Seddon, said: “This water pasta is probably a winter migrant from the North European region who has entered the zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It looks like the bird was exhausted and was able to find refuge at the oil tower.
He added, "She was unable to fly again, so we were asked for help."
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and to determine what changes the UK's wealth-makers and jobs want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on Britain, business, and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in Britain in size, sectors and regions.
The findings of the poll will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently seeking export opportunities outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India, and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU’s complicated institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from competition to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with a single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in the European trade zone, even 40 per cent of the large enterprises traditionally the most European-based companies agreed.
Last and foremost, our survey of business leaders has revealed that the obvious majority wants Britain to move towards a change of contract and a trade-based relationship with the EU rather than a policy-based one.
This result, which has been observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a “significant change” that will return to Britain.
The stakes are high — achieving changes in the contract and more favourable conditions for the UK will result in a 16 per cent shift in voting to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to re-examine British EU membership.
It also shows that business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back to the UK.
The best conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the path of closer economic and financial unification.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and, as our survey shows, for business this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels’s regulatory activities.
U.S. Special Services are listening to the pope's personal phone.
The activities of the Vatican are under the watchful control of the United States intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that U.S. intelligence has been listening to all the talks of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now closely guarded by Pope Francis.
His phone began to be tapped before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was also monitored.
What was of particular importance in the United States.
The intelligence service has connected to the cardinals' cell phones, who have gathered in Rome to select another Pope.
The telephones of the residence where the Conclaves lived were also heard.
American spies were listening to all the chief candidates for the pope's throne to prevent it from appearing in an undesirable figure for Washington.
Panorama magazine states that the "great ear of the United States" continued to intercept the conversations of the prelate until the end of the conclave on March 12.
In the United States, it is alleged that Archbishop Bergolio of Argentina has been designated as the future Pope of Rome since 2005.
American intelligence was also engaged in negotiations related to the election of the new President of the Bank of the Vatican.

The snowboarder for the Olympic bills was specially photographed.
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a memorable note on the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will take place this winter.
Bill numbered 100 rubles.
But on the web bloggers are already actively ironic about the memorable banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on 30 October, they noticed that the image of the snowboarder from the note could be found in photo banks.
In particular, in the free vault, a photo of StockExchange, which is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website MegaObsor on January 18, 2011.
It has also been used in RugGear's smartphone commercials.
The Olympic note is made in blue and blue.
On the one hand, there's a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other, a species of Olympic stadium and a hot bird.
The author of the banknote was Pavel Bushuev, who won a competition among students at the Repin Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle, and ski jumping, but that they eventually chose snowboard, as it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source of Izvest, close to the CB, the regulator is concerned about the public opinion about the widespread distribution of the image of a snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is currently studying the situation.
In the State party, however, the noise surrounding the Olympic banknote is not very disturbing.
Natalia Nikiforov, Head of State Press, said to the News that all the reasoning about plagiarism was ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the note is turned to the right, the photos on the network are to the left, and Nikiforov has been clarified.
The person in the photo shoot to create the bill was taken from different angles, then the final image was selected, and it was a characteristic snowboarder posture.
It also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist was paid for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is entirely positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill, plus for promotion, is considered by the executive director of the PNP, RusBrand, Alexei Popovichev.
It is difficult to prove the 100 percent resemblance of the images on the bill and in the photo banks, so it is unlikely that there will be any intellectual property claims against the image.
The Olympic banknote first appeared in China, with a memorable ten-yuan note released in 2008 by the Olympic Games in Beijing.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
The legal prohibitions made Russians drink less beer.
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
They assume that the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain the same, and that's at best.
Although the businessmen originally relied on growth.
This year is not a good year for them: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
The head of one of the country's largest brewery companies, Isaac Shepps, President of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute, “Commodities of Daily Demand in Russia”, which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed public market regulation.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already declined by 18 per cent, as there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewery in recent years in the production and circulation of beer, a little alcohol, and Shepps informed the audience.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable imposition of new and new illogical prohibitions, which are based on alleged alcohol abuse control.
The beer-war noted that many legislative prohibitions to reduce alcohol abuse were not particularly important, but new initiatives were constantly emerging.
Beer manufacturers have been hit hardest by the ban on selling alcohol in kiosks since this year.
"We lost 35,000 consumers immediately," said Isaac Shepps.
The brewers have two forecasts for next year.
Optimistic is the one Shepps was talking about: the sales of foam drinks will stay at the same level.
The pessimistic will fall another 2-3%.
In order to save their profits, businessmen are forced to move from consumer-oriented varieties to the "premium" class: beer will be smaller, but it will cost more.
However, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"My observations indicate that the level of alcohol abuse remains roughly the same," said drug doctor Alexei Sotnikov.
True, there has been an increase in the proportion of patients who use surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who have been addicted to alcohol-containing tonicative beverages such as Jaguar, while it was drunk alcoholism that prevailed 10 years ago.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford vehicle factory in Vzvodozk.
As the trade unions say, all those dismissed received compensation.
However, the issue of reducing productivity in the region is much more acute than the problems of workers.
A deputy of the ZackS region, Alexei Etmanov, stated at the meeting that about 600 people had been reduced at the Ford factory in Vzvodozk.
According to him, this occurred in September, when about 600 people left the factory under the voluntary dismissal programme, which was developed with the organization ' s trade union.
Workers who decided to resign voluntarily were offered “golden parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority of people left their jobs voluntarily.
However, according to Etmanov, that number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's what this is about.
However, in the next two years, the authorities did not plan to adopt any support programmes for regional enterprises in difficult circumstances,” he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs in the budget.
In Ford, this information is not refuted or confirmed.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as he shows up, we'll publish it.
Talks about cutting down workers at the Ford factory in Vzvodsk are going on a long time ago.
For example, the company's plans to fire 600 people had come to light in September.
The plant had previously stated that the production of vehicles had been suspended.
The reason in the factory was the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, industrial production in Lenoblast fell by 5.4 per cent after nine months in 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile phones can be used during the take-off and landing of the aircraft
The new rules for the safe use of mobile devices during the take-off and landing of the aircraft have been approved in the United States, and BBC Tele Corporation reports.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and the new regulations will be in place by the end of 2013.
However, Internet connections for e-mails and e-mails will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Because of the risk of interference with the aircraft ' s radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be prohibited.
Flight passengers will thus be allowed to read electronic books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before the regulations are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the perceived impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, the U.S. example, it is also possible to revise the current standards for the use of electronic devices in flights in Britain.
The "Russian Mafia" in the U.S. has finally established its new name, "The Brotherhood Circle."
This week, the blacklist of the "Russian Mafia" in America has been filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance has introduced three representatives of Russia, two Uzbek citizens and an Israeli into the Brotherhood.
One of the Russians was a famous singer, Gregory Leps, who is suspected of transporting money to members of the group.
In total, the U.S. blacklist contains 22 members of the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization actually exists.
"The announcement of the 'brother circle' is more like an attempt to unite scattered criminal groups," said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime, and Professor Mark Galeotti, University of New York.
In his view, the Brotherhood reflects a popular perception of the Russian Mafia.
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization”, quotes Mr. Galeotti from the American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Professor Liz Shelley of George Mason University agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
“If they work together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” she cites the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Broth Circle” was more united by a closer Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Dead Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zacharia Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Grandpa Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Grandpa Hassan's nephew.
However, he noted that certain individuals were not related to Usoian.
In his view, they were all more united by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the Brotherhood of Gregory Leps, the beloved singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, drew the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, which led to a decision on why it was placed on such lists, said the Spokesman of the Head of State, Dmitry Peskov.
In any event, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
The head of Gazprom Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field.
The launch of the Southern Flow gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Head Gazprom.
“Today, a landmark event took place: the construction of a Bulgarian section of the Southern Flow pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began”, said President Gazproma Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
The “south stream” is designed to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute between Gazprom and his partners in Ukraine, where most of Russia’s gas destined for Europe is located, increases the risk level for conventional routes, says officials.
Miller stated that the direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “forever” eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the Southern Flow at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should begin in other countries along the pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Sarat district, the driver of the Peugeot drove off to a crossroads of 115 km of the Odessa-Renie road and ran into a bus carrying six people.
This is reported by the GSS Press Service in Odessa.
The accident resulted in the death of a 31-year-old driver of a Peugeot car.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were injured and his leg was jammed.
The doctors provided the woman with the first medical treatment on the spot, and she refused to be hospitalized.
Emergency medical personnel also examined all other passengers.
The crew, using a crane, lifted the bus and released the bus driver, whose leg was jammed at the bus door.

Two YMCA officers have been charged with sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has learned.
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with sexual offences against children prior to the 2011 charges against a child care worker in Karingbach, Jonathan Lord, informed the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Violence.
But the commission's introductory statement stated that it had “never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Officer, Philip Hayre, was asked about one case in which YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case in which a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hair told Gail Fernes, the lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.
He admitted that YMCA, in its opening speech to the commission, also made an inaccuracies, claiming that “there were external YMCA tests that recognized YMCA as being in the forefront of child safety”.
The evidence submitted to the Commissions indicates that YMCA was notified that it received the second of the four possible quality audits conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hair, who joined YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed by hiring the Lord, as well as failed to ensure a clear understanding by the staff of their obligations regarding reporting violations of the child's security policy.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hair rejected the assumption that corporate ethic YMCA had prevented staff from reporting Lord's violations in the area of child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, put them on his lap, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with their mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the Lord's leadership and asked to be trained to protect her children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she had found Jackie Barnath, the custody manager of the YMCA office in Karingbach, who was the Lord's leader, “very scary and often difficult to access.”
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the explanation of staff members that they had been embarrassed to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord led them away from thinking about the need to report him.
Mr. Hair said that he had presented his view to the New South Wales YMCA Board that the lesson for the organization in the Jonathan Lord incident was not “relating to the provision of information” by staff members, and the Board agreed with it.
Mr. Hair stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges were brought was taken by the YMCA Director General for Child Care, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent evidence from being corrupted, but it was “overtaken” and the decision was poorly implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during Jonathan Lord's work in the period 2009-2011, and an expert on child abuse from the University of Griffith reported to the Commission.
He said that there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and monitoring personnel.
The hearing is adjourned until 20 December.
It's a fashion week in São Paulo.
She's considered a real star in her homeland, not just a model.
Although Giselle Bündchen had for a while left her job, was distracted by her motherhood, she arrived on purpose these days and this week in the Defill.
Her absence for months did not prevent her from keeping her seat on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world's highest-paid supermodel.
This time, she was at the Colcci Defi.
The end of the fashion week is usually the most interesting show.
It's kind of something that Leno Villaventura's stylist did.

Tony Blair said he'd take the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but he admits that return is unlikely.
On the eve of the evening, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after 10 years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of Middle East peacekeepers.
In answer to a question about whether he would return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair said, according to London’s Evening Standard, “Yes, of course, but I don’t think that's going to happen, so...”

Look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
The experts of the competitive events moving to Cardiff to fight for the Foot of the Year knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was prepared for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy who had taken his first steps just a few months earlier, this little boy and his pet Shetland pony Toffy ran through three rounds to easily take the prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple — the same growth — received high marks for their appearance, behavior, and style at an annual competition held by the Sannibank Horse Sports Center in the town of Radry near Cardiff.
When he came out to the public in the midst of men and women wearing elegant hats, he moved his hat and proudly spent the two-year-old Toffee circle.
The judges praised Fenton for his infancy in dealing with horses for years to come.
And Toffy got the highest rating for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffee for his third birthday last March, and since then he has been studying with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a beautiful duo."
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unknown people in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Vale in South Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been running horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "The public was astonished and everyone shouted and clapped."
He ran through the sand through the length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did a fine job.
Fenton is crazy about animals -- he likes horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
From the way he began, he will soon be participating in the Loshady of the Year — and I am sure he will speak well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibition said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together, they're a great team.
The judges commended Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and for the way they introduced themselves in the show ring.
They're assessing the coherence of the pony and manufacturer's performances - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper called for “to be reorganized”
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the front page a call for the release of the accused in the slander of a reporter, must be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The newspaper New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public announcement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yungzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a public share of ownership.
Now the New Express has to go through the “complete error correction process”, as the regulator reports.
The order for “correction of errors” came from the Guangdong Authority in the field of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that Young Evening News Group published several false reports about Zoomlio's listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The guide to the New Express has been disoriented”, says the regulator's statement.
He states that it has been decided “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yungzhou in the form of the revocation of his reporter's licence”.
He also “advised Young Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate the situation-related press and immediately amend the management of the New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the “New Express”, alleging financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlio.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-line calls for his release, claiming that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State television, admitting that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I caused damage to Zoomlio, as well as to the entire news industry and its ability to earn public confidence,” he said to the state-owned broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr. Chen's confession, New Express released an apology on the front page, stating that the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-level suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions in China continue to be widespread despite recent amendments to laws that prohibit the authorities from coercing someone into self-incrimination.
A U.S. tunnel — Mexico for drug trafficking equipped with its own railroad
Found one of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel four by three feet wide as one of the most complex secret passages ever discovered.
This tunnel, which has zigzags of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with invisible warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled into the tunnel, according to the authorities.
According to court documents, law enforcement officials confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when they discovered the tunnel.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officers, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major tunnel discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were found in Central Mexico after the marijuana harvest in October, which made it difficult for drug cartels to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of approximately 700 yards, equipped with rail tracks, from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
In Belarus, pensions have been increased since November
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November of this year and have been reported to the BELTA correspondent at the Department of Pensions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
As of 1 November of this year, the average wage of workers in the Republic, applied in the previous recalculation of pensions, will be adjusted with an increase of 5.4 per cent and the corresponding recalculation of labour pensions will be carried out in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 “On the increase of pensions”.
As a result of the recalculation since November, the estimated increase in labour pensions is an average of 5.3 per cent.
The average old-age pension will be Br2 million 295,000.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The cost of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of increased pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month from November this year.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of labour pensions in November this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be recalculated as a result of the increase in the subsistence minimum budget on average per capita.
BPM approved by the Government for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 in the amount of Br1 million,530, an increase of 2.1 per cent over the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the minimum working pensions, social pensions and allowances, promotions and pension supplements will be increased by 2.1 per cent from 1 November.

The British Police are giving Assange extradition notice.
The British police today gave notice of the surrender of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian “official surrender request” to appear at the police station, adding that if this requirement was not met, he would be subject to further arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sexual offences charges after he has exhausted his options under British law, when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand it over to the United States, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June, asking for political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland Yard “has given a 40-year-old man a formal demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice”, according to the press secretary.
He's still violating bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the police notification.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the U.S. for possible charges of espionage following the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic papers on the anti-secretity website of WikiLeaks.
Driver driving at 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs, fined £1,000.
The car driver was fined £1,000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
A 35-year-old Andrew Howie of Tipptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 highway in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take between his legs.
In the Court of Justice of the Court of Justice of Colchester Howie, he admitted the charge of driving without due diligence or care.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driving licence resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also required to pay £90 and an additional fee of £100 for crime victims.
A tax on foreign real estate owners will cause the London bubble to burst.
The Treasury has made a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7 per cent national tax rate for houses valued at more than £2 million and annual payments to buyers who decide to own houses in a partnership rather than as individuals.
To date, the state’s housing policy in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in fiscal year 2012/13, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Hubber.
Mr. Cooke stated: “With an increase in public debt on expensive houses and associated anti-evasion legislation, it is very difficult to argue that taxation on high-value real estate is understated regardless of the influence of an outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this step may lead some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London, or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class real estate is the top 5-10% of the priced housing market in the rich southwest London belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, and has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady annual growth of 5.6 per cent, but were overshadowed by a vibrant “domestic market” with high prices in the south-west, the north (7.4 per cent) and the east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on the way the dog’s tail moves are connected to her mood.
Early studies have shown that satisfied dogs waving their tail to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while alarmed dogs waving their tail to the left.
But scientists now say that other members of the dog family can notice and respond to these subtle differences in tailings.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that people in the left and right sides of the brain have different roles in shaping drivers that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we've tried to look at it from other species.
He added that, like a human, dogs have the right side of the brain controlling the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotion.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the multiple tailings of other dogs, researchers observed animals watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analysed their behavior.
We'll probably soon find out why their tails sometimes go in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, "We showed dogs videos of dogs, either naturalistic versions or silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw that otherwise, the silent dog moved his tail to the right (from the point of view of the tail of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the tailing dog), their heartbeat increased and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs learned from their experience which movements they should worry about and which they should not.
He observes: “If there are a few encounters with other dogs and often one-way tails are associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, vets, and trainers a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
An expert in dog behavior, John Bradshaw, an invited researcher at the University of Bristol veterinary school, said that this was not the first study to test whether the left and right side were relevant to the dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog and to the right if they look at a happy dog.
And in another research paper at Victoria University in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was pointing to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming alarmed, the opposite of Italian research.”
He said that the difference could be because dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
“As there is sufficient evidence for various mammals that the two brain hemispheres are being used for different purposes, many details remain to be clarified, and dogs are no exception”, he said.
However, given the ease with which their conduct can be recorded, it is likely that we will soon understand why their tails are sometimes headed in one direction and sometimes in another.
Arctic Monkeys is postponing a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's illness.
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February.
Pope Francis will assemble the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect the popes, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually be involved in choosing his successor.
There are currently 201 Cardinals.
However, after the cardinal reached the age of 80, he was no longer able to take part in the pope’s election — the prerogative of the group of 120 “electoral cardinals”.
In reporting this news, the Vatican press secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a meeting of all the present cardinals, known as the Consistory, would be held before the Sanctuary ceremony.
“Papa Francis decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from around the world”, said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of election cardinals was likely to drop.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it takes to bring the number of election cardinals back to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The consistory next year will be important because it will be the first since Francis was elected last March, according to Valero.
So far, there is some kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially for Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance”, he noted.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first chosen cardinals since Francis formed the Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who are mandated to seek ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad made his own decision.
“Now Francis has selected eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said that it was “fully possible” that Francis would seek the cardinals’ advice.
But we've never been in this situation before — this is the first time we've ever had it.
Valero said that the popes usually appointed a cardinal bishop from large parishes, but Francis is “full of surprises, so we don't know who he's going to call.”
GM calls off a series of new pickup trucks in the U.S. to refine seat backs.
General Motors Co cancels almost 19,000 completely new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to address manual seat back adjustment problems, in accordance with a notice from U.S. vehicle safety regulators on Friday.
On some of the pick-ups, the front seats may have a defect in the back tilting mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not meet the federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“In the rear impact of a vehicle, the head restraint may fail to adequately protect the occupants by increasing the risk of injury”, a notice on the website of the National Road Safety Administration.
The recalled models were manufactured from 1 August to 10 September.
The release of GM pickups began in June and is the most important serial vehicle launch for the leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider notifying the owners of the 16-day government shutdown, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of the year, according to GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM stock on the New York Stock Exchange grew by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
Obama’s Voter’s Cry of Desperation
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for change.
He says that Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to negate laudable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with the Obama-reformed health system web site, drone attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading an awfully sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in a time of discouragement in my second year of medical school and restore a sense of hope to me.
It's called The Vigority for Victory, and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patients' reports at night and go to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people, and performances could be breathtaking.
The victory in the elections was impressive, and leading news programs paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents kept every newspaper they could find.
A young team of strategists was supposed to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama's assumption of office in 2008, the level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Return is now a brute awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, changes have indeed occurred.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of a law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the rule of “Don't ask, don't talk,” the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and the closure of Guantánamo Bay, among others.
But after countless times, when I stood on Obama’s side, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I ran out of explanations that I could give.
I've reached a point of political despair.
The obstructionism of the Republicans cannot explain the authorization to tap foreign leaders or attack innocent children in other countries by drones.
He could not explain the collection of data on American privacy by the National Security Agency or the harassment of incriminators revealing government misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, without trial or the failure to meet the limits of State funding and expenditure during the presidential campaign.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the efforts made by the White House to silence the media are “the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.”
He has recently failed to justify the failure to develop a simple web site for more than three years after the law on affordable health care was signed.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have realized at the age of 18 that leadership might contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
Evidently, the election process is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and by such random events as the assassination in Newtown.
Nevertheless, all of the examples I have mentioned above show that they were to a large extent their own choice of administration.
And that's what's bothering me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, and seemed unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard for so long.
However, when Obama’s ratings fell below 45% this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 with the book.
It makes me long for many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton defeated Obama in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting on the causes of failure, he told his staff that they must return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
“I want us to return our appeal,” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I agree with you.
The views expressed in the commentary belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to parental leave.
MP Milliardaire Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to parental leave because his daughters may become pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnate, who has an unresolved dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, made this statement at a time when he was trying to move away from the question of whether he had a conflict.
Palmer's Allied Party can control up to four Senate votes, which may be crucial in deciding to lift taxes on carbon emissions and mining.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have had a conflict of interest and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they get paid leave,” Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer to be the winner of the race for a seat from Sunshine Coast of Fairfax County, with 53 votes over the vote.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral counting procedure in order to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should the decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system so that we can come, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 6:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
The use of pencil seems strange these days.
The Electoral Commission is exploring possibilities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
The 59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sunshine Cost and would take his new work “very seriously”.
Public office involves serving the community.
“We do not seek any rewards except to thank history for serving this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders in its foreign exchange unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is further evidence that global scrutiny by the regulators of alleged currency manipulation is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS officers to be removed from the unfolding investigation, which coincides with the LIBOR inter-bank manipulation scandal.
By refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulatory authorities this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this issue is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and our other regulators,” reported the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, informed individuals said that RBS had transmitted e-mail and instant messages that had been received and sent by his former trader, the UK regulatory authority, the Financial Performance Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave for his current position as head of European spot trading in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot tenders at Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to persons informed.
The UBS bank reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finnma said that it was investigating alleged currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world — the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland’s competition authority, Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have conspired to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, who are familiar with the situation.
Banks have been looking at instant messages and e-mails over several years in search of offences.
The verification news has sparked the activities of traders, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of revenue for investment bank trading units, which this year, however, has encountered difficulties in view of the fact that weak currency volatility has reduced opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by saying that a large and highly liquid currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily currency trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trade platforms and the wider use of domestic platforms by banks means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very low price.”
This news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of the traders of its stock trade division in the London Exchange this week after it had caused losses of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the issue has been localized,” Credit Suisse reported.
Supreme Court upheld Obama's Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama’s landmark health law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
After voting 5 against 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the Patient Protection and Accessible Health Care Act requiring citizens to acquire health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional under the Government ' s tax authority.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law and further held that the requirement of the Health Act that states improve the compliance of the Medicaid programme, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutionally coercive.
Twenty-six states and the National Independent Business Federation filed an action to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of the discord?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the Open Tribune, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
One of the suggestions was to ban football in the North Caucasus, because it's just scandals and rifts.
Speaker Sergey Narishkin recalled the recent events in Birylev and said that in order to reduce the “grade of tension in society”, politics and the media must be correct in their statements.
He probably meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they didn't want to limit fertility...
All speakers referred to measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and to measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which gave the debate confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biruljev were "a model conflict that could have been predicted," but "we have too many people and institutions to answer for these questions," and seven babysitters have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe has long practiced against migrants has, in the opinion of the public, failed, and we must look for our way.
Historian Yuri Petrov put great hope in a new, unified history textbook.
"There is also a need to create a handbook on the history of the nation's culture so that students in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyganov suggested criminalizing "rebellions to the dismemberment of Russia": "If you say on the U.S. radio that you must give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years' imprisonment!"
Vladimir Zhirinowski tried hard not to light up.
As usual, he blamed the journalists who put the sick and the acute national problems on the public debate: "There's nothing to say in the heat of the debate!"
The leader of the “One Russia” faction, Vladimir Vasiliev, immediately advised journalists to conclude a “chart” and agree to talk carefully about the subject, and then the same commitments can be made by politicians.
We have some 30 laws that regulate migration, and the general order is established, Mr. Vasiliev said.
As an example, he cited a law that placed regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-ethnic peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko did not share his admiration for the law: it does not have “a clear idea of what it is to adapt migrants, its mechanisms and its limits.
Therefore, the scope of these powers will be interpreted differently by the actors.
In addition, municipalities do not have the necessary staff to deal with such complex issues, the means to do so, and the guidance they could use, the centre does not give them ...
The head of the Duma Committee for Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special department with the formidable name “Ministry of National Security” to deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s headed a similar department, which was subsequently abolished, objected.
It's enough to have a special person at the federal level, a “minister without a portfolio”, to whom you could turn if you did.
“We walk on the edges, the shells are tearing apart, and it's very important for people of different ethnicities and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work should be supported by decent information,” said the representative of the RPT for links to society, Allvolod Chaplin.
There should be no neutrality on the part of the State with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones.
Here, Oleg Neilov took the discussion into a sudden direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, we have to look for them, but they're being pushed to the wrong path, the wrong way," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The footballer is beaten with the whole crowd, the flags are burned, the comrades are stoned each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another sport called rugby...
"They won't be equal in the world in this kind of sport!" said the philosophus fervently.
No one will play in rugby in the Caucasus!' Mr. Zhirinowski intervened immediately.
You're going to offer them another curling!
You need to know the national characteristics, it's like offering a Georgian Zaporozec...
In Jaroslavla, the members of the Moscow Club, during the game with the local club, were distinguished by their wild behavior on the stands.
Football has to be banned all over the country...
The head of the Russian Federation's supervisory and disciplinary committee, Arthur Grigorianz, reported that Cuban was fined 500,000 roubles, handing over from the Football House to Correspondent "SE" Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions have been imposed on the Red Dar Club for arson of Dagestan's flag by fans at the rostrum during a home match of the 14th Tour against Angie.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a member of the Russian Federation.
We've been researching all the available materials.
The Cuban spectators have been fined 500,000 roubles for their misguided behaviour.
Google, Samsung, Huawei filed patent claims against Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, whose price was interrupted at the Northel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which bought $4.5 billion of Northel patents, filed patent infringement claims with the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawi and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to compare key Internet search words with their respective advertising, as stated in the lawsuit, which is the basis of Google's search business.
Samsung, Huawi, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones operating on the Google Android operating system, which competes violently with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering an entire $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar Consortium, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, and this transaction was partly dominated by the Motorola Patent Library.
“Despite the unsuccessful attempt to obtain patents at the auction that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” states the lawsuit.
Rockstar requires increased damages from Google because he claims that Google's infringement of patent rights is intentional, as claimed.
In Egypt, the first freely elected President is sworn in
Mohammed Mursi is sworn in, but the day of its celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he took the oath to become the first freely elected President of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the shore of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We seek a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” said Morsi during a solemn ceremony broadcast live on State television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, for the most part of its 84 years of existence, was a banned organization that was targeted by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Mursi arrived with a small convoy shortly after 11:00 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court building to welcome the new President, and unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak, the movement was stopped only for a short time to allow his convoy to pass on the normally lively road linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi was ridiculed as a non-charismatic spare wheel of the Brothers, his personal prestige has increased dramatically since his victory and his Friday performance, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but also for all those who want to complete the 2011 rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mursi, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in a wooden hall, where he took the oath.
Mursi later went to Cairo University, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He received an official reception with an army orchestra that performed the national anthem, during which he stood at the stand “at ease”.
A military marshal, Hussein Tantavi, was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Army and the People One Hand”, which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as the mainstay of secular education, the University of Cairo became the wing of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where a rebellion erupted that ended the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and promised to regain the presidency, which was stripped of his office by a military council that took action from a deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take a formal oath of office before a court rather than before a parliament, as is customary, he does the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech at Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Another meeting of the Association of Engineers of the Tumen Region was held at the Yalutorovsky Motor Vehicle Plant.
The event presented a new line for the production of steel electric welds.
According to the business director, Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the steel market in Tumen oblast was carried out in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner.
It appears that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric welds per month.
It was then decided to modify the plant ' s profile and install the plant ' s production equipment.
More than 7,000 tons of manufactured goods have been shipped this year.
Investment in the factory amounted to more than 120 million roubles, told Denise Gribanov.
In October, a new camp was launched, allowing for an increase in the number of people.
The factory produces both a small profile of a pipe that is used for the household, small construction and furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
It is planned to reach the production level of 50,000 tons per year, about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - it is now 157 - and in the plans to purchase new equipment - an increase of more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is re-trained and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
In the coming year, a new longitudinal cutting unit of steel up to five millimetres is planned to be introduced, which will reduce the cost of the product as well as another plant, at a rate of up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is about to learn how to produce pipes that are used in the housing and utilities sector.
The management of the enterprise aims to close up to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tumen region for these products.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostromov, advised that more attention should be paid to the modernization of the engineering industry.
This includes forms of government support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its leasing.
This year, 150 million roubles have been allocated for this purpose, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The last commission to review subsidy contracts will receive documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the cost of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the coming year, the budget includes 150 million roubles, which can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
Five million will be allocated to fairs, three million will be allocated to energy conservation programmes.
Funds are being reduced to 72 million roubles for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is made in the southern Tumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostromov, this form of support will end in the long run, as the reason for its introduction was to compensate for the mining tax that the oil companies paid in the regional budget.
At present, they are not doing so, and subsidies are becoming direct expenditure obligations in the region.
In view of this, the Government of the region considers it a priority to provide direct support to industrial enterprises rather than to finance the oil industry through them.
The budget assistance will relate to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the emerging oil situation.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage for the industry of the southern Tumen region, and if it is abolished, it will be difficult to compete at the price of the Russian medium strip, where cheaper labour is available.
Moreover, the issue of the continuity of the new owner of the RV-TNC, Rosneft, which is not currently placing its orders in the Tumen enterprises, is not clear.
The agreement for the implementation of the Uvata project is due to expire in 2013 and no extension has been requested.
At present, the southern region ' s enterprises, which specialize in oil and gas equipment, are not in a position to form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes from the oil extracted in the Uvata region will flow into the region's budget or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the deposits.
Tomich will work 240 hours for an extremist video on the social media.
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced 240 hours of compulsory work by a resident of the city, who posted an extremist video on a social network, to RIA Novosty on Friday by a representative of the press service of the Regional Court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his page on a popular social network that was placed on a federal list of extremist materials.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, “Activities aimed at inciting hatred and enmity and at demeaning the dignity of the person committed in public”.
“The Leninsky District Court considered the case on a special basis and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned offence, imposing a sentence of 240 hours of compulsory work”, said the interviewee.
She added that the man fully pleaded guilty.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians a collapse in commodity prices after signing an association with the European Union.
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that prices in the country will decline significantly once the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
He announced this in his Facebook page with readers.
I can certainly say that prices are driven by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
With the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area provision, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will decrease significantly.
That would mean that prices should also fall.
“This is for products originating from EU countries”, wrote Azarov.
As for other products, the effect of the agreement on prices would not be so direct; it would be indirect.
However, there should be no price hikes either.
So the reports on the billboards, which have recently appeared a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is a price increase, that's not quite the case, or, to be exact, that's not the case,” Azarov summed up.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Biiske.
On 29 October, the media released a report that a kindergarten teacher in the city of Biyska had locked a child in a basement for educational purposes.
Investigators are currently investigating all the circumstances, as well as providing legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten staff.
After the accusation of the taste of Evgeny Vasileva, she spoke
Evgeny Vasiliev, who has received close media attention for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous press publications, both about the theft in the Ministry of Defence and about her personally - the relationship with former defence minister Anatoly Serdukov, her poetry and her addiction to valuable things.
However, on 1 November, the figure in the Defence Service case broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasiliev stated, "The original challenge was, of course, to get any negative information from me about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a blackmail to get me to testify, or I'd be jailed.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, we prove our innocence.
We're 100% sure of victory.
The interview suggests that Vasiliev may have been the most affected by what was said about her taste.
Probably refers to the statement made by the official representative of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that the collection of paintings collected by the figurer in the Defence Service case was forged.
Among the property seized are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident of her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world art.
However, the scientific expertise appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and, simply speaking, were cheap forgery,” Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they finally admitted they weren't stolen from the D.A., and they said I didn't taste well.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, some personal moments?
I think it's just a mess," says Vasileva.
However, on the question whether she pleaded guilty in any of the 12 criminal episodes she was accused of, Vasileva said, "No, of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there was no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
Moreover, in response to today's statement by the UK of the Russian Federation that Vasileva was avoiding the examination of the criminal case file, the lawyer of the figurenant stated that he and his client “were prevented from getting acquainted with the case file”.
What led to the revelations of the house arresting Vasilyeva, who had not yet spoken to the press?
Maybe as a woman, she couldn't fail to respond to a bad taste charge?
Or is it true that the reporters of Comsomolka, who claimed a couple of days ago that she had fallen into an even bigger trance under house arrest because of news of Anatoli Serdukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to his family?
A well-known military columnist by KP, Victor Baranets, in his article "Sirdukov returned to his wife?" wrote, "The spectators do not rule out that, after such a shock, she may become more conversant in interrogations."
Previously, Vasileva had taken on certain charges of illegal sale of real property by the Ministry of Defence.
Presumptuous troubles.

Do you think the travel agents went back because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and is looking forward to record income from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
This tourist firm now expects its main annual total revenue before taxation to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with the previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current targets are met, this will represent a 12 to 17 per cent increase over the record return of $290.4 million in 2011-2012.
Manager Graham Turner said that Flight Centre had earned 8 percent of the profits in the first half of the year and started the second half of the year with good performance, especially on weekly trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have record high returns in the full year before interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“This includes Australia and Britain, which usually brings us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business went well, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States has compensated for losses sustained during the seasonally weak first half of the year, and profits are expected for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre's stock rose by three cents to $38.20.
On October 31, the Barnaul police identified two playrooms.
The first one worked in the Industrial District on the Ice Street.
At the time of the audit, there was a game.
There were 24 automatics at the club.
Another game club was found in the Leninsk district on Anton Petrov Street.
There were 20 game machines used here.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation on Barnaul reports that administrative material has been prepared under the heading “Illicit organization and conduct of gambling”.
Tech's been removed.
In the near future, the evidence will be sent to the Industrial and Leninsk District Courts.
In Yekaterinburg, the perp killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are investigating a criminal who brutally murdered two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to the “New Region” in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, the day before the day before, in the Kirov district of the Ural capital, after a fire was extinguished in a three-bedroom apartment located in a residence on Ural Street, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found.
The victims were soon identified.
It turns out they're sisters, one of whom is a resident of Yekaterinburg, 44 years old, and the other is a 33-year-old resident of Orenburg.
They rented a burnt-out apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under the personal control of the chief police officer of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities are working on various versions of the murder, checking the alibis of previously tried citizens and persons who are prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose the women rented the apartment and where they lived before, what they were doing, who they were dealing with.
Schools called for greater attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature from 1914 onwards.
The examination will also include “external texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, pupils will be required to take a separate final examination in the language, with strong recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is expected to issue new English and Mathematics curricula tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically revised.
It will make changes to other core items next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of the OFQUAL examination will present a revised structure for the secondary school final exams, with a new system of grades and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Gove, said that there was “a broad consensus that we must reform our examination system in order to restore public confidence”, insisting that the school final exams would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent.”
Research shows that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools average 143 hours a year, while Singapore has about 138 hours of schooling.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time in the math schedule, the sources in the coalition said that large-scale school finals in mathematics, combined with an elevated score in the rating table, are likely to provide an incentive for schools to provide additional education on this subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be given to “real-life assignments”, including financial math.
The Hayhe tickets will cost the tourists 2,200 rubles.
From tomorrow, tourists from the Blademarks in Hayhe will start transporting ships on airbags.
For those who want to go to China, this means extra costs.
A Puma ticket is traditionally much more expensive than a heat drive.
As reported by the AmurASSO Reference Service, the normal ticket will cost 2,200 roubles.
The drive through the comfort room will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, this season did not cost the tickets: the pumas carried tourists at the same price in the past spring and a year ago in the fall.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rate of the Russian Federation is not sufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the growth rate of the Russian Federation's GDP to be insufficient, and he is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, reports Reuters.
We planned GDP growth in the area of 3% this year, maybe even a little bit more.
It'll actually be a little less than 2%.
Against the background of recession in a number of countries in Europe, it seems not very bad, but it is not enough for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and indeed, in order to develop, there must be a higher rate.
Now it's very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses, get normal loans at a normal price – that's the first thing you have to do,” stressed the head of government.

Travel on dirt, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwellet provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend receiving hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country -- just one per 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 major heroes to become the hero of the year CNN.
This man will get $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and become unconscious again, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jameth Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, his arm was only broken, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of itself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Georges Bwella said.
If we had the money, we'd have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
“It's not easy,” said Bwella.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one physician per 5,000 people.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could go to a doctor, many of them would be inexpensive.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health spending is private.
“The only problem is poverty,” said Bwella.
“And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded ASCOVIME, a non-profit organization, which organizes visits to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have provided assistance to nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others are loaded into vans, tied to rooftops with medical supplies and travelling across the border to visit villages in need.
It's not always their luck.
They've had to push cars through rivers and dirt on many occasions.
But when they come, they're greeted as real heroes: it's a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms the locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed an occasion for celebration, and Bwelle is more than happy to join the fun with his broad smile and unlimited energy.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people on every trip,” Bwella said.
They come from all over the county within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they walk.
Each of these clinics provides a variety of medical services on a day-to-day basis.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches, sunglasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually conducted in the school, municipality or home; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-op zone to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to light operating and sanitary equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers operate until early Sunday morning.
It's a slow pace, but the team's commitment usually helps support village musicians.
“They've been hitting drums all night to keep us awake and keep working,” said Bwella.
On Sunday, the crew members go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, carried out 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia treatment he received would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical treatments on weekends and work at the hospital, surgeon Bwelle also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second job, he said, that provided 60 per cent of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest was covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, volunteering for the Bwell Group.
He's either in the hospital or he's trying to make money for the organization so he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the US and Europe to join Bwell in his tasks, it is an opportunity for practice that they would never have received at home.
“We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold instruments for Dr. Bwelle”, said O'Malley.
As a second-year student, you'd never get that opportunity in America.
Visitors usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their food, transportation, and training are paid by Bwella.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He is giving his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is infinite.
For Bwella, almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling their father’s promise, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," said Bwella.
- And I'm thinking about my dad.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see how you can help.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's wire.
The deputy of the Bundestag, Hans-Christian Strebele, met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the interview, it was discussed whether Snowden could be interrogated as a witness by the Federal Attorney General in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor's phone by the U.S. Special Students.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, he said to Hans-Christian Strebel, that he knew a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, we must clearly define all the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, United States legislators are beginning to respond to a scandal surrounding US spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill yesterday imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the United States electronic intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all fields and areas.
This was stated to the journalists by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Maquie, at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, reported by Belta correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all fields and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, and we have therefore agreed that the public administration of the two countries will provide universal cooperation and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves,” noted Vladimir McKay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions and provide the maximum cooperation.
The Minister also reported that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, at which time the protocol had been signed.
The parties have developed a road map for Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims to deepen bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture and energy, as well as to seek new forms and directions of cooperation.
“The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am confident that the current protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey view each other as reliable partners”, he said.
The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ahmet Davutoğlu, in turn reported that during the negotiations, the heads of foreign policy departments of the two countries had decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
In the view of the Minister, trade between Belarus and Turkey needs to be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is untapped potential in this area, he believes.
Our relations have always been very cordial among our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
As well, all necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful operation of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey”, noted Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama refuses to speak about health care
Among the criticism storms, President Obama yesterday reversed his frequent, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are being notified to stop providing services from their providers, the Republicans have criticized the President in recent days for misusing American society.
Yesterday, Obama made some adjustments to his original public promise.
“Most people with health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he described as a “news-breaking” about shutting down services, Obama encouraged Americans who received the notices to look for other market options.
Most people will be able to obtain better, integrated health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
“You'll get better terms,” he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own could be forced to change plans because they did not meet the new standards required by the Affordable Health Care Act.
“Let me say to these Americans that you deserve better,” Cibelius said in a speech to the Washington House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce.
Sybelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable health care, said that the Internet sale site has been “seriously bad” since October.
“I am as upset and angry as everyone else,” she said.
“I really want to get your trust back.”
The irritated Sibelius dropped this phrase, which was captured by an on-line microphone behind her, to an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's House hearing after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives, Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she was obliged to participate in Obama's health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Siebelius to explain why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through Healthcare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt Agency has been stripped of media status for uncensored war.
On 31 October, Mosgorsud ruled that the registration licence of Rosbalt, written by Lenta, was invalid.
Roskomnadzor, for systematic and gross violations of the media law, insisted on the withdrawal of the agency ' s media status.
In the course of the trial, an unfortunate precedent was set: the court considered it possible to close the media, effectively denying the publication the right to put forward counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"?
The “Rosbalt Information Agency” was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognized private Internet media in Russia.
However, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications has (and is still) drawn up notes referring to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the force structures continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
While Rosbalt had a vast base of sources in various departments, it was also suggested that Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Čerkezov, was the head of the project.
However, the role of Chaplina in the management of Rosbalt is not fully clear: it is commonly referred to as the “project leader”.
The director-general of the agency is Larissa Afonina, editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not been on federal media ratings, either by citation or by audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the list of Russian media sites on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the website rosebalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), and about three million unique visitors per month.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are notes of the Kremlin's powerlessness in its relations with Ukraine, the death of a soloist of the group "King and Cock", pogroms in the capital city of Birlev.
The conflict between Rosbalt and Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when the amendments to the media law came into force, which prohibited uncensorship of journalists.
The agency found a prohibited lexic in two videos published on the website ("Jigit of Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot Defiled Oil Towers").
Further parties describe in different ways.
Roskomnadzor, based on the videos found, accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and requested the court to withdraw the licence from the agency.
In Rosbalt, it was argued that the agency's claims were unlawful: first, the rollers were not editorial materials, secondly, the words were disguised and, thirdly, immediately after the warning, they were removed from the site.
The agency appealed Roskomnadzor ' s claims to the Magistrate ' s Court, and when Mosgorsud accepted Roskomnadzor ' s claim on 22 October 2013, the complaints were still pending.
However, as early as 25, the justice of the peace had ruled against Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulyanov, had been found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and had been fined 20,000 roubles, 10,000 for each commercial.
Obviously, that pre-empted the outcome of the Mosgorsuda hearing - if you abandon the idea that the outcome might have been prejudged earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate Rosbalt's registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It is not possible to say that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency supported the deputies of the State Duma (the declaration to the head of Roscomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, signed 26 deputies on 10 October; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the CPRF).
The Head of the Russian Union of Journalists, Allvolod Bogdanov, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Gusev, and the President of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, stated that the closure of the publication was unlawful.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, Roskomnadzor’s authorities even provided him with some assurance that the withdrawal of the licence would not be possible.
The Rosbalt trial showed that under whose jurisdiction it is safer for the Russian media to be in Russia today is a big issue.
Syria destroyed the chemical weapons equipment.
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities and recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament has been completed by Damascus one day before the deadline.
Prior to 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare combat agents for use and hand over BBC.
The destruction of the stockpiles of poisonous substances or their chemical components itself should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, the poisonous substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors travelled to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on 21 August in the outskirts of Damascus.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repair.
The next milestone is mid-November: by that time, OPCW and Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of poisonous substances.
There's a lot of questions.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence services.
They would be willing to advise the inspectors on new sites for verification if there were grounds to suspect that Damascus was not fully open.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular forces.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community has demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement brokered by Russia, destroy or disengage all capabilities for the production of shells, poisoning gases and liquids and for the filling of shells with these substances.
Now that this phase has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already in the hands of the Syrian army.
It is assumed that the arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve and paralytic poisoning substances, flue mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
It requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a timetable for action — two weeks.
The OPCW Chief of Field Operations, Jerry Smith, told the BBC that his inspectors had “personally observed the destruction of the equipment”.
"They are no longer in a position to produce or mix chemical weapons further," he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found that the projectile and poisoning plants were either destroyed or rendered useless.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to be inspected there, as stated in the document, but the equipment from there has been transported and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the destruction of the chemical weapons infrastructure was “especially difficult” because it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said that the inspectors had not yet had time to celebrate it; they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that US espionage "has come too far."
John Kerry has shown a relaxation of U.S. surveillance tactics by admitting that in some cases US espionage “has gone too far. ”
The Secretary of State also pleaded guilty, along with Barack Obama, to being “on autopilot” at the time Edward Snowden was exposed to NSA spying activities.
These leaks have put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the government, have actually taken some of the things that are happening on the autopilot because this possibility already existed — both during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the cold war and, of course, 11 September.”
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that US espionage had gone too far, but he stressed that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone too far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to the people, and he is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted for good reasons and that his tracking operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We work in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions and the killing of people because we were able to learn about those plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, American legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US espionage abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the US, said the chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on European affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment at the surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency.
“In the interests of US national security, it is indeed important that Europeans remain our supporters of our common counter-terrorism efforts,” said the first-time Democrat Murphy, who chairs the European Affairs Subcommittee of the Senate, in an interview from Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger at these NSA programmes.”
News that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the US.
Other disclosures included documents released by Snowden indicating that the NSA monitored the German Chancellor's mobile phone, Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Klapper, defended allies' espionage as necessary and said it was a routine case on both sides.
Against the background of this noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit by members of the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and of both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
He said that the programme of the visit was still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the visit was to promote better relations, he said that some “good intentions” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programs they themselves have been using for years.
“As we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry must travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address the problems of hostility against the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence.
In the new members of public monitoring commissions, the influence of prison guards will increase
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new members of the Public Observatorys (ONCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the lobbyists of the Silovists will increase their influence.
PNCs are social structures that monitor conditions in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergey Magnitsky and Leonid Razzzhaev, the riots in the Copean colony - it is through the UNC that most resonant incidents are reported behind bars.
The fight between human rights defenders and the lobbyists of the Sylovists is under way to control the SNC.
At the meeting of the OPS working group on the formation of the PNC, I suggested that human rights experience be a criterion for selection.
"He was not accepted, and the lists were drawn up without establishing criteria," says Valery Borschev.
Borszev, the current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the entire Russian human rights institution dealing with prison issues.
As a deputy of the State Duma of the Apple, he drafted a law regulating the activities of the NCP.
The OP Council should vote in favour of the composition of the PNC in 43 regions of the country.
Fewer than 1,000 applicants competed for 1,800 vacant seats, while in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balcaria competitions were unable to take place owing to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to set up a non-recruitment kit for vacant seats.
The ONC of Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, despite the fact that the new 20 will be replaced by 40 participants.
According to Borzheva, in the current composition of the Metropolitan Commission, 11 human rights defenders and 9 silovists, and in the OP voting option, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to join the capital commission.
However, Vyacheslav Kalinin, a representative of the War Brotherhood, may be rejoined.
He was a member of the PNC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borsjzev believes that by appointing the Chairman of the Commission, the Syloviki will make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so that human rights defenders do not exclude a collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the advancement of the Sylovists is coordinated by ONC member Anton Flowerkov, head of the “Russia Officers”, an organization that defends the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies for traction," said RBC Daily Anton Flowers.
He denied that he was lobbying for any list and said that he did not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Flowerkov, he was not even interested in what list they were voting for.
He considers the disclosure of Borschov ' s information to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chelabin PNC.
Her former leaders will be suspended because of last year's Copea riots.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the management of the local commission had ignored prisoners ' problems.
On the other hand, the ONC Rostova-na-Donu can move from human rights defenders to silos.
From the new lists, a human rights defender, the chairperson of the local commission, however, was one of his opponents, despite the fact that he was expelled by the Federal Public Chamber in May 2013 for unethical conduct.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostov Commissions of Borszew consider it a "revenue to the Copeisk."
The discovery of hope by Toloconnikov did not affect the Mordovan RNA, which is considered to be “strong”: only one human rights defender wanted to join the new ranks, and she did not even accept the papers for the competition.
Nikolai Swanidze, a member of the OP Council, told RBC Daily that he had voted against the proposed list because he was resented by the situation in Moscow and Rostov na Donu.
He sent out his position to the other members of the council.
His PD colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted in favour because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Co-ordinated the listing of the ONC by the Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also a member of the FSIN Research Institute.
The Gryb told RBC Daily that it was not right to divide candidates for human rights defenders and silovists, and did not agree that the chairmen of the commissions had the authority to obstruct the work of its members.
The mushroom does not predict the outcome of the OP Council vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on 15 June by the Phuket Provincial Court of a false action following a report by the Thai police that a local taxi driver attacked on the night of Sunday, 10 June, while two other men held her.
However, the security footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up a relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
She was held in local police cells until trial.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term at the general security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuketta, not at the adult women ' s prison.
She is the daughter of a former Australian League player, Peter Tanks, who applied to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and waited for her to return to Australia.
“It was obviously an alarming time, but we hope that she will safely return home as soon as possible,” said Tanks.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the Krabi resort in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could result in the court extending her sentence to two years and forcing her to serve her sentence in an adult prison.
However, following the recent assassination of Australian travel agent Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its damaged tourist image, leading to acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at a presentation of his novel "Eltysheva", translated into French.
Let's remind you, this is his novel that became the finalist of four prizes: the Clear Field, the Russian Booker, the National Bestseller, and the Big Book.
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded a cultural prize by the Government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Senchin is a clear leader in the generation of the present 30- and 40-year-old prozacs.
Almost every publication of its hard, up-to-date narratives and stories has caused intense controversy among critics of all kinds.
It can be argued that the combined articles on the prosa and publishing of Senchin, reviews of his books and journals, create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
In discussions about the works of “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, critic Sergei Chuprinin says, it is mostly about what participants refer to as the term “literary” as seen in the present and future not only of our words, but also of our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow most articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere to be included.
Analytical and overview articles are generally provided in abbreviations under the headings "Abzazas..."
