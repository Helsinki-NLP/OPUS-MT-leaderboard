The Casanians in the Russian championship suffered four successive defeats, and also flew out of the Cup.
We adjust to every game, quote "The News" of the Mogilevian.
So each of us needs to think about the reasons for these failed matches.
We've got meetings ahead of us, we have to prepare for them and fix things.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably have fixed it by now.
But first of all, I think we should add to the component of unity.
I think we have a problem with that.
The Kremlin supports the ban on smoking on the balconies of homes
The Kremlin supports any action that will save lives, as stated by President Dmitry Peskov's press secretary, commenting on the ban on smoking on the balconies and flats.
Previously, Kabmin had approved amendments to the Fire Regulations prohibiting the use of open fire on balconies and residential rooms.

The changes will enter into force on 1 October 2019.
The breach is subject to administrative liability.
The Kremlin has a positive attitude toward any decision that helps save human lives.
"We know how many fires there are, many of them have very tragic consequences and social resonance.
So any life saved justifies such decisions," said Peskov.
First of all, the Spokesman views this as a firefighting measure, not a way to protect his neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not welcome smoking and is a proponent of healthy lifestyles.

China strongly opposes the adoption by the US of the Taipei Bill.
China strongly opposes the adoption by the US of the so-called Taipei Bill, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the State Council for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.
The approval by the U.S. Senate Committee on International Relations of the Bill also constitutes a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and a gross interference in China's internal affairs, noted Ma Xiaoguan.
He said that Taiwan was part of China, and the issues involved related to the internal affairs of China.
“We call upon the American side to clarify the situation, to cease immediately the promotion of the relevant negative bills, and to cease immediately to interfere in the Taiwan question in order to avoid further damage to Chinese-American relations as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait”, he noted.
China must and will be reunited.
This historic trend cannot be halted by any force, as Ma Xiaoguan pointed out.
TikTok hides bad videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Imagine China/Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok censored videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence, or Falun Gong's banned religious group, says The Guardian.
The paper states that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is promoting China's foreign policy abroad through the application.
Most of China's policy violations fall under the “inflammation of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok puts inappropriate publications in a context that fits the general rules, so that social networking does not look like censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls within the general prohibition of “criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The prohibition of mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under “the distortion of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of twenty “foreign leaders or statesmen”, including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sen and Kim Jong Eun, the Indian policy of Mahatmu Gandhi, the American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, the Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe, the South Korean President Park Kyung Hee, the Indonesian President Joko Vidodo and Indian Premier Narendra Modi, as listed in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by social media administrators and may result in the user locking.
The second category is not too strict: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules were outdated and no longer applied: “We now use a localized approach to the modernization, as well as engaging independent local experts.”
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says the co-founder of the "Producer's Centre" Rustem Bogdanov.
The Production Center is one Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All of the bloggers' promotional material, the Production Center, coordinates with social media representatives, but the user's material can be posted without harmonization and handed over to the Bogdans.
When asked whether TikTok could speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answered yes and said he had seen such publications.
The founder of Our Digital, Roman Zaripov, agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for TikTok users list in the user agreement: you can't post shocking content, discriminating remarks, etc.
But under these rules, you can throw any content that the moderators don't like, noting Zaripov.
Zaripova is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Under a user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
Social media administrators test their age with artificial intelligence: neurosetics analyze faces and determine how many years a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If the neurose decides that the user is younger, the account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBK, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow in September 2019 on the territory of WeWork.
The people of Istanbul reported on the earthquake in the city
A severe earthquake caused panic in Turkey’s largest city
On the last Thursday, 26 September, an earthquake of 5.9 magnitude struck Istanbul.
Thirty-four people have been injured, 10 of whom are still in hospitals.
A resident of Istanbul, Melika, admitted that she had had a panic attack for the first time in her life.
"I cried so much.
She was crying right in the workplace.
Later, it became easier, and I went back to business.
But I'm so ashamed right now!" said the girl on the "360" television channel.
"In Istanbul, there was a real earthquake.
I can't go back until now!
But in general, I'm fine" - shared his impressions with political scientist Jalan Ozgül.
The project manager, Celine, noted that the mayor of the city kept all the residents informed, but she said that the city still felt a little push of about 3.2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the communication problem immediately after the earthquake.
She told me she couldn't reach her mother, but the Internet worked "good" and she was able to send a message via WhatsApp.
According to the website kp.ru, all kindergartens and schools from which all students were evacuated were closed after the earthquake.
473 buildings were damaged.
The epicentre of powerful underground surges was recorded 68 kilometres west of Istanbul, in the Marmara Sea.

In Roshrovnadzor, the results of the amputation test were reported to the child.
A child in Rostov oblast was amputated because of a doctor's mistake, reports "View" with links to the site of the Rostovnadzor territorial authority.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm, and he was given a cast at the Zernograd District Hospital.
After a while, the child developed gangrene and was amputated.
The audit found that there were irregularities in the timeliness and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as in the standard and the amount of assistance provided.
The verification material has been transferred to the Russian SC SM for the region.
URA.RU had previously reported that the head of the Southwalsk Grand Hospital had been arrested.
The Russians were warned of false calls from banks.
In Russia, there has been an increase in calls from fraudsters who replace the bank's phone number.
This is reported by Commersant with reference to Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator provided communications operators with more than 2,500 numbers from which clients of various financial organizations had been called.
In 189 cases, the operators found a room replacement.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases the use of financial services was restricted.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the CB, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks had been confronted with the change of number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings of fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such a duty in the Communications Act.
The opening bank, Rosbanke and the Alpha bank confirmed an increase in the number of fraudulent phone calls with a number switch.
According to the Bilaya press, some of the information about the fraudulent calls sent to the CB was incorrect: the lists included numbers that were actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would cause disruption in the organization's work.
Artem Sychov told me that Centobanc is planning to create a database of fraudster numbers, to which the communication operator will refer at each call to check the number.
He explained that such a framework would require legislative amendments.
The US-China trade talks will resume on October 10 in Washington.

In September, Roscomnadzor discovered political advertising in Google, Facebook and YouTube services.
According to the agency, this happened during the Russian elections of 8 September.
The facts of the violations were referred to the State Duma Commission.
Later, Google announced that the company supported responsible political advertising.
In the view of the staff, it is bound by the laws of the country.
Facebook noted that the responsibility for enforcing Russian electoral legislation should be with advertisers, not with the site.
Roscomnadzor's leader, Alexander Zharov, accused the company of applying double standards to the political advertising.
Stoltenberg discussed with the Ukraine ' s Green accession to NATO
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and President Vladimir Zelenski of Ukraine discussed Ukraine's membership in an alliance on the margins of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
This was reported by the gensec during his performance at Columbia University in New York.
In response to a question as to whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg stated that they had indeed discussed the issue and stressed that his reply did not mention the date of Ukraine ' s accession to NATO.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance was obliged to meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, RT wrote.
Crimea offered an alternative to the NATO course
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, should instead of joining NATO, work to establish good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
This was reported on Friday, 27 September, by the Co-President of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Čegrinets.
"Pan the President of Ukraine does not have to repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should heed the advice of Donald Trump [President of the United States], which he heard with a sour face, and to establish relations with the President of Russia," said Chegrin to the journalists of RIA News.
The Chegrin noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian President would be able to remain in power only if relations with the Russian Federation were established.
Earlier, on 27 September, the NATO Gensec Jens Stoltenberg reported that he had had a conversation with Zelenski on the country's accession to the alliance.
To that end, he said, Ukraine had an obligation to meet certain conditions.
On 5 June, the deputy was pleased to say that Ukraine's possible joining the alliance did not guarantee a better life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
"Barcelona" is blackmailing Naymar.
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer, Naimar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the attacker's transition to French "Pary St. Germain".
The case almost reached trial, but the Catalans suggested that the player resolve the dispute without the intervention of the Femids.
Otherwise, they refuse him to return.
Naymar and his clever father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, had an interesting trick: by agreement with Barza, which the player signed in 2016, he was expected to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, he was in the SGW for a record 222 million euros.
Still, he got 22 million from the Catalans and now he wants to take the remaining 18.
In addition, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest on the late payment.
When Neymar's claims became known in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
Blue Granatov insists that the bonus was based on the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considers that the player was only a quarter of the 40 million euros and requires the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Naymar and Bursa almost agreed to the return of the lame player in the valley of Catalonia.
It's true the deal has failed, but the hope for a forward transition remains.
And so, according to Sports.Ru, referring to insiders, the club lawyers told the players that if the issue of financial claims was not resolved in pre-trial proceedings, it would exclude the possibility of a Brazilian returning.
Naymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for assurances that the Catalans would buy him back.

How to Increase Future Pensions and Not Recycling
It is possible to pay a pension not only to the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, but also to non-State pension funds.
The NPF is a private company, reports "Wolgogradnskaya Truth.ru."
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and eventually returns the interest money.
If you're interested in this way, first study information about the NPF on the Bank of Russia's website.
All foundations operate according to the uniform rules established by federal laws.
Pension points can be purchased by law.
The number of missing points depends on how many years of service you lack to calculate your pension.
This is a way for people who worked informally.
In addition, a contribution can be made for a relative, for example, a wife who is a housewife.
A recommendation for those who think about a pension at the beginning of their employment path.
Increased pension benefits are received by government officials, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the far north.
Take care of it in advance, so as to keep your retirement age in check.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, deposit money.

The video footage from the fourth power station at the Chernobyl nuclear power station appeared on the Internet, and was first published on YouTube by the Ruptly video agency.
It is noted that a group of 15 media representatives were granted access to the fourth BSEC reactor management room as part of a guide presentation on the exclusion zone.
According to Telegram-RT, journalists were there in special protective suits for less than five minutes, as the ruins of the blasted power unit still run out of radiation, 40,000 times higher than normal.
The accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant occurred on the night of 26 April 1986.
12 regions in Ukraine and 23 per cent of the area of Belarus were contaminated with radiation.
In Russia, 19 regions were affected.

Also in the exclusion zone, the filming ban has been lifted.
It was previously reported that the Exclusion Zone of the BSEC from the Belarusian side had been opened for tourists.
Tourists stressed that the area could receive less radiation in a day than it could on a plane.

Which club will take Pavel Mamaev on parole?
Football player Pavel Mamaev, released from parole last week, will not return to the Reddodar football club.
The former quarterback of this club may soon sign a contract with the FC Rostov, reports the Championate portal.
According to the publication, talks between the representatives of Rostova and Mamaeva are now in their final stages.
A contract with a 31-year-old footballer is expected to be signed for two years with the possibility of an extension for another season.
Sports Express writes that Pavel Mamaev was supposed to undergo a medical examination the day before at the Moscow Dinamo, but the check was not made because of the "undefined situation at the club."
Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamaev last week by agreement of the parties.
He has been playing for the Reddance Club since 2014.
With the team, he won the bronze of the Russian championship twice.
In the past, Mamav was in favour of the Moscow "Torpedo" and the CSKA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played for the Russian team with 15 matches.

A man with a samurai sword tried to resist a cart found in a garbage pile.
A resident of the U.S. city of Auckland Park, Florida, is under arrest for attempted murder after he hit his opponent with a samurai sword because of a cart found in the trash.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging through a pile of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, who was on an evening walk.
The last one decided to join the search and found a black cart among the trash.
Miller saw Beavers' find, and he was upset.
He thought he could claim a cart because he started digging in the trash first.
Men started arguing.
Suddenly Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his home.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and pursued the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers outside his house.
Miller took the sword out of the knife and started waving it in the direction of the cart thief.
Beavers told Miller that what's going on is on video.
After seeing the video camera, Miller escaped, but threatened to come back.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and walked into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw a strange woman entering his courtyard and taking the cart, shouting insults.
The police have already been looking for Miller for driving an unlicensed car.
The man was detained and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the U.S. city of Hardiston, New Jersey, the hedge fund manager had attacked a woman who had not been known and had wounded her with a sword.
He thus reacted that the guests at the wedding, which had been celebrated at the same hotel where he was staying, had not been allowed to light him.
Three-way riots.
"Moscow case" against the participants in the summer protests the further, the more noticeable it breaks down into separate fragments and loses its political fill.
The evidence of the “mass disturbances” itself does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to turn the case down, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the dismissal of charges.
The breakdown of the case should inspire society, but it is certain that it will leave the silos extremely irritated, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disturbances), Alexei Minyalo, was suddenly released without any obligation, and a few hours later, he was rehabilitated by the Criminal Code.
Minyailo had been arrested for almost two months, and several professional communities — historians, priests, and writers — stood up for him.
Since then, only two accused of involvement in the riots remained in the case (initially 13 accused): Sergey Fomin, transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samarimiddin Rajabov, whom the court extended his arrest until the end of December the previous day (he is also charged with violence against a representative of the authority, art. 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of the joke petition to join the United States of America.
The Videm suburb court in Riga sentenced the author of a joke petition for Latvia ' s accession to the United States of America, Denis Bartezki.
It is noted that the man was assigned 80 hours of correctional work and one year of probation.
"Health is not the most powerful part of our system," commented Bartez's judgment.
He added that the punishment is usually less than requested.
The collection of Latvia's accession signatures to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, along with this petition, the site collected signatures of Latvia's accession to the “Galactic Empire” and of the country's exit from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that Bartezki has been prosecuted under the first paragraph of article 82 of the country's Criminal Law, “Public Call to Destroy the Territorial Integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.
Prior to that, in 2016, the author of the Internet petition for Latvia's accession to Russia received six months' imprisonment.
He made an emergency landing at Khabarovsk by a Japanese aircraft
Boeing, who flew from Austria to Japan, made an emergency landing at Khabarovska airport, reports TASS.
A Japanese-owned ANA aircraft carrying 206 personnel, including 12 crew members, was on board.
It is noted that there are no casualties.
The people from Tokyo were followed by another flight.
According to a representative of the Rabarov airport, this was caused by a drop in oil pressure in one of the aircraft's engines.
It was previously reported that the aircraft flying from Zhukovsky Moscow airport to Kyrgyzstan had made an emergency landing at Samara airport because of a sick child on board.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to punish police officers for insulting them on the Internet.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation has prepared amendments to the Police Act to protect the police from the dissemination of defamatory and dishonoring information on the Internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal legal instrument portal, and the draft document itself had not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the paper states that it is being developed in relation to the need to protect the honour and dignity of a police officer from “proliferation in information and communication networks, including on the Internet”, defamatory information, including discrediting information”.
It is not specified how police officers are supposed to be protected from libel on the web.
The explanation of the document indicates that the provisions of the amendments will be applied “by means of individualization of the mechanism”, the Act on the freezing of posts that offend the authorities and the Act on fines for such posts.
Both laws entered into force in March this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public debate and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the Police Act are to enter into force in January 2020.
On 18 March, President Vladimir Putin signed a law to punish “exclusive contempt of the State” on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource of a violation and gives it 24 hours to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine of between 30 and 300,000 roubles is provided for, and for the second violation, administrative detention for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roscomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslav edition 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Novgorodsky District Court fined the local resident 30,000 roubles for posting on the network “two indecent records of information that offends human dignity and public morals and manifests a clear disrespect for society, the State, the authorities exercising public authority in the Russian Federation”.
Mortgage reduction date
Housing loans in Russia will decline by the end of 2019.
This was stated by Alexander Plutnick, Director General of Dom.F, and handed over to Interfax.
As Plutnik pointed out at the board of the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the majority of banks in the remaining months of the year will have another cycle of mortgage reduction, and the market average will reach 8.9 per cent, the level envisaged by the national project “Little and Urban Environment”.
According to the project ' s passport, the average mortgage rate in 2019 is 8.9 per cent, in 2021 it is 8.5 per cent, and in 2024 it is 7.9 per cent.
The programme provides for “the provision of affordable housing for middle-income families, including opportunities to purchase (the construction of their housing with a mortgage at a rate of less than 8 per cent)”.
Earlier in September, it was reported that one of the largest players in the Russian mortgage market, Sberbank, was planning another reduction in housing rates before the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens has not been sufficiently studied.
One of the most famous ones is pine pollen.
But phyto estrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain age-related diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, some cancers).
The known sources of phyto estrogens are all beans (the most popular soy), hops, leen seeds.
Many experts believe, however, that such ADDs cannot be a full - time substitute for natural hormones.
Possible harm from such additives cannot be excluded.
For example, their intake may reduce the production of their own hormones by taking too many external analogues into the body.
Vertennikov was called upon to revive the Kazakh Jennis.
Rothor's former attacker and the Russian team, Oleg Veretennikov, joined the action to revive the Kazakh Genice.
The club from Astana, which in different years was called Dinamo, Cologne, Astana and Genice, was disbanded in 2014.
Vertennikov protected its colors in 2004 and 2008.
"He found out about the action to revive the Jenis football club organized by his fans.
I couldn't stay away!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
It wasn't the best time in terms of results and funding, but I'll never forget this club and its loyal fans who have always been with the team!
The Munitepasov Stadium, where I scored my 200th ball in my career, will be remembered forever!
"Jenis" has to be reborn!
He's got a huge story and great fans.
I wish them all the best, and I believe that the city's authorities will return their home club!", wrote Vertennikov at Instagram.
The Bastion complex launched an Onyx rocket at Chukotka.
This is the first time the Defense Department fired a cruise missile from the Bastion compound on Chukotka.
Onyx launched at a distance of 350 kilometres, and 200 of them flew over land, a record for this type of missile.
Some 10 battleships and vessels of the Pacific fleet, as well as naval aircraft, provided security for the shooting and reported to the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation.
The Bastion complexes have never been used in Chukotka before.
The Hydromethoscent Centre called the right people's signs.
In Russia, there are many people’s receptions by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydromettic Center checked all the signs that were supposed to work.
Meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, though, in the short term.
As Russian Hydromethod Center's scientific head Roman Wilfund has said, if the sun is red during the setting, the next day will indeed be a good day, as our ancestors have pointed out.
And if the sky shines white, it will rain the next day.
The second working sign is based on bird surveillance.
It's more common to talk about swabs, if they fly low, it's usually in the rain.
It's easy to explain -- when the air humidity is high, the moths get their wings wet, and the feathers have to drop to hunt insects, says TASS.
There are people on different continents.
Sour Day is a traditional popular holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
On that day, it is thought that you should watch a trumpet climbing out of your hole to determine the time of spring.
Unidentified oil spots were found on the beaches of northeast Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in northeast Brazil.
Contaminated areas were scattered 2,000 miles [2,000 km] of the coastline.
Reports of the first oil slicks discovered began on 2 September.
However, each day until Thursday, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Environmental Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out they're all identical and it's crude oil.
At the Petrobras State Oil Corporation, which had been sent to analyse the samples found, they stated that they did not correspond to the oil extracted from the fields on Brazilian soil.
"It's dense oil.
It could be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it hit the ocean flow," told the Brazilian news portal G1, the coordinator of the oil union of the States of Pernambuco and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches, four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmentalists discovered nine sea turtles covered with oil film.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environmental Institute, together with Petrobras, will start cleaning contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the institute advises tourists and local residents to bypass the oil stains and report all the spots found.
Medvedev has commissioned a review of the standards for general stores.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has instructed Rosmesnadzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Prompromprogue, together with the business ombudsman and the business community, to review sanitary and epidemiological rules and standards for the general catering organizations.
They will also have to consider a transition to the requirements of the Eurasian Economic Union ' s technical regulations for the management of dietary food.
The agency's proposals are due to be submitted to the Government by 15 October at the latest, as stated in the list of requests from Mr. Medvedev on the 11 September “Dialog” programme on the “Russia 24” television channel.
In addition, Mr. Medvedev has instructed all the above-mentioned agencies, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals for an experiment to limit control activities for the catering organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad region, effective 1 January 2020.
The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economic Affairs is mandated to submit to the Government, before 11 November, a bill amended by the CAP to apply the administrative suspension for violation of the requirements for the provision of food which has caused health damage.
In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Economics, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance should consider gradually moving from 2021 to a consumer basket, based on a basic set of products that would allow for a healthy diet.
Let's remind you that the business community has been talking about outdated requirements since the closing of one café from the UnderSone network.
The business community demanded the abolition of the existing San Pines, and Rosmesnadzor announced the joint development of new ones.
Thirty-three departments are on the list.
In the meantime, Rosexplaznadzor intends to reduce the number of sanitary regulations by 40 times by 2021.
At present, the operatives are in possession of information on three thefts involving the detainee.
A man was employed in the Tula district of Skuratov.
He stole batteries and car magnets from cars.
Of the two vehicles, VAZ-2106 and VAZ-2107, the kidnapper took the batteries, allegedly for further sale.
"And from another VAZ-2107 vehicle for the same purpose, the intruder took the car magnetol and the sabwoofer," reported to the U.S.A.A. in the Tull oblast.
The intruder probably intended to resell.
A 26-year-old unemployed person is currently in detention.
Russians have nothing to spare - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Valentine's Federation Council, Matvienko, considers that Russians do not have sufficient savings to make the draft law on the guaranteed pension product fully operational in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions from personal savings is quite common in the world.
It's another matter, how timely we have it.
“In my view, a large proportion of the population now has incomes, from which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pensions in the future”, said V. Matvienko.
The Russians, in the opinion of the Speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and calculation of pensions, as “the constant changes in this field have completely confused them”.
This does not mean that I am opposed to improving the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social State, and we must do everything we can to ensure that pensions and social security for citizens improve.
But steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities,” said V. Matvienko “RIA News”.
The head of the SF stressed that if the initiative (the draft law on a guaranteed pension product) were to evolve, several basic principles, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and State responsibility for ensuring the security of pension savings, should necessarily be provided.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that a draft law on the Guaranteed Pension Product (SPP) would be sent for negotiation.
Among its main elements are the purely voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, the guarantee of the security of long-term pension savings of citizens by the State, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax incentives for businesses and tax deductions for citizens.

Sony owns the movie hero's rights.
She rented them for Marvel's films, which belongs to Disney.

At the same time, Faigi recalled that Sony was also creating his own boned, built around Spider-Man.
"So it happens that he's the only superpowered hero in the same place.
So while Sony continues to develop his own Spidey universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he noted.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account an excerpt from "The Wall Street Wolf" in which the hero Leonardo de Caprio screams, "I'm not leaving!"
Information on conflicts between companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to get half the cash from Spider-Man films, provided both companies paid half the cost of painting.
But it didn't work out for Sony.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from Marvel's cozy house has provoked anger among many loyal fans.
The details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated, "We have been very cooperative for the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many fans [the Spider-Man].
We're glad we can go forward together."

Vinnick became the only Ukrainian member of the project.
In the press service, the singer was previously told that the artist was involved in a project in support of the International Day of Peace, which was celebrated on 21 September, and that his patriotic position did not change.
Let's remind you, there's been a wave of resentment on the network.
The video itself is called a mockery.
How can artists who have visited occupied Crimea, who support Putin’s policy, who waged a war on Donbass, where almost every day people die, talk about peace?
Four people have been convicted of a series of thugs in Khabarovsk.
In Khabarovsk, the court sentenced four residents of the village of Friendba, who for two years robbed the collaborators Cosmos and Raduga in the Black River area.
This is reported by the IA on 27 September, "The Chabarovsk Province Today."
The criminal group included previously unconvicted men aged 31 and 37 and two brothers aged 21 and 24.
It was found that the instigator of the crime was the older brother who had served as a youth in a juvenile colony.
He robbed nine houses on his own, and the rest of them got involved later.
The damage to each of the thefts ranged from 3,000 to 21,000 roubles.
The criminals took away furnaces, refrigerators, curtains, buckets, gas cylinders, chairs, tombs, and many other items.
They were apprehended by security alarms in the last house.
The defendants were found guilty of theft with unlawful entry into the home, causing significant damage to a group of persons by collusion.
“Brothers are sentenced to three years' imprisonment of six months in a general-regime colony, two other defendants to two years' imprisonment of 10 months and six months' suspended imprisonment of one year”, cited by the Senior Assistant Prosecutor of the Khabarovsky District, Julia Vasiljeva.

In September 2019, the court granted the application for parole by athletes, with the exception of Prostasovsky.
The first battles according to Alexander Emelianenko's rules will take place on November 29th.
The first battles of the MMA by the rules that Alexander Emelianenko invented will take place in Moscow on November 29, at the Undercard of the Boxing Fight between Emelianenko and the Strongman Michael Kolelev.
We've lost our fights in the sights, told Emelianenko in an interview with SA.
There's no one to look at.
So I came up with a new kind of mixed competition, Universal World Fight.
The rules are three different rounds.
MMA is a sport where all the martial arts are collected.
A mixed-style fighter must be able to do everything - and work in a bar, and fight, and work in a desk.
The first round is just the shock machine at the counter.
The second round is only a struggle, and the time for the reception is limited to 30 seconds.
Round three, all allowed.
When's the first tournament going on according to the rules you've invented?
November 29th.
In the undercard of our fight with Cokelev.
But we don't know exactly how many fights we're going to have.

Trade with Russia is not just a tank.
The trade between Russia and India can be doubled because of the geopolitical situation.
The Deputy Director of the Confederation of the Indian Industry, Manish Kumar, presented this at the Fourth Commemorative Forum of Small and Medium Business Regions of the SCO and BRICS.
It is important for us to learn from the SCO and BRICS countries, including Russia, a guest from New Delhi.
- In our confederation, 9,000 direct members and 300,000 partner companies from 130 countries.
All of this is a small and medium-sized business that cooperates with the countries of the Shanghai Organization.
And we are not standing on the ground, but we are developing, with all these sanctions against Russia and the geopolitical situation in general only helping us all to grow.
Our bilateral trade now exceeds $10 billion, but these figures can be doubled.
First and foremost, through new technologies in the fields of health, artificial intelligence and robotics.
Our trade is not just a tank and a heavy industry.
According to Manish Kumar, India has already established its first contacts with modern Russian centres.
For example, a delegation from New Delhi and other cities recently visited Skolkovo and Innopolis.
We have signed a memorandum to create systems in which we can build our modern business.
Because entrepreneurship is not a whim, it's a necessity.
The necessary step towards economic well-being.
We need to expand, attract small and medium-sized businesses, and together with Russia, China and other countries, we will certainly do so, emphasized by the Indian industrialist.
Let us recall that Ufa hosts the Small and Medium Business Forum of the SCO and BRICS regions for the fifth time in a row.

As part of a working visit to Tobolsk, the Governor of the Tumen region, Alexander Moor, took part in the inauguration of the Sokolovsk water abstract after reconstruction.
It now has a capacity of 25,000 cubic metres per day.
The water abstraction was rebuilt as part of the federal Clean Water Project of the Ecology National Project.
The authorities were assisted by investors: the Sokolovsk water abstraction was another example of the use of the private-public partnership mechanism.
The Tumen region has unique experience in the field of federal cooperation, regional authorities, local administrations and private investors.
New artesian wells appeared at the site.
They had pumping stations built above them.
The water treatment and decontamination facilities were rebuilt.
As a result, the Sokolovsk water abstraction will provide the Tobolaks with quality drinking water.
Sokolovsky's and Zhukovski's water abstracts are planned.
Then Tobolsk will be able to completely switch to underground water sources.
In Vagay, water treatment plants will be expanded
At the Congress, Trump and Zelensky had a Russian trail.
In the lower house of the U.S. Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of involvement in the scandal caused by the telephone conversation between the head of the White House, Donald Trump, and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenski.
The assumption that the Russians might somehow be behind this story was made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, transmitting MSNBC News.
“Russia, I believe, has attached a hand to this,” said the Democrat, but did not comment further.
The Pelosi-led Democrats, who hold the majority in the House, have previously announced the initiation of impeachment against the President.
This happened after Trump was complained about by an intelligence informant.
The informant suspected that Trump had put pressure on his interlocutor in a conversation with Zelensky in July to take action against the son of former Vice-President Joseph Biden, the latter of which could become Trump’s contestant in the elections in a year.
The White House had to give congressmen and the public a transcript of a scandalous conversation.

The expert told me why we should drop the tea in the bags.
A group of Canadian scientists from McGill University discovered that in five minutes more than 10 billion microplastic particles are released into a cup of tea.
A food safety expert, Elizabeth Tikhonov, said, can also add sawdust particles to the packaged drink.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be shown on the package.
The sawdusts are not thrown away at the end of the season, so they may end up in tea.
"More than that, the bags don't always include the tea plants," said Tikhonova.
She said that it would be better not to use such a drink for the levy of tea, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of packed tea was not only in the composition but also in the method of producing it - microparticles were heated to high temperatures, which could lead to the release of harmful substances.
"The best way to buy pure green or black tea is to have the least extra in this drink," the expert pointed out.

Regionals were invited to share business support secrets
On 27 September, the President of the Federation Economic Policy Council Committee, Andrei Kutepov, sent a letter to the Minister for Economic Development, Maxim Oreshkin, and the Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, inviting him to express his position on the initiatives of Federation entities to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It's time to build cross-regional ties.
The Council of the Federation Economic Policy Committee summarized the information received from the regions on their business development and legalization programmes for self-employed persons, as well as on the outcomes of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions briefed the senators on the problems of SME development and put forward proposals to improve existing legislation.
“To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently established, with the result that the business community in all regions of the senatorial visit has identified the lack of information on regional business development programmes in general throughout the country”, said Andrey Kutepov.
In an annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive regional developments in the legalization of self-employment and a summary of the proposals and issues from the regions (available in the editorial).
In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions have also been sent to the heads of the regional executive branch.
The exchange of information on successful developments in the regions could stimulate the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange would be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” said the Senator in the Parliamentary Gazette.
Useful experience
Programmes to support small and medium-sized businesses are now in place and are operating successfully in many regions of the country.
For example, there is an Entrepreneurship Support Centre in the Vologd region, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In Ivanovsk oblast, a business support system has been developed to implement the principle of a single window through multifunctional centres.
In Krasnodar province, grants are provided to start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives from the provincial budget.
The Orlovsk region has a cluster development centre.
The Amura region of the federal project “Acceleration of Small and Medium Enterprises” provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators based on active non-State coworkers from the federal budget.
A number of other regions have special support measures for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed people continue to get out of the shadows.
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of legislative changes should be made in order to better support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the archangelic region proposed that the term “self-employment” should be replaced by “business activities”, as it is “most consistent with the content of the public service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In Ivanovsk oblast, amendments are considered necessary to expand the list of activities of self-employed citizens, including activities for the repair and repair of residential buildings, day-to-day construction and physical training.
The Brian region considers it important to strengthen the control of malpractice dairy producers through the Mercury veterinary system.
And in the Kostrm and Magadian regions, the concept of social entrepreneurship and support for social entrepreneurship is advocated in the legal and regulatory field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of government support programmes for small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of government support programmes for small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills”, assured by Andrey Kutepov.
The airline helped passengers avoid having to live with crying children
Japan Airlines (JAL) launched a new function: when booking seats on the plane, you can now find out where the little kids will be sitting.
Now, if you want to live with them, you can avoid them.
The Japanese airline Japan Airlines (JAL) has been able to use the new option to avoid unwanted neighborhoods with small children.
The air carrier has started a function that can track where the children will be sitting.
Passengers will be able to see a picture of the child ' s head in places occupied by children between the ages of eight days and two years during the course of booking.
Thus, those who do not want to fly next to the babies because of the possible inconvenience of their weeping can travel as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the services of the airline were thrilled by the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the users complained that he was flying from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and he had three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested the introduction of “adult-only” flights, expressing his willingness to pay more for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that they would now try to always choose Japan Airlines for their travels, as they saw nothing pleasant about flying next to a crying child in a closed space.
Previously, a woman who traveled with a baby tried to give her companions the pleasure of a flight from Seoul to San Francisco.
She prepared a bag of candy for each of the 200 passengers, each containing an apology note.
Did Oleg Tabakov's train enter the metro?
If you regularly use the Kaleusko-Rija line (as most of the people of Konykov do), you will be surprised.

By the way, from Konykov, it's convenient to ride performances that play on the new stage of the theater (it's on the Suhariev Square, near the subway of Suharievskaya).
As explained to us in the Moscow Metropolitan Press Service, “the external design of the subject train uses images of fragments of the glass of the new scene and features the portraits of Oleg Tabakov in landmark images he has created in theatre, cinema and cartoons”.
The train talks about his family, the play "Matrosskaya Silence", which started a lot of life in the theatre, the Tabakerka itself, and the directorship.
On the walls of the wagons you can see rare archival images and film footage.

Pavel Ustinov joined the pickets in support of the "Moscow business"
Acter Pavel Ustinov joined a series of single pickets, "Free All", which are held on Friday outside the office of the President of the Russian Federation at the Old Square in Moscow, and is transmitted by Interfax correspondent.
The picket series began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and has since continued every day.
At present, the participants in the action, in exchange for each other, are standing in their hands with a poster labelled “Freedom for all” and the names of those convicted and arrested after uncoordinated meetings in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, on the poster the names of Egor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Danil Runelic, Evgenia Kovalenko, Constantine Kotov, Ivan Podkopev, Aydar Hubadulin, Alexei Minyilo, Sergey Fomin, Samariiddin Rajabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Edward Kleinevsky, Vladislav Sinica.
On 16 September, the Tver Court of Moscow sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to a 3.5-year-old general-regime colony on charges of violence against an OMON combatant Rosgwardia on 3 August in the centre of Moscow (art. 318, para.
Since then, on 20 September, at the request of the Attorney-General ' s Office, the court changed the detention measure from detention to a non-removal subscription.
Thus, the petition for the release of Ustinov has gained more than 112,000 signatures in 24 hours.
The theater and film artists started a flash mob in support of a colleague.
In order to participate in a single picket in solidarity with the actor, on September 18, a queue was set up on the Old Square.
The case was called for by human rights defenders, journalists, scholars, teachers, doctors, Orthodox priests.
According to Interfax, Sister Ustinova Julia, her brother does not plan to speak at the 29 September rally in the capital in support of the members of the Moscow case.
The delivery of the "sanctions" to Russia has fallen 100 times.
In the Russian Government, agricultural and food supplies to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo have been estimated to have decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019, compared with 3 million 4422,000 tons in the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.
However, the value of imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4,975.5 million, respectively.
This is the supply of goods that have not been embargoed.
As indicated in the report, imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia have compensated for the volume of prohibited imports.
We recall that, at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from entering Russia through counter-sanctions.
The document posted on the official legal information portal stated that the rules had been extended for another year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Originally, the destruction order applied to products from the US, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Ukraine joined the list as of 1 January 2016.
Putin's decree on the destruction of illegal “sanctions” (the food embargo products that Moscow imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.
The Government, for its part, allowed the destruction of “sanctionary” food by any legal means.
As the Western sanctions continued, the Russian Federation also extended its response.
This measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not concern the importation of goods for personal consumption of up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council of the President of the Russian Federation for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, had previously referred to the “simplely immoral” destruction of food, which he said had a negative impact on the upbringing of people.

This is reported by TASS with reference to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
This week, according to ESO, the construction of a dome for the E-ELT telescope (European Extreme Large Telescope) has officially begun, so far the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.
Its total cost is estimated by ESO to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the construction of equipment and the building of the observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, which will be about 39 meters in diameter.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
It's a huge mirror, and two auxiliary surface reflectors with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 m will help E-ELT get the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and search for Earth's doppelgangers.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Although construction of the dome has just begun, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers and other specialists for three years since the first E-ELT construction plans were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, the total value of which was about 400 million euros, was awarded by the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
