Parliament does not support the Timoshenko Freedom Amendment
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in the course of amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to repeal an article which condemned the leader of the opposition, Julia Timoshenko.
The amendment, which would result in the release of the former Prime Minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unprofitable.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timoschenko in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is the political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
Ratification would require 226 votes.
Libya’s Victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya already has losers.
Muammar Qaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert, and the war is over without him.
It's time to identify the winners.
Islamists tend to win the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the regular Sharia Act, of which we have heard.
Libya will become a country free of crime, because the punishment for theft is to cut off the hand.
Women may forget emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we would hardly wish for.
In any event, our way of life is neither unique nor better, and is likely not suitable for, for example, the Libyan population.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from unbelievers.
Their only excuse is that, in their view, NATO's raids were not led by an American general, but by God, whose majesty they glorified after every blow.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians were rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of profit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about the expulsion of the “crusaders”.
Although, without occupation, would the oil companies get the black gold of Libya for almost nothing?
Probably not, and then the West will finally be able to brag about the selfless protection of civil rights.
Unless Shariath's followers put an end to it.
There's a new wave of crisis.
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of investor attention.
A statistical storm passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries released GDP data in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, with Germany and France showing growth.
Yet the debt market today is breaking record.
Investors are already looking not only towards Italy; they now focus on Spain, France, Austria, and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany ' s GDP grew by the expected 0.5 per cent; France increased by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the initial information implied stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was stagnant, which, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, confirmed the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the eurozone and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent over the previous quarter, which is consistent with analysts’ forecasts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2 per cent.
Its 10-year bond yields 28,45%.
The revenue of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the yields of Czech 1-year bonds remain at around 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is said to be the last lender to save the situation.
The Czechs have been selected by EURO.
In Montenegro, they win with a 1:0 score and celebrate an unexpected $200 million prize.
The national team has successfully managed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and the beautiful goal of Peter Jiracek, they won at 1:0.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky to retain a significant advantage after a home-grown return match, and it will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and prepared a detailed report.
It's almost nothing in the first half, and it's a lot of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Jirachek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanovic and Vucinić were the most unfortunate couple of matches after two great opportunities were missed.
The great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football will earn about 200 million Czech kroner.
From the first minute on, the game was very intense.
Both teams had difficulty in performing the combinations; the game was played in the middle of the field for most of the time.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the team of masters in the first half, and the long-range attacks over the defence line were carefully intercepted by Czech defence counsels.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students built a human shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In so doing, they wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, student prayers were followed by prayers for both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students built a human shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They have thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its most recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that everything showed that Iran had not abandoned the attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, student prayers in front of the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant were followed by prayers for both the United States and Israel’s death.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysis of the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, the installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is taking place.
Nutrition of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast or sausage for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 were overweight; while 9 per cent of pupils were overweight, 5 per cent were obese.
According to a recent study, children suffering from obesity usually come from unhealthy families.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and the behaviours accompanying the human being for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on tables of children suffering from obesity almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children suffering from obesity ate fries for dinner on the eve of an educational event called Obesity is not an accident.
Moreover, the families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports; however, this is true of the majority of families of modern school children - only 15 per cent of the children said that their parents took time to engage in sports at least once a week.
The study was carried out among 900 children.
The study was carried out at the end of the last school year; nearly 900 primary students throughout Bohemia participated in it.
Obesity was not an accident for the second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company Všeobecná zdravotní pojišovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students in grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Good nutrition and sufficient sporting burden are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either overweight or obesity.
"For example, only half of the respondents said that they eat five meals a day, a lunch lunch lunch luncheon, and that's one of the essential conditions for proper diet," says one of the findings of the study.
No lunch and no sausage at night.
Experts warn that even relative details, such as permanent family breakfast, are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school families eat breakfast together.
Most families have separate breakfasts.
The worst discovery is that in every tenth family, people don't eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the right day's diet.
The study found that fried food is more commonly used in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet, cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure is reduced by more than half, to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to draw up their own menus based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The preference for food for Czech children aged 12-15 is far from the ideal of healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat, and sweet dishes.
“A particular concern is the popularity of sweet, cool drinks”, says the final part of the study.
As the main meal, the pasta defeated the bird with a small margin.
However, children showed little interest in beans, fish, and vegetables.
Seeking a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also showed that children are prepared to change their eating habits provided that they are provided with relevant information.
“Many members of the monitoring group showed a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they completed the study on Obesity - it's not an accident”, says the project's outcome.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet, cool drinks - more children began to prefer them to just water.
In addition, children were more likely to observe birds and fish as the main dish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and baking.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, professional claims.
In my first article on stylist training, I visited the volume of information in introductory classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in this field; advice on the choice of clothing for non-standard figures; and seminar on how this works in real life.
It's bigger.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks we expect.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time, with Alenka, the director, we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not fully symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other has a boy's figure without proper shape, and another weighs more than normal.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce broad shoulders, extend the neck, or add missing volumes.
We have been given advice on how to highlight the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. women with a bigger breast and thigh and a narrow waist, without wearing them too much.
For example, if the size of the waist and thigh is so large that you can't pick up a skirt or pants, you should have at least one customized thing.
You're not going to regret the investment, because ideally sitting clothes are priceless.
In a custom-made skirt, you'll feel a lot better than the one that keeps moving out, rolls up, strips your waist, and so on.
On the other hand, girls of boys ' figures may wear clothes with rushes, application, embroidery or folding.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I'm glad I've got a whole week to figure this out.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we got.
Each participant had to come up with two outfits for a celebrity: a day and a night.
We have to take into account their modern appearance, their style in their clothes, and the type of shape.
I'm going to wear Miranda Kerr, which you might know on Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself because it's a lot easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who recently recovered a ton (please note that I'm exaggerating), or a very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet, print them out and process them with graphics.
The Mudboard, so called the output, then reflects our own style and attitude to graphics.
It's important to keep the graphics of style in your head.
The stylist not only dresses real people, but creates food pages in magazines (based on specific instructions such as fancy bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Camenick told us about.
But it was only Sunday.
A Stylist Needs Common Knowledge
The Saturday lecture, full of information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests, experts in the field.
Stylist, Honza Pocorna; fashion designer, Yakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Yakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, you can wear your coat-wraps normally, over your jeans and shirts like your coat; but you can also wear it on your naked body, without clapping like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll up your sleeves or lift your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I most appreciated the following advice: "For your work, you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them,' Yakub told us.
Here I finally realized why we're putting together all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, whereas in fashion magazines, we often see something very different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist should have more design options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So for a fashion view on ten pages (equivalent to ten outfits), I have to be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the object of clothing often looks and works in combination with others in a different way than in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pocorna confirmed that often image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing voice, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The treatment of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often think it's unnecessary (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we should expect them to call us a different (lower) size than what they actually wear.
Then we go to Google and see if the tabloids have written anything about some famous fat/death, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that for a stylist, it was not enough to understand fashion and to be able to find a dress.
Our job is basically to communicate with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to measure people, not to condone them and to hold their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can't throw away all of her wardrobe, telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things you can commend, and advise that you can wear with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that he should specifically contain the working bag.
It's a bag you bind around your waist to wear everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky rollers or English pins, it should contain nylon threads (stylists use it to film certain objects, such as bags or hats), special clips to bind tissue on the back in case the clothes are too large (bubbles and similar items are prohibited because they spoil clothes) or a sewing kit.
To get distracted from the lectures and get some practical experience, we've learned to do the right stuff on the soles of the shoes.
Even in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can be damaged, not to mention on the street.
And then we started the sticker.
You don't have to touch your shoes with scissors so you don't spoil them.
It requires real skill.
I was pleased that Mario praised my work.
I didn't like these skills.
That's just part of what we heard in the second part of the weekend course.
I'm beginning to realize that being a professional stylist isn't that easy to say.
V Need for Speed: The run takes place in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a careless walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of totally inappropriate and careless mistakes.
Ambiences had been met to a certain extent, but that was not important, since no one clearly wanted to do any extra work.
Before the release with the new version with the subtitle "Run," there was a lot of hope.
It was expected to move the previous series of "Ned For Speed" into a new direction; demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the genre of the race games.
We were curious to see the parts of the game where the main character got out of the car and ran.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end, much is different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression is eroded by some unnecessary errors that have been present in this series of games for several years.
Which means it's not really a mistake, it's a demonstration of the inexplicable laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You're becoming part of a story whose main hero, Jack, solves some personal problems by taking part in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast in San Francisco, and it's your job to get to New York first.
This idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of 10 stages divided into more than 50 races.
This means that each race takes its own route, and the individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So it doesn't feel like the game is the same all the time.
Although the charts are at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, it is a pleasure to look at some of the tracks.
Still, the game does not give rise to strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, the autumn suburbs, or high in the snowy mountains is a pleasure.
Besides, the race occasionally revives an unusual detail.
In the desert, for example, you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to get caught in a hole.
Individual races are fairly well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while, you're trying to outrun a few rivals (in fact, a normal race); then you're trying to improve time (a standard race with a second meter); or you're competing with one adversary.
Among other things, from time to time, you run into a police force that makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you would expect (three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for a game because it's not boring; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more fun.
The race model follows the tracks of the previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a disadvantage.
If you're looking for a real life simulation, you're going to have to look elsewhere.
Still, this driving model is very good for dynamic racing, although better options can be found in the marketplace.
So far, so good.
However, after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not that good.
You don't expect such a game to be a complex transformation and collision, but if you don't have any idea how your machine will behave, something's wrong.
Normally, bypassing or passing cars in a dense flow, you sometimes touch another car slightly, but sometimes, in a virtually similar situation, your car becomes rabidly twisted.
Or she's broken.
It's not that important because of the restart system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
Restarts are designed so that if you break down or go far off the track, the game returns you to the point where it stopped.
However, only five relaunchs are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work out, but you can't rely on it completely.
Sometimes restarting is not enough, and you have to memorize a separate section of the race.
An important disadvantage of play is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some corners have to go in a certain way, otherwise you just don't fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a certain location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
This is particularly frustrating in situations where you see your opponent passing easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you are there, the machines are already positioned in such a way that you need to either travel around them or slow down.
It doesn't matter when you're around them; it's always the way things happen in front of you.
The opponents have other advantages.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of time, the same rival overtakes you in the same place.
It's especially obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you're driving in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you no matter what.
The thing is, when he's driving in front of you, he's making your view worse, resulting in one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand an attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get annoying fast.
It's a shame, because despite the simple model of driving, the game is interesting and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what makes you bored -- a concept with fifty unique tracks, a race sequence or something.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the gas stations along the way, because that's where your car can switch, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports machines are suitable for cities; powerful American cars for direct highway sections; and exotic super-sport vehicles for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain tracks.
The main mode is closely linked to the challenge mode; it is a race on individual plots that you will learn during the game.
Here you win for your personal business, both medals and glasses common to challenges and story regimes.
Many possibilities are available for higher driving levels, ranging from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is related to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with those of other players, and provides communication to the public.
Here's another weakness that's hard to understand; it's an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (let's think so) where you run down the rails in the dark (let's think so).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's say so) when a subway train suddenly hits you from behind, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For a few days, our editorial debated whether at the time of the game's creation, no one really thought for a second, or whether its creators really think we're such idiots.
The technical element of the game is not very special; but the overall impression from the video series is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although it is unfortunate that in some critical moments, the quality of recording is sometimes reduced quite strongly.
This is especially true of a large number of participants, where good recordings would not be very helpful to you, too.
Sound's fine; soundtrack's on the amateur.
In order to please as wide a youth audience as possible, the soundtrack's "compositions from different styles"; but it's unlikely that a lot of people will buy a game because of its music.
The general impression of Need for Speed is that the escape is rather messy.
If the game were to avoid obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a feeling of incompleteness.
Of course, it's a good fun, but prepare yourself to be blinded as a spotlight at the airport.

Ambassador to the EU, Wizenova:
The Czechs have the reputation of dissenting and skeptics towards the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable disagreement between individual organizations.”
"I didn't expect such a violent war."
"It takes five or six years before the situation stabilizes in any way, calms down and all players get used to their new roles," Ambassador Milena Vicenova of the EU has taken a tough lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She has demonstrated the extent to which she adheres to her motto “Embark and Open About Europe” in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and relations between them so easily and clearly that many lecturers from the Law School of the KU would be envious.
Moreover, Wizenova commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"At first, critics said that he was just a gray office mouse that could not play any role; I must say, everyone was amazed at how well he did his role."
"He is a man who can listen at the same time to the twenty-seven participating countries, who is well-connected with them, and who has a clear idea of which direction the EU should be developing."
She explained her new post as a representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union, which number do I need to call?"; that is, as an important step towards unifying and more transparent Union policies towards countries like China or India.
No one's gonna ban our cheeses.
Vizenova went on to focus on a programme key to the EU in the past, the present and the near future.
She referred to the successful Czech presidency the previous year.
The Czechs have been dealing with an impending financial crisis; they have overcome the crisis and organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Czech representatives in the EU are currently very busy.
As the Ambassador has said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have provoked the ongoing ferocation.
In addition, the new seven-year EU budget needs to be adopted, which is very difficult in view of the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and economical, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and which countries would receive less; all those issues were in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: “On Europe, the Intelligent Language”.
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon, which no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people don't try to sell crooked or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone's going to ban our cheeses?'
It also intends to make better use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs are regarded as Euro-sceptic; as well as people who point out the negative rather than the positive side of things.
She wants more Czech representatives involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors have been responsible: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; and for a little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful Czech presidency, it noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what's the meeting about, the Visegrad group again?" and he's not a bit happy about it.
In the future, the Union of Vicenov is largely awaiting new strict rules for the budgetary policies of the States Parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone."
"We have a Schengen zone, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that the countries that want to unite, while those that don't want to stay away."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe," awaits Vicenov.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all participating countries, not just those of the eurozone.
Mark history:
IBM's innovator is entering the second century of his existence.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one is likely to be "long-lived."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded over a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was laid down by its first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could easily be solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a stamp around which the life of the future giant (and the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935) began to unfold.
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained faithful to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around itself.
In our first hundred years, this has enabled us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more,” says Samuel J. Palmizano, the current head of the company, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of care for employees as Batya in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, insurance from the employer, elegant uniforms, and a sophisticated bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship between IBM and consumers is equally advanced.
From the beginning, the company found brilliant use for talented people, which was one of the first global companies to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Concurs with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan under which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked for IBM for 30 years; she is currently the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, which have generated many future innovations.
No wonder there's a lot of ideas - about half a million people working in the company.
A well-reputed organization
The firm's strong position in the business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning, from the point of view of the IBM concept, she was more of an organization than a technology company," said the Economist, Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business problems using technology," adds George Coloni from the Forrester Research consulting company.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
Over a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as they call it in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies.
It seems to be the most universal technology company -- hardware and software development; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services -- from servers to nanotechnologies.
She owns the largest number of patents in all US technology companies, and five of her employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a bar code and a diskette.
With $220 billion in market capitalization data, IBM became the second largest technology company this year (the first of Apple's companies) to outrun Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look Forward
Not all of its products tasted like buyers and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online; and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is driven by forward movement, you cannot be emotionally tied to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundations on several platforms - if they don't work, it's giving them up.
This differs from, for example, its Microsoft competitor, who is based on and is experiencing a fall on Windows, his operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM's main revenue comes from services, and about one fifth in each case comes from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990, with half the capital, it was the strongest manufacturing company in the world.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth $15 billion, while at the same time investing 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the Great Depression.
Until IBM seems to have damaged the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has risen by record 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have steadily increased.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis erupts, this flexible giant will deal with the situation.
IBM history, from cheese knife to space flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, and its original name, "Creation, Tabulation, Recording Corporation" was quite complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924, which was originally the brand used for Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was based on a merger of four companies, the history of which began in the 1880s.
They possessed technology, such as legendary watches, i.e. watches fixing the time when employees come and leave their jobs.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, a businessman who also headed the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the director of the competition company, to help him run the company.
The leader then moved the founder of IBM into the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the foundation of a firm culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from the name, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, ranging from cheese knives and meat cuts to cash machines.
In the first four years of Watson’s leadership, the revenue doubled to $9 million, and the company began to expand to all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost 40 years later, his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his place in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began developing artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space missions to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969, human flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM line System 360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to a Chinese company, Lenovo, while buying PricewaterhouseCoopers' consulting office, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high value added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its concept of Smarter Planet.
Its objective is to make sound use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned and to improve the road and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, the first country to be located simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
Central and eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague, where there is also a world-level study team dedicated to speech recognition.
Richtarjova about his unfaithful husband:
Yveta, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzhova (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richter (53), became the bodyguard and lover of Yveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa may come home, but not as my partner," explains Richterzow.
When Darina Richtarzhova provided Bartoshov’s home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Yvette to leave Rizjan after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly confessed that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to accept her husband's affair; and now she finally forgave him.
Richter doesn't care who his wife's sleeping with.
Even if Richter and Bartoshov ever break up, his wife won't accept him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one's gonna kick him out."
"But he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as the man with whom I have something to do with," said Richtarzhova, adding that she has already been freed from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm gonna be with Yveta, I'm not gonna change it."
"My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our alliance is still operational; I am responsible for repair, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly normally, but we don't share the bed anymore," said Richter to Blask magazine.
He claims that if he finds a new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she's with, and if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I'm fully responsible," concluded Joseph.
The worst women's habits: Are they touching you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad women's habits, they usually list them all immediately.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, describing a few women's habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your other half complains that you're always shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping on big sales?
If so, your shopping is a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their shopping passion somehow.
Still, which one of you would refuse to go shopping for a perfect seated clothing and try it on (preferably in different colors) in the dressing rooms?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but it could be hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told your mate to wait outside...
Eternal Dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I have to lose at least five kilos. Maybe I should start doing gymnastics."
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you're part of a group of women who are obsessive about their appearance.
Not that you need to stop looking after yourself, but many men are literally allergic to persistent complaints by their mates about their appearance.
Strong genders also agree that the more complaints they arise, the more women irritate them.
The Most Important Is Order and Cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Cleaning the glass, cleaning the vacuum, cleaning the floor, cleaning the dust, cleaning the bathroom, at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for coming to a clean cafe in dirty shoes, children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on a window in the living room that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this “diversion”, try to realize that it is not good to go into extremes; and that order and purity should not be the first place in your family.
A harmless desire for purity can threaten your relationship as well as your entire family.
The Will to Command
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"Are you gonna wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet dish towels shall not lie on the floor."
If you comment on your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want it to be perfect.
Maybe if men realized that, women wouldn't have to command them so much...
Gossip
Some women like to gossip, insult, and intrigue others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to talk about who, where, who, how, and why.
From time to time, I think we're all gossiping.
Let's be frank, it seems to be the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise others, and they, especially in the women's working group, pose a great danger to their environment.
The results of Yagra and The Doctor helped Philadelphia win.
During the NHL game on Monday, two successful shows of hockey attacker Jaromir Yagra helped Philly win 5:3 on Caroline's ice, and he again became the most effective Czech player in the game.
In both cases, Claude Giroux used the experience of a thirty-year-old star; he added another show and was declared the best player in the game.
The two performances also belonged to the team with Yaghor Yakubu Doctorek.
After the game, Yagra told the foreign reporters that he was predicting a great evening for Gira.
"I told him before the match he'd score a hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel things like this," the Yagroe explained, after whose actions Gira scored the goal at the first opportunity Flyers gave.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a Czech trail.
Locking Harrikanes Voraschek took over the puck and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
The second before the first break, the home player Patrick Dwyer reduced the gap at the numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second time, the Flyers again took the lead.
Especially Giroux.
After Yagra's performance, he scored the third goal; his strike was later transformed into the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," said the Jagr, commending his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," added the Jagr.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's pension, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications prevented Matt Reid, who increased the gap to two points.
"Proger was doing great in our area."
"He hit the puck, I accelerated, and Reed went to the far edge."
"I was aiming at him and glad it worked," described my impression from the final goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
He left the game in the second period because of an injury to the upper part of his body.
Together with the experienced defender, Canadians lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomasz Pleacan couldn't score in one of their attacks.
More than the lost glasses, the home coach was saddened by the large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest of us were young people."
"No matter what, there's nothing we can do about it, we just have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
"What was our weakness," added P.K. Soubban's defender.
After 30 attacks, the Czech holkiper Onjay Pavelec helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets Goals, which interrupted the five-bit series of defeats, were filled with five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five government tourism agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Because travel to the West was severely restricted, tourist agencies of that time were mostly selling tours to socialist bloc countries.
Thus, during the holidays Czech tourists travelled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972, when we were able to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which led to considerable restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually to socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovakia citizen wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was needed from that country; otherwise, an individual journey was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered to travel to the West, but either they had to wait in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or they had "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Currency permits were necessary for travel to the West, not given to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without currency permission, it was impossible to obtain money (Western currency) for travel to the West.
Most of the time the Czechs spent their vacations at home, resulting in large numbers of cottages and summer homes, a habit that continues to exist today.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989 leave to the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our journeys, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox, which we no longer understand, is that before 1989 we were unable freely to visit Croatia, which is now the most popular, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring countries in Western Europe was lifted, resulting in a huge wave of short trips, mostly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakia couldn't be satisfied with their travels to the West, and everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income at the time was insufficient for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring its own food (conserves, salami, etc.) in order to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, and after decades, our tourists are finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income have increased, leading to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled travel agencies to prepare regular flights by charter airlines, and in comparison with the past, air travel has become incredibly cheap because of the ability to order wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit virtually all the developed worlds except the US, which made our travels even easier.
The next major event in the history of post-revolution travels occurred in 2000, and a large demand has historically led to the first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have transported Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flight from the Czech Republic will take 12 exotic directions.
At present, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our post-revolution development, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US cancelled the need for a visa for Czech tourists, and our country has thus permanently joined the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during their leave abroad, including their spending at their destination.
The General Assembly must choose the President, the threat of the Pat's coming back.
For about five months, Czech football had no president, and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Gašek, head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburka on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on the electoral rules.
Without that, one of the three candidates will not be voted on.
Yindrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are eager to lead Czech football.
He left his post in June and called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong person to lead the football in the future.
However, the era of Gashek once again loaded football in a dispute between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became apparent on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly came to the National House in Prague, Smychov, for nothing, because the talks remained blocked, not just the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the general assembly, only the legal representatives or also the officials to whom the credentials had been granted.
This point has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of the State and Rights that representation based on the powers granted is not possible.
Disputes about electoral rules, however, continue.
Neither did the Executive Council much help, although it is mainly concerned with this issue in its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary.
Submissions of voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do we go to round 3 and avoid a panic?
“The dispute is whether to follow the established standards or find another model”, says one of the vice presidents of FAČR Dushan Liberty, who represents professional football in the association's office.
Based on the model provided for by the statute, the winner of the third round is a candidate who has received great support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree to a compromise - to consider a candidate with the largest number of votes in both chambers to be the winner of the election.
The Czech side insists that, in the overall percentage, the winner must gain at least two thirds of the vote.
"Then, at least, the two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; this would have completely rejected the concept of the two chambers," Freedom agrees with Moravia's argument, and he says that it would be better not to change the rules and vote according to existing rules.
Some sudden, Tomás Paclik agrees with his opinion, although the electoral rules defined by the statute estimate that Pelta is more eligible than other candidates.
"I'd like the elections to be as far as possible by statute."
"I want to avoid all sorts of representational stupidity, as at the previous general meeting," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is for the first time a candidate; and in his remarks he largely contradicted Pelte.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He trusted that the new President would be known in Nimburca; he also hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"Emotional fermentation will rest after today's expected release of the national team to the European Championships."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate," says the representative of Appleonez, who, of the three candidates, has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Reichle's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"This is not between Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"It could cause another breakdown in the general meeting."
"I hope common sense wins," said Reichle.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, separate talks took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was to be carried, among others, by the Vice-Presidents of Dabir Kuchera and Raichl to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning because of a technical malfunction, seeking an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the replay site.
After all, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is expected on Wednesday, can be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Joseph Dobesh, would like to see the parties to the strongest sports association in the country come to an agreement.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; football creditworthiness; and a planned ČSTV general meeting with a new Czech Sports Directorship after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik is entering the presidential struggle because he doesn't see the right candidate.
If, prior to the extraordinary general meeting, Plzen's head of footballers, Tomás Paclik would have seen a strong candidate who would have met all his requirements for the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have even claimed a high position.
"If there was a decent candidate, I'd fight for him and I wouldn't fight for him myself."
"But no such person has yet been found," said Paclik ČTK.
Paclik's motive to fight against Miroslav Pelta and Yindrich Reich is to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged favor of the election, from joining the FAČR administration.
Moreover, Paclik emphasizes that if he wins, he will only remain president until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be occupied by an experienced top manager, not too connected with football life.
"I've spoken to a few people who could be kept in mind."
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they didn't even want to have anything to do with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that view," he said.
At present, the main disagreement between Paclik and Pelta is related to the latter's relationship with Roman Berbrom, president of the Plzen Regional Football Association, Berbr, a man of conflicting reputation, who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist who can influence the voices of the general assembly delegates.
Paclik thus considers it unacceptable that Pelta be president.
"If he wins, the current situation will not change, and football will not move forward."
"With the support of Burb, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful to football," said Paclik.
He hints at the fact that Pelta's name was recorded a few years ago during the phone tapping in the corruption investigation; Pelte managed to escape the sentence.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, and now he's not mentioning his old saying that he'll "sell the Plzen Club if Pelta becomes president."
If Paclik wins Thursday, he could have imagined cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reich, whom Paclik supported before the general assembly in September, which ended with a fiasco.
"He would be the first person I'd turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce him to the team."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't have a nose in things I don't know either," said Paclik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judicial brigade led by Ludek Mazella, replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims he'll risk running an association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer, he has managed the Plzen team, which, with his help, celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to make the football environment change, to support it for the better."
“To limit the influence of certain groups of individuals who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, which leads to heinous situations”, said Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to Director Sparta Daniel Krjetsky.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will lobby at the highest political level for more money for sports from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points the new president must address."
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go,” he said.
Paclik does not consider his connection to the Plzen Club to be a burden, although he claims that President FAČR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to the Applenut, and Reichle's to the Prague Dookla.
"That's not the perfect option."
"And yet I see no point in the hypocritical handing over of my shares to the Plzen Club to someone else if I'm going back in six months," says Paclik.
Pelta promised new FA ChR rules to avoid Chosen Pat.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for the new FAČR rules in order to avoid disputes over election rules in the future.
Before negotiations on Thursday in Nimburke, the functionary of the Applenace remains optimistic and believes that attention from the election struggle will be a tangible distraction to the expected success of our football team today.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general assembly, and a two-month delay could thus be useful to him to resist his idea of football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the President to be known on Thursday."
"They feel it's time for someone to lead an association," claims a man who is mostly associated with the Yablonec Club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the Association's executive committee.
This gives him reason to believe that he's experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Gašek.
"Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at a general meeting in June."
"If different means of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September," said Pelta.
He viewed the correspondence of the key document of the civil association as a false goal for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I'm going to take on my personal responsibility if this attempt proves to be a failure."
"It's a fundamental question without which we can't exist," says Pelta.
In addition, he says he's not trying to single out himself against the background of his rivals.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Yindrich Reich, whom he valued for legal education; he was well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should be his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Paclik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been in football for over a year and has made some success."
"Either way, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by his campaigning methods."
"And that's why some of them now question his true identity," said Pelta about his competitor, and Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He thinks he's a major weapon of football knowledge, from the lowest-level competition to the national team.
The national team is supposed to represent the entire football team.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the case of the Bohemians or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"After that, I would focus on negotiating with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football," a 40-year-old candidate said ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the position of football head would not entail the dismissal of staff.
"I'm going to need to know the employee's instructions." That was his message to Insurance, where a prolonged period of power causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general meeting, he trusted that delegates would arrive in Nimburk on Thursday for good.
"If the only question is how to hold elections in the third round, we can handle it."
“Futball needs the trust that he can only gain by finally electing his leader,” says Pelta, who, two days before the key day of his career as a functionary, remains optimistic.
Reichle promises that under his leadership, FAČR will become active.
If, at a meeting on Thursday, Yindrich Reich, the current vice president, becomes president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association are said to be dissatisfied.
Raichl promises that if he's elected, it's time for hard work.
He wants to introduce changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for selected areas in football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the Bohemians; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money into football; and to continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Gaszek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, professional football and football events for young people."
"That's not what I'm gonna say, I'm gonna do it myself," he said in his interview with ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to distribute the powers of the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area."
"I will carefully assign tasks so that, in each of these segments, football will take great steps forward."
"It's probably not going to please a lot of people, because it's going to mean hard work, not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly led him to question his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every move," he explained his doubts.
"At the same time, a lot of people told me I shouldn't give up, or other people will come."
"It's trust that I can't give up," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gaschek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to cross it all."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, were elected, the situation in the Association might return to the one before Gaszek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and this is something that is unlikely to be qualified by Mirek Pelta."
"He's surrounded by people who would play football so that it's accessible only to the chosen ones."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but I'm definitely not subjective."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority," said Reich.
Moreover, he refutes the accusations that he will be only the President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about splitting the second league into the Czech and Moravian sections, the winners of which would continue to fight in the first league."
"It will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Reich.
While Plzen's manager Tomás Paclik has joined the presidential struggle, Rychl has not dared to assess his chances of winning.
“However, I still have strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its vice president, and I see that I have made some obvious progress,” said Raichl, and to his success, he attributed the savings of tens of millions of crowns on unprofitable contracts, the negotiation of contracts with television and the negotiation of a lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was “excluded from the process of returning credit to Czech football”, he considers another rival, Paclik, to be a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzen this year."
"If he is chosen, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started, without significant changes in the staff of the committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his own benefit," said Reichle about his rival.
Europe’s Most Beautiful Pools
Jump in the water
Julia Stanek
Universal fibre-optic children's pools and status pools in Budapest, travelers can test the incredible water of Europe and relax the tired body in the tub after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder could not afford to go on his research trips for the last year and a half: without his bathing suit.
While she was lying on her back in the water, she looked up to the taste of the well-formed domes, swam to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired carefully rebuilt swimming pools in the ar-nuo style.
She was in a hurry to add every nice pool to her notebook, with important details about the building and the history of the building.
The architect of the architecture Meder examined more than 200 swimming pools -- and now she gathered impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden, where everything went, from public swimming pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and “functional concrete buildings” in Townus.
Its “travel into the most unusual bathing suits in Central Europe” took place through 13 countries, in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited bathing suits in Italy, the Czech Republic, France, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old author, a real fan of bathing culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but it's different in the water.
The only disadvantage is that swim fans must accept the blue cafeteria tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe with the lucrative smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyous whistling of birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible," says a woman living in Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Pooling and exquisite oils in sauna is a health factor in bathing, because Meder believes that all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on this kind of work. "Instead of the pool floor, you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles, and trams.
The 190-page Illustrated Bathing Pleasure contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of oasis of health - and makes you want to jump into the water.
Meder's water collector found several outstanding copies during a study in Hungary.
She found nitrita-rich water in a carst cave (a cave bath in Mischltz Tapolc) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottled building (Városi Termálfordö in Yasberen), as well as excellent therapeutic baths, such as the 100-year-old Secheni baths in Budapest.
Of the many warmed open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, you can see the whole Zurich from the bathing room on the roof, or you can see the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anton, and there's a window in the steam room to see what's happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld, and the Aqua Cathedral in Eztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, it rises a pair of three open shells, which seem very small in the background of the Ezthal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Meder's pool collector didn't smell chlorine in every pool.
A lot of thermal baths smell like gray.
The smell causes hydrocarbonates in alkaline water, and the water is almost black from the sludge that sticks to the skin as you sink into the pool, a healthy experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at a certain point in her search for beautiful bathing places, and when she tried to visit the open basin of the Czech baths in Lugačovica, she discovered that the area was sealed.
The baths, designed by architect Dushan Jurkovich in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked in the view of the windows of the red-and-white-yellow Ar-nuo-style building, she saw weeds growing between the cafeteria tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by hot trails, an amazing swimming pool in Schwartzwald, the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction, and you will discover not only the neo-Roman elements of the period after construction in 1844, but also the Mauritanian Alhambra Hall, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace, the favorite swimming pool of the Iris Meder pools, and not just because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"This is a real achievement -- so skillful to combine these different architectural styles," says Meder.
Dumping in a thermal pool in a palace like this is obviously a minor occupation.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank investigates agricultural trade.
Christian Tives
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann commissioned the working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the world’s poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
For German citizens, the situation is clear: According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems faced by the poorest people around the world.
The findings were drawn from a study carried out by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Garald Schuman, shows that the stakes on world commodity exchanges raise prices – and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is directed directly against the head of Deutsche Bank, Joseph Ackermann, although large banking houses, such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, are also traded in the same way.
Originally, commodity rates were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that the players have abandoned supply and demand rules – and are being profited at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike United States competitors, Ackermann responded to criticism, promised to investigate the charges and stated that no trade “is worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at risk”.
In accordance with SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decline or cease altogether.
Ackermann's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude to the financial sector. “The price of food is an egregious example of how banks now act recklessly against common interests.”
As the main lobbyist of the bank, Ackermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
“Deutsche Bank must remove from the portfolio all investments that make money on food prices,” said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if it's about hungry people or Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Acckermann's quick reaction is surprising at first, but the director would like to have a perfect image just a few months before he ended up in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not go to the supervisory board as planned.
The elimination of controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
It also has little to worry about the costs - the consequences will have to be borne by its successor.
One in two would not invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, which was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
No more than 11 per cent believe that the investments that charge the price of food are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many bank customers would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such trade, and according to the study, one in two would withdraw deposits that eventually lead to speculation.
43 per cent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 per cent said that they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st century House in Vienna
A Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Winsowski
==History==The architectural history of the rises, fallbacks and happy endings: The Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and abandoned.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a famous example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, which have expressed their confidence in technological progress.
The Svantser Pavilion won the Grand Prix in architecture in 1958 for its light floating structure of steel and glass.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built an Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
After all, he was famous for the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and her sister for a bowl-shaped building.
The Pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near the Southern Station of Vienna, transformed and opened as the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - and is often referred to as the 20th century House for that reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - there were no walls to hang artworks and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and his condition has become worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has now renovated a pavilion called the 21st century House and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is a branch of the Bellvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibit on Tuesday night, a happy event in every sense.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Bellveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a figurer in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and eventually became founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, persuaded politicians and custodians to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was supposed to contain a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Wotruba Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore, along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict Control & Limited Budget
Krishanitz was then the perfect candidate for the project.
He was famous, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession, Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied from Schwanzer at the University of Vienna in technology, and the pavilion was a "exclusively important place" where he attended the "almost weekly" exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the challenges that were facing the building, a building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems encountered during the last restructuring were much more serious, and the building was an energy absorber, says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, the glass reinforced glass safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-powered safety glass.
The steel walls of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created space for new use of the building, and the falling light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a virtually new building, but still the elegant Schwanzer pavilion.
The original outer doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red-brown colour of protection against corrosion.
The cinema hall is the same as it used to be.
It's all under strict control of museum management and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and would have been approved by the museum administration," says Krishanitz, pointing to an uneven floor in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite constraints, problems and transformation.
Krishanitz recently noticed that the Brussels pavilion was rude - a typical story of "copley in the city."
Such an architecture is “always out of place” and still wants to “stimulate real awareness”.
The 21st century house is in the right place, because the city's planning has been an unexpected success, and the fully rebuilt main station quarter, with offices and housing, is growing around the Swiss Garden.
The 21st century house may be supplemented by the second building of Krishanitz, collector Francesca von Habsburg, who has acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city about its location next to the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multi-million-dollar winter crisis package
Deutsche Bahn released a crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in the winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid the winter cancellations and delays of trains.
Referring to the Deutsche Bahn internal crisis plan, the newspaper Bild reports that investments totalling about 300 million euros are planned until 2015.
Investments are designed to improve the performance of locomotives and the railway network even under extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and engaged staff involved in cleaning snow from tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before work and 90 per cent of the required arrows within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancelling and late trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport because she lacked reserves at a time when weather conditions were deteriorating.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays in ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE train axis much more frequently for many years after one of the ICE trains broke the axis at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay a lot of millions of pounds of fine in the United States.
New troubles followed the upheavals around Joseph Ackermann, Director General of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a fine in the United States of America of £million.
As if Deutsche Bank had little trouble in his home country, the past industrial giant in the United States had caught him up, and Deutsche Bank, with its headquarters in Frankfurt, would pay $145 million (106 million euros) to calm disputes arising from the bankruptcy of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The bond price fell sharply during the financial crisis and pulled down credit unions.
"We're glad to have solved this problem without the parties going to court," said Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank did not plead guilty in the agreement.
The same is true for Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA president Debbie Matz welcomed the rapid reaction of both banks.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
The NCUA struggles to compensate for the losses from billions.
It's the first of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and filed a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Dubious mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a mortgage pool.
They're backed up by domestic loans.
This determined the fate of a number of financial companies when the real estate bubble in the United States burst in 2007.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life on the brink of the financial crisis in September 2008.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still struggling with the storm.
Investors and regulators filed a large number of claims seeking compensation or punishment of fraudsters.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It blames the 18 largest international banks for having purchased some $200 billion in bond agreements from American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank is also at risk of being prosecuted by FHFA for numerous agreements with a total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a bank with a headquarters in Frankfurt to assume responsibility for “substantial losses”, but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank dismissed the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM.
Buffet's financial guru is actively investing in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the largest American investor, Warren Buffet, has always claimed that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed his view of investing in the industry.
According to Buffet, he should have known much earlier that IBM first offers services and buys computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investments were considered a knight's act.
IBM, an IT-industry veteran, has now won the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the United States business channel CNBC, Buffet reported that since March he had purchased IBM shares totalling $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM shareholders with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffet said that even IBM until recently knew nothing about his involvement.
He commended management, which had managed to make profits even during the financial crisis.
"They did a great job," said Buffet, referring to management strategy.
For a long time, IBM focused on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, also offers software and advice, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffet has been avoiding technology companies.
He claimed he only invests in companies that he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, the production of lubricants and engineering.
His holding of Berkshire Hathaway holds shares in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Munchener Ruck), along with some 80 of his own subsidiaries.
An 81-year-old bought a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built one of the world's most expensive companies with a skilled investment.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
Making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable money-making instinct brought him the nickname "Oracula of Omaha."
IBM stock prices rose by one percent before opening markets after Buffet's investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is also called, stands on the stock exchange for more than $220 billion, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
The imminent danger
After the identification of the Tswickau cells, the Turkish media began to question the authority of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers is talking about a blood ideology that's coming up again.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a response in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long-forgotten fears, such as right-wing extremist attacks on the Turks have not occurred since the fires in Mellin in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
It has never been doubtful, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has now been discovered is of a magnitude that is not yet fully understood.
"Resurrection of Bloody Ideology?" was the headline of the Internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant for the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be dragged into the right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, remembering the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral labour contract at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light as a success story.
Coverage in some Turkish media was like a slap. "German's 50th anniversary gift" is the name of an article on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriet, too, did not miss the opportunity to draw this parallel.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulahji.
He notes that people were killed who paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany by their work.
Police conduct and subsequent successful raids were strongly criticized on German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought before of following suspicious persons in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have reached a rather sharp rhetoric. “If they continue to act as clumsy, migrants will have no choice but armed self-defence.”
"It'll be the best self-defense."
"The world in Germany is very much dependent on how the whole network is opened and the legality of punishment," writes Selen.
The crimes in Mellin and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to peace in Germany.
The photo of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply captured in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks living here so clearly that they are in danger, and the Germans that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do not repeat past mistakes
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the failure of the German police following the attacks, and Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mellin.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the arson in Zolingen, but his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel took part in the memorial ceremony in Cologne in his speech to calculate the taxes that Turks pay in Germany,
It's like he defined the value of a person by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has shown again how many German Turks have since become more distrustful of the current German state.
By clearly demonstrating what needs to be done now, in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal on Lake Zurich
Most of Europe’s high-risk banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost collapsed during the financial crisis and has been constantly fighting one or the other crisis ever since.
Now the German must return him to the right course.
Alex Webber probably didn't know he'd get that part.
In July, after his impressive resignation as head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that he would take up an equally effective position in 2013 as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was clearly thrilled, praised Switzerland for its beauty, the UBS for its newfound strength, and made a few friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS managed to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel."
But it became clear in September that things would be different.
The UBS trader in London beat the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The UBS Executive Director, Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Webber finally take over?
Webber has been required to consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he'll be chairing the board in May, not in 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Webber.
He's an economics professor and a Central Bank specialist, not a traditional banker, and he's definitely gonna need time to adapt.
He was suddenly responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved once again that he had long earned the rank of the “greatest bank scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, is very big -- until recently, it managed the world's largest assets -- and, on the other hand, it hasn't been out of scandals for years.
A proud Swiss bank seems to spare nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a beautiful reputation.
The bank combined the image of a hidden and stable but sloppy asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become the largest player in an investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus having more money in the management of wealthy clients than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, he joined the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and a longtime professor at the University of Zurich Institute of Banking, explains, "I've always given my students UBS as a model of a good bank."
"Knowing what we know now, you can ask me how I could be so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was going wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and, to the same extent, a brilliant banker, suddenly resigned from his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The bank's investment unit tried to play on sub-standard securities and had to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The Bank was indeed able to find investors – but investors whose services many bankers would have recently politely refused – one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so hidden that its name was not even announced.
It was just the first punch.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses, and the President of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospelle, the second-largest chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, there was a catastrophe, and because of the lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS faced the threat of collapse, and the government had to save it.
The National Bank purchased toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a mandatory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked: the country realized the dramatic consequences of having huge banks in a small country.
After all, the total balance of UBS in 2007 was five times as high as the total production of Switzerland (see graph).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says banking analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first one.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that it was willing to pass data on to wealthy clients who might have been taxed by the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of compensation for unjustified business income plus fines.
UBS thus more or less recognized that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been his advantage in the fight for rich clients, a veil of secrecy.
After this scandal, Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The customer's money has begun to run out.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both of its main areas of activity - investment through poor speculation and asset management as a result of aid and tax evasion.
And it just calmed down, and it seemed like UBS had managed to reverse the situation, as this accident happened with the treacher, and one single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
“The Adoboli incident clearly showed that risk control has not changed enough”, says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: "The problem with UBS is that he doesn't have a risk control tool."
It is caution that has long made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world’s largest assets, not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether or not the world has collapsed outside the Alpine Republic.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unbreakable reliability, as Lindt and Springli symbolize a sophisticated taste in chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still corresponded to the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, but it was a little larger.
It's a classic of itself.
The head office of the bank is located in Zurich on Bangofstrasse, which leads from the main station to the Zurich Lake, surrounded by snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings are luxurious, and rental rates for stores are among the highest in Europe.
Among traditional Swiss stores like Confiserie Springli, you can find jewelry companies like Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been based here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Creedy Suisse Palace and elite private banks, such as Julius Bare.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls there are large leather couches next to the bank's label, a large sign of Safe.
UBS knows what his clients need, reliability.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned the Swiss concepts of banking – or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper -- like all Swiss bankers, he's also cooperating with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large - particularly in an investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his view, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there is something, then they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it the first big profits – and then failed – that no other financial institution in Europe lost as much money in the jungle of sub-standard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the country's history," wrote Lucas Hassig in his book The UBS Crack.
Politicians have approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to that?
If you ask Swiss banks, they'll say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
The two banks that formed UBS added to each other. One was a rich but powered bank specializing in the management of assets in Zurich; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin an almighty wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Wolfley, executive director of the UBS group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Osple, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Osple were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wolfley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and profoundly understanding models and statistics, and Osple with his inner instinct, all the way up, starting with an intern at the bank."
But Osple eventually put his trust in Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember very well the meetings of board members at which Wolfley always repeated the same slogan: to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was leading the "Tourning Table" where banks were making progress.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make a part of that journey.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weakness, and in terms of what is termed “permanent income”, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS has failed in American mortgage products.
In order to shut the hole, the UBS engaged in an adventure that almost cost him his life.
In pursuit of growth, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in American sub-standard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that combined securities based on American mortgages and sold them further - continuing to bear the risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought until the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire," says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to clean up the bank proved more difficult than originally seemed.
The posts in UBS have become a children's game with chairs and remain unreliable until today.
Anyone who leads this huge bank is facing an almost impossible task.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Bank analyst Geiger already has the idea of abandoning investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not yet ready to go this far.
Nevertheless, it is clear that investment activities need to be significantly curtailed.
The new head of the Bank, Sergio Hermotti, is planning to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was in fact viewed only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
Since then, he has been able to demonstrate character and, as the Zurich Bank stated on Tuesday, he now leads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions must be Axl Weber's.
Publicly, he still says he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe is drawn down by the American Stock Exchange
The impending recession in Europe has eroded the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has overwhelmed hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the bud.
The overall relief that followed the change of governments in Rome and Athens was not backed up.
The euro fell relative to the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full, not half empty -- but now the problems are back to the top, said Mark Lucini of Janey Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, among other things, were on sales lists.
The Dow Jones index closed at 12.078 with a drop of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer fluctuated between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The larger S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, dropping by one percent.
Nasdaq's technology index lost 0.8 per cent, trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 per cent, closing at 5,985 points.
Industry in 17 euro-zone countries has significantly reduced production and is adapting to the end of growth.
Eurostat Statistics reported that companies produced two per cent less in September than in the previous month.
"We're not on an island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe was unlikely to quickly shake the recession and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these concerns, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything it needed to end the crisis.
He therefore felt that it was too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffet threw a decade-old principle into the trash basket and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His IBM investment of more than ten billion dollars raised the stock price of this oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The stock closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.
Buffet stated that he paid an average of $170 for the stock and now has a share of 5.5 per cent.
The price of his investment company, Berkshire Hathway, fell by 1.3 per cent.
Bank of America stock fell by 2.6 per cent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted almost all of its remaining portion of the Chinese Building Bank into cash, providing $6.6 billion.
The Bank mainly plans to maintain its capital quota with net sales gains to meet stricter standards.
Boeing's aircraft manufacturer won by reducing the losses on Dow-Jones.
The stock price rose by 1.5 per cent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-range 777-series aircraft worth $18 billion.

Some 710 million shares have changed ownership of the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock of 719 companies increased, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.

Smart crows fill cities
Now experts say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to be driven out of cities.
Some people like birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and crows have been part of the city's landscape for centuries, but people complaining about dirt and noise are getting bigger in many localities.
The problem of birds, however, is far from being solved.
At the first symposium on crows in Lear, East Frisia, experts argued that it was no longer possible to expel graches from cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Finding Urban Alternatives
Conservativeists argued that the root of the urban problem was the migration of specially protected graches, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction and cutting of traditional nesting trees have made life more difficult for birds.
The crows are under guard.
There are large colonies in the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west in Yever, Dipholc, Ahim under Bremen and Lera, with more than 600 parents.
A controversial project to shoot crows in Lera caused disapproval of newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described the catching of birds in traps and the slaughtering of them with sticks as particularly cruel.
"The usual movement and frightening doesn't do anything." said the architect and landscape designer Werner Cleaver of Lera.
Breaking down water or cutting trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"Livables dissipate, and large colonies divide and spread to other areas."
Disruption is only possible on an exceptional basis near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We're going to have to live with them, and getting rid of them is not an option."
In isolation from the surroundings, the urban problem will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Khelner.
The combination of frightening birds from protected residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be an exit.
"The information stands instead of chainsaws" was a slogan proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist Utah Maria Jürgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be confident to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information about the lives of very smart graches.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also gave her opinion on complaints about noise made by birds. "The noise transmits a lot of information, they have a lot to say to each other."
The minds and the cleverness of these birds have come into the legends, and not only do they use weapons to capture the sighted piece, but they also make weapons themselves.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the measure of the avian mind on four grams.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they had to knock on a board to get the moth larvae.
Without much training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the tablet.
In another experiment, smart graches had to solve a more complex task.
Researchers put a small bucket with a moth larvae in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get a prey with a beak.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and hooks to grab a bucket by a pen and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four grams have done it since the first attempt.
Ronaldo is taking Portugal to Euro2012.
The hope of Bosniacs and Turks to win at the last minute was long overdue.
The Favorites of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the last seats in the Euro2012 Championships in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the leadership of the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored for 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina with a score of 6:2 (2:1), perfecting its fifth Euro entry after 0:0 in the first phase.
The Czechs were sufficient to 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of playoffs against Montenegro's outsider after a clear victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss its chance by playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily reached the 1:1 (1:0) account against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Velosa (80th minute) scored the rest for Portugal.
A former professional player in Wolfsburg, Staran Mishimović, and Captain Emyr Spahic, reduced the difference by two points, thanks to the 41st minute effective penalty and the 65th goal behind Bosnia.

Wolfsburg's former player from the English championship, Manchester City, sent the ball with his head to the bottom of the pants for 33 minutes, but the ball did not cross the gate line.
Jirachek scores for the Czech Republic.
Then the focus was Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
Following the attack on Elder Postigu at the Bosnians' Penalty Site at the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was faking, and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also sentenced doubtful penalties for playing the game with his hand after the foul of Fabiu Quantran - Mishimović executed it.
After the break of the European Vice-Champions in 2004, four more scores were added.
Peter Jirachek dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs for the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships are the fifth consecutive European Championship.
The team of Coach Michael Bilek and the Legionaries of the Bundesliga, Michael Kadletz (Bayer Leverkuzen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FK Nürnberg) also smiled after an error at the very beginning, which could have been catastrophic.
The gatekeeper Peter Chech for the 9th minute, thanks to an instant reflex, prevented the potential tomash Siwok's motorway.
Montenegro's best chances were when there was a duet of Stevan Jojetić and Dejan Damjanovic.
Damjanovic hit from the edge of the parking lot for the 40th minute and almost scored a goal for the Chechen.
After a break, the trout saved the already beaten-up Czech world-class holchiper after the FC forward Seoul left the field for the 50th minute.
The winning goal was hit just before the final whistle.
In the meantime, Turkey lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing zero in Istanbul, the Turks couldn't play better than zero in Zagreb.
Although there is little doubt that Gus Hiddink's coach will now vacate on the bench of the team that reached third place in 2002, the Croats are on the fourth European final tour.
The Turks were almost able to launch perfectly in front of the 31,000 viewers at the Maximir Stadium.
Celjuk Inan's long-distance hit the bar for the seventh minute, and Kazim Kazim's attacker failed to beat the ball in the net.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly took control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent shape.
The Legionaries of the Bundesliga, Daniel Pranic (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Ainthrat, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukic of the Wolfsburg team, who gave over to Ivan Perishic of Dortmund for the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is on his way to Euro2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro trip after Germany in 1988.
The team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni -- who already looked confident after winning 4:0 in the first stage -- took the leadership for the 32nd minute thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Constantine Vasiliev of the guest team equals the score for the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the start, but it was only at the 23rd minute that Robbie Keene from Los Angeles hit the first clean bare.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from leading Ireland forward.
The goal was full for 32 minutes.
Bypassing the holkiper Paul Londack's defense, Ward found himself in the right place and, by putting the ball across the line, changed the score by 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double its workforce in China in the next few years.
The Dax listing company announced on Thursday that it was going to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and employ thousands of people," said Bill McDermott, one of the executive directors of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
A total of 2,500 people are expected to grow to 4,500.
The world market leader for industrial software plans to double the number of his offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chendu and Daljan.
This country, which is experiencing an economic boom, has about 4,000 SAP clients out of more than 176,000 worldwide.
China's growth calculation is an important component of the 2015 strategy of this company, which is listed in the Dax.
SAP plans to increase its turnover to Euro20 billion by 2015.
Last year, a company from Waldorf earned about 12.5 billion euros.
The software provider, with 55,000 staff worldwide, looks better than ever.
SAP has been in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to scale up our operations," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to achieve sustained growth based on information in China."
Massacres - the human dimension
Peter Englund's intense and very kind new book "The Beauty and Pilgrimage: The Personal History of the First World War" begins with a long list of actors that kills the heart.
Here's how to read the following: Cut this page carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund speaks, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon at those moments when, like one of these men and women, you get off the road and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as "work on antihistory."
There are few known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are few ambassadors, clever journalists, or discussions about tactics and military equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, it's a book about what it was like, it's about feelings, experiences, feelings, and a state of spirit.
The book "Beauty and Pilgrimage" combined the experience of 20 more or less unfamiliar men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone gets captured, loses his arm or his leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives are flashing here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are extinguished at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
It's also an amendment to the idea that the First World War was only a gravel war on the West Front.
The Beauty and Pilgrimage provides the panoramas of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are hit by bee hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is the tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War covers the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smokeless powder.
When you're not far from hearing the canon, and you're a woman at home with the kids, will you stay here or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on or why we have to fight this war.
"The lack of facts," observes Mr. Englund, "is filled with speculation, speculation, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
Beauty and Pilgrimage traces the fate of people like Florence Pharmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas Navy.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other material already published.
Their stories may be scary or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to Mr. Englund's small moments and fragmentary details.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with it.
When he tells the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzaz, there's an erzac everywhere."
"Coffee replacement, forged aluminium, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He keeps talking about the eszac food in Germany.
He describes “poultry rice boiled in ovine fat (and decorated with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; footwear covered by a tree”.
He notes that there were “837 registered meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausage, 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories speak of honour and courage.
One American sees himself as the most violent, and says about war, "You feel that at the end of the day, this is what men were made for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, an evening paper or a bestseller, and to say that this show is a civilization and that under your shiny shirt there is no barbarian."
On the contrary, a British soldier notices that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
"When a person accepts the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think it would happen in front of the public," he writes.
But it's the other way around, it's like a "convicted man who's been hanged in secret."
Other comments concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new types of fear.
"The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war factory."
He marks the arrival of someone who is called "a new species of the bestiary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-mixed suit that organizes a massacre sitting behind a writing table."
People are acting in an unexpected way: the low-level actions are as much heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke about soldiers who tried to get sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The greatest expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhoeal gnomes that soldiers bought and smeared in their genitals in the hope of reaching the hospital," he writes.
"Every desperate person was wiping it in the eye, which often led to life's blindness."
Translated with the Swedish Peter Graves Proza by Mr. Englund, a flexible but non-brostic, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how the war “released completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are starting to ask why their leaders force them to fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fassel or novels such as "On the West Front Without Change" by Erich-Marie Remark, rather than exhaustive historical writings.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unshaped pantheon.
His book has the most amazing finale that I can remember in non-fictional literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he reached out to a page with a list of characters, took it out of your hands, and set it on fire with a match.
After the previous error, a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers, some wearing protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The night watch from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because there should have been the least people in Zucotti Park at this time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, and the others were first told that they were on their way to the exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the events, and his presence highlighted how much the Department of Police attached to operations.
There could not be a repetition of episodes of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which was contrary to the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to release the Zucotti Park protesters.
The authorities were preparing to observe the expansion of occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on Randall Island with a view to Zucotty.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - with reference to Lower Manhattan.
The last exercise took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute," told a source familiar with orders that referred only to the assignment as "training."
"The few cops I know who were called to this case, they didn't say they were being sent to Zucotti Park," said this man, who spoke anonymously.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zucotti Park were at the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but they retreated to hundreds of protesters who were rushing inside before the deadline, hearing about the plans.
The operation was conducted on Tuesday by members of various police units, including those from the districts, the police teams, which were usually used to control criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like work, come and leave the park during the day, making 1:00 a.m. an appropriate time for an offensive.
"It was right to do it when the park had the least people," he said.
Rescue vehicles with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The spotlights and prerecorded ads coming from loudspeakers seem to have intimidated many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue windshields, many protesters simply packed their bags and left.
The police reported that the tents had not been touched until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters time to pack their bags.
Other teams of police officers, according to eyewitnesses, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case arrests were required in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the police department, said it was for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see the police and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could take pictures.
When the police went west through a pile of personal belongings of protesters, including bags, plastic mats and plastic bags full of clothes, the Department of Health teams followed her, collecting what had been abandoned.
Some protesters who refused to leave were pulled out, and photos of this soon appeared on the Internet.
A major group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen, at the center of the park.
Some of them built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp chained themselves together.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The rescue services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clean-up operation was completed approximately 75 minutes later, and the police reported.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most of them were arrested for “infringing public order and resisting arrest”, he said.
The highest officer in the field was Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, D.C.P.P.D., was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “not led the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to enter.
The fences were placed in Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw the police extend the perimeter from these positions even beyond the Zukotti Park border.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people further away.
About 28 people were on the north perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5:00 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, fired air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The school service union will sue the city for dismissal.
The union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor pupils are enrolled.
The trial is probably the last resort available to the trade union of the District Council 37, trying to cancel the dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, a contact point for parents and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October, as a result of the fact that trade union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to health funds managed by labour groups to fill the gap in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Wolcott said that the dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the board members was paralysing, telling him that there was no indication in the budget that the support staff of the schools would be dismissed.
Representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had filed a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that a claim had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal claim to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Wolcott and the Department of Education of the City will be identified as defendants in the suit, and the eight workers who are temporarily dismissed as plaintiffs are all black or Latin American women, as are the majority of assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's law department, said that the city had not seen the suit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint in the New York Times, the union focused on a number of lay-offs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He indicates that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island, and there were few in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school assistants lost their seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the Southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at a free secondary school in Harlem 36, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: “This is not a region of wealthy parents who can find money to make up for budget failures.”
P.S. The 36th budget was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year, and she also lost money when the city changed the way of calculating additional funding for every poor student who went to school.
The trade union also claims that the principals of schools may have been misled by the language of notification allowing the dismissal of the parents ' focal points.
The notification used the word “excess”, although “excession” is more commonly referred to when the school's teacher is moved from the school's payroll to the list of available employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents' coordinators were dismissed," says the draft lawsuit, "and not just transferred."
Mission over, Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya.
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the insurrection in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, the long-standing dictator Muammar Qaddafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is to consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (democracy, Massachusetts) together with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who praises the Libyans for their successful rebellion and American troops for their “dust”.
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country”, said Kerry.
"It is confirmation of the support of both parties for their democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has yet taken place easily.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and the White House about the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution allowing for the limited use of the United States armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority vote of both parties and was never put to the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would reduce the financing of the United States operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in some sort of legislative purgatory – when Congress is annoyed enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not angry enough to actually get the ground out of her feet.
Then events overcame Congress's indecision.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels and, on 20 October, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission formally ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee “reveals the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and endurance in their quest for freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Affairs Council or divide legislators like the June Bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans on the Committee, opposed the latter.
Luger's representative said on Monday that he had not yet seen the last version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives should vote this week for a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, a primary legislative priority for almost every republican and some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or on anything else to be submitted to the plenary vote of that Congress.
Other legislators have not yet been able to bring their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Gudlat amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues that have been introduced in this meeting.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations.
There are at least 15 revisions to the balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and more to “control of federal expenditures”.
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors, mostly newly elected Republicans who wish to decorate their resumes, the opportunity to boast that they have “promoted” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen wish to limit the number of terms of office of members of the Congress, while José Serrano, a member of the House of Representatives (democracy, New York) wants to lift the two term limit for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (democracy, Illinois) proposed many amendments to guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, as has another one prohibiting the burning of a flag.
Some legislators also wish to allow the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states object to them.
As members of Congress sought to propose amendments, they did not move faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments and in the 110th Congress 66 such amendments.
This rate will be less than in the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Library of the Senate, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but it was actually submitted to Congress in 1789.
"Backed, but not defeated," says Giffords in his first television interview after the attack.
Ten months after an armed man shot her at a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (democratic party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday night, singing a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Back" and said she wanted to get better than to go back to Congress.
When she appeared on the 20/20 program, ABC News with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to formulate proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her the hard way of recovering from a bullet injury that crushed the skull and shattered the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the draft law on the maximum debt.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang, and called her recovery “hard”.
When Sawyer asked how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the 20/20 hour special issue, which was shown on the eve of the release of the new book by the couple, "Gabby: History of Courage and Hope".
A special issue reported on the restoration of Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
In videos taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a razor on her head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to do simple things.
Nod your head.
Put your lips out.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word, "toast," asking for a change in the breakfast menu.
The video shown by ABC shows that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: we see the congressman singing along with the girls just want to have fun with Cindy Loper and Tom Petty's free fall.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she says she doesn't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband told me that he was reading a newspaper article in Giffords about the shooting on March 12, when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed at the time.
The suspect, Jerd Lee Lafner, is being held in Missouri prison and subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"It's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
One day, during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not defeated," Kelly said.
You're just beat up.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect.
The event was an event on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock was singing ballads about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
On the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines lined up around him.
The audience in the tuxedo applauded him standing up.
"The soldiers were looked at as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, which also included the then Chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," wrote the officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted to do the right thing.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The very opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have emerged between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired, American public.
The troops are overwhelmed by praise for their sacrifices.
But praises have their price, say the soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if they felt pity for people in uniform.
"We are not casualties at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and soon left for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us like unhappy people."
This is a sensitive theme for warlords who do not want to appear ungrateful or dissenting to the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by returning troops in recent years of war in Viet Nam was far worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity take place quietly and between war veterans only.
After two of his sons returned from fighting in the Marines, the retired Colonel Mark Kenshn warned them that non-military personnel would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some people will look at them with admiration because they have crushed the rebels and been to exotic places.
Others will wonder if there is “under the mask of a violent, evil veteran”, said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and, upon his return, occupied a high government post in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking him if he would be able to withstand the stress of responsible work in Washington, D.C., immediately after the fighting.
Kenshn remembers saying to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on a negative effect."
The inconvenience experienced by the military stems partly from American indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was normally in World War II,” says retired Lieutenant General David Barnow, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The troops estimate the number of journeys they have made, the number of companions they have lost, or the magnitude of the loss.
The army faces increasing pressure from anti-rape supporters
This week, the historic court hearings must decide whether 28 men and women will be sued against the army on charges of non-violence of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be in line with the next one.
Private first-class Elizabeth Lyman is 25 years old and she claims to have been raped by a coworker during the night on 11 weeks of pregnancy.
It was in October 2008, and she returned to her barracks at Miramar airfield, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend, and met a male colleague carrying a bag of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," Lyman says.
But the birth girl of Texas has been spared her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I hadn't listened to my instinct."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, a man approached her from behind, fell and raped, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 current and former soldiers will be eager to await the judgment at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they filed against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld, will go to court.
The claim states that Gates and Rumsfeld were unable to deal with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The action filed in February by counsel, Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., originally included 17 complainants, but rose to 28 in the following months, to 25 women and three men, who all claimed that they had been raped or threatened with sexual violence by fellow workers and that the army had failed to properly investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting the army's superiors because the problem starts with them.
"Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Burke also says that she has been contacted since February by some 400 other victims, many of whom may be involved in future lawsuits.
Her strategy is, instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case -- putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, she'll open up a lot of cases if she needs to keep the pressure up.
The Ministry of Defence Defence Defence team, under the leadership of the Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride, took steps to close the case.
The judicial documents that Newsweek has received reveal the defence strategy, essentially that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army for damage to the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the Supreme Court decision of 1950, Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not liable for damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs”, states the documents.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially prohibited from participating in combat, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear frontline.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
The result: Between the two wars, 150 women soldiers were killed, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the army to become modern too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her lawsuit, three others are prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar prepares a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a feminist atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a lawsuit against the army, which is centred on the diagnosis of “personal change” that victims of violence are asked to remove from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati of the human rights group, the Organization for Action of Women in the Armed Forces.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans ' Office in December, accusing him of discriminatory treatment of pension applications from people who claimed to be at risk of sexual violence during their service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures have been submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 rape attempts were reported, according to the Ministry of Traffic Prevention and Combating of Sexual Violence.
But it is well known that attacks are often not reported, and according to its own estimates, the Pentagon estimates this figure to be approximately 13.5 per cent of the 19,000 alleged cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of reported cases reached trial, twice as low as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case call attacks on them only the first of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times to the police, doctors and commanders.
She collected evidence of the rape, and the victim's blood, from a cut on her arm, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat in front of a judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend before the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive character to the accused, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was about to have a baby -- I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I left, I remember my commander saying, "It wasn't a trial of him, it was a trial of me."
Lyman was ordered to consult a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her personality change, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with an unfavourable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether Lyman and her suit buddies will move forward is a difficult issue, says John Terley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
He notes, however, that “I believe they are in a position to move forward”.
There is a doctrine between them and the verdict that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've been criticizing Doctrine Feres my whole life.
The army has fallen behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and restraints that hold responsibility.
He adds, "The Chances are very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this matter until there is reform," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens sooner.
The walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was just a regular guy who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who confessed to a massacre in Norway in July, which claimed 77 lives, appeared at his first public hearing.
Although Brayvik could act alone, he was far from alone on the net: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy, you just have to go to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not difficult to get close to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on European cyberpopulism at the British DEMOS Research Center.
The personal data on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett that researchers could easily use the website's promotional tool to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy -- that market scientists have been doing for several years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans all over Europe and then posted ads to them, but instead of showing a new group or a diet product, the ads offered the user a survey that asked about their level of education, their attitude to violence, and their optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants in 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries, not even leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to do research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not as impressive: online right-wing groups are mostly male youths who are dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more intelligent, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and polytologists use the site to study everything in the world, from health issues to social trends expressed in “Likes”, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three entries per day, Facebook's “super-actual information” has caused a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the name of the site in the headline by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook’s beauty is that it provides an opportunity to study people who cannot be reached on the street with a notebook.
"In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have had to join the party, and they would never have accepted you," Bartlett says.
"Facebook excludes all of this - you address them directly."
Others say that the site could identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunken feats on Facebook were significantly more exposed to the risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that student peers, such as their hostel mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drinking status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Centre for Child Health, Behaviour and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook also regularly extracts various kinds of data about its users.
The website's data processing team processed the status statistics for Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the middle of 2010, as well as the National happiness index (mainly using information that is only available to them - cyber free champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not, in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict standards for off-line research, online data is publicly available.
"I don't think many users have even thought that a researcher can watch their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, "about a study he did in 2006 using publicly available Facebook pages.
"As far as they imagined, it was between them and their friends."
This raises the question of methodology.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that the subject of the study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to find out how much information on the profile and on the user's page is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite years of work in the field of technology, Selwyn thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools to be used.
"Nothing can replace a way into the real world and communicate with real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social research, and most social research is still offline."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Bering Bravik will be tried for the first time in public.
Anders Bering Bravik, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that took the lives of 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a resistance fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Knights of the Templers of Norway," he said to the 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I do not confess to my guilt."
Judge Torquil Nesheim interrupted Bravik during this monologue because he "wouldn't give Bravik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravik, who had brought a written speech with him, to address the victims ' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to hold Bravik for another 12 weeks, barred him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Bravik in the eye, others making sure he's locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said NRK to the Norwegian channel, one of the survivors on Utoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally, I felt a little better after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Bravik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Bravik's strange idea of being part of a big resistance movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy, and said that there was no evidence that he was dealing with accomplices.
Some may be reassured by the fact that the 22 July attacks seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But it doesn't automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation is feeling now.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but it's not," said a relative of one victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it were."
Seven lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, which is shown at the theater this week.
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing a technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can think of as the biggest discovery in the recently discovered interview, which was remembered in anticipation of the pre-shows in the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a thorough organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from "the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 per cent of the work... [but] a great idea separates a huge amount of skilled work from a great product."
Let's go back to 1995, Bob Kringley created a TV series called Triumph Nerds about the arrival of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a uniquely long conversation.
By that time, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was kicked out of Apple, and he was already working at his new computer company, NeXT, in anticipation of the massive development of the Internet.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in the Nerds, he says the original interviews were missing during transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This film, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film, Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which is released on Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hate for detailed interviews, Jobs seems unfamiliar here to express his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
There are four different moments during the interview where there are large intervals between questions and answers -- reflections for 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments where Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems to be irritated by Kringley's questions, forcing him to move faster to questions or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Picsar era, iPods and iPhones of Lost Interview, there is something ominous prophetic when Jobs assesses what he sees different companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about postmortem evaluations of Jobs' work, but there's something sensitive and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, a troubled dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A little summary of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"For all the time in the business, I kept asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you always get are, "Oh, it's just like this."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deep in business.
That's what I learned.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to streamline reporting in Apple.
A disillusioned way of recording expenses, often starting with “standard costs” that were taken from the ceiling and then followed up with “uncertainty”, he created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business outlays up to small amounts.
About the pope joke:
Jobs details the "blue box" he made with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack a phone company and call long distances free of charge.
The device was written a lot before, but Jobs' euphoria here, describing the blue box as an act of power is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a phone machine, ordering a conversation, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the world half a dozen times, and you've yelled at the machine phone, and it's been coming in a minute later on to the next phone," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could build a little thing that could control a big thing-- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, Apple could ever appear.
Jobs continues to describe in detail a famous incident that he and Wozniak almost managed by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope to call, trying hard to copy Henry Kissinger.
When different members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two laughtered just before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and calling Bill Hewlett cold):
At the age of 12, hunting for the spare parts of the frequentometer assembly, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer job at Hewlett Packard.
"It had a strong influence on me, "it was the only company I saw at that age, "and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw the first desktop computer.
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an electronic radiation tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and go around that car and write programs for it.
On improvised innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about the invention of new products on the fly.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of installments, a buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
While working on a loan for only 30 days, he was supposed to plan both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
In Apple, he later recalls the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the violent arguments... "they yelled at me that it would take me five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], "and I was fed up, "and I came out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could raise for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About the big companies losing power:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs predicted exactly how many industry leaders would fail in the vision and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company's not getting any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these types of people] who eventually get to run companies, and the people who make the product are being pushed out of the decision-making area.
The genius of the product that led to this monopoly is replaced by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times bigger, could be the Mycrosopht of the '90s...
They were defeated by victory.
On innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea from the great product separates a huge amount of skill work ... when you twist the great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises that you need to make -- some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts -- connecting them all together...
In the end, it all comes down to taste -- it's all about trying to express itself in the best things humans have ever done, and later, trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made MacIntosh famous was that the people who worked on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best information technology experts in the world.
If it wasn't for information technology, they'd do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having lunch with the opponents of the health law while the court is considering the case.
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether it would hear President Obama, his two judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, challenge the case before the High Court of Justice, and celebrate the luncheon sponsored by a law firm.
This case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions submitted for consideration.
One of the cases on the agenda was a motion supported by 26 states challenging the rapid review of health by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists throughout the nation.
The judges had agreed to review the process; indeed, a 5 1/2-hour turning-point debate was expected in March 2012 and the outcome was likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which would be in the middle of a trial by the time the judgement was announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and argue that the health law must be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney General during George W. Bush's presidency.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen firms that helped to sponsor the annual lunch of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that consistently defends conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Independent Business Federation.
Another sponsor was Pflizer Inc, a pharmaceutical giant, who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel hours after the trial.
Mitch McConnell, a Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the Health Care Act, was present, among other things.
Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical standards at all.
Judges are in fact free from the Code of Conduct, which governs the lower federal judges.
If they obeyed, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judge may attend charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, guest of honor or mentioned in the programme of such an event”.
Nevertheless, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with great financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethical activists in the government.
“It is a staggering breach of ethics and indifference to the code, contrary to the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of General Affairs.
"The judges have been drinking and having dinner at the official fund-raisers with the lawyers who are currently on trial."
Their presence and assistance in collecting money for this event undermines all allegations of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say they're very willing to mix court cases with case groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Jeannie, is a famous conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue for Judge Helena Kagan, not for Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal service in the Obama administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the court level of the first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan never showed that she was going to do that.
Boeing gets a record 18-billion-dollar plane order.
Emirates Airlines orders 50 wide-body Boeing 777 and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal is over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company gets an order for 50 pieces of its product.
But this is an important event, when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft builder, and the price of all these 50 planes is $18 billion.
Just as important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing gold mine of future plane orders.
In a Monday forecast, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will require 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend his biggest dollar-equivalent order for commercial planes, 50 two-way Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft that will raise the total price to $26 billion, says Boeing at the Dubai Air Show 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which could boast of much better fuel savings and passenger conveniences.
The price of six aircraft will be more than $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neil Dior.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but also the increase in fuel prices, which usually damage airlines, as this is one of the biggest items of expenditure, is not so destructive because the country earns money at high oil prices.
It's important, because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the plane order when the prices rise, Dior said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the wide-flying aircraft market and helps prevent the rival Airbus SAS from encroaching on its dominance with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing won the air show four months after Airbus announced that he would postpone the debut of the biggest A350, which competed with 777-300ER.
He postponed his debut to increase the axe load after the buyers demanded an increase in the load capacity and range of the flight.
Boeing Co's stock grew by 1.5% to $6,944.
The sister of the President of Mexico apparently lost in the elections in Michoacán.
Louise Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRI in the election race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister did not seem to have fulfilled her nomination for Governor Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she stated on Monday that the drug dealers had helped drive the race for one of her opponents.
Preliminary results indicate that the leader in the race for the seat of governor of the Western state is called Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRI.
“The intervention of organized crime during the entire electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but also for the entire country,” Louise Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the day after the Sunday vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our election workers... "they grabbed the ballot boxes, put obstacles... "and forced people to vote for the IRI.
The IRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She prepares for return, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The IRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have just overtaken Calderon, who led the ratings until election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the National Action Party, or a PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Sylvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DDP, which now owns the governor's seat, came third, a serious defeat for the divided and failed left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital city of Morelia, denied links with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to accept the results.
In Michoacán, drug cartels, specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine, have long dominated the country.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still continuing.
A PND mayor was killed a week before the election when he was agitating for Louise Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local election race for fear.
For the IRI, however terrible the Michoakan election may look, victory will give the party an impulse.
The man who's supposed to represent the IRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the morning of next year."
ADB convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has instructed India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ADB office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing large economies must “do what they can” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties “insensitively” and said that Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term recession in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"That's why anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the Mumbai World Economic Forum.
"Asia may be somewhat protected, but it cannot be invulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely affected by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowings have increased alarmingly, and both Italian and Greek Prime Ministers have resigned.
The debt crisis in Europe has given rise to fears that it can lead the world economy back to recession, and has led to calls from leading developing economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian aid would be channelled through IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial aid bonds, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- was a powerful negotiating power for Europe ' s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Trade of India, said that “India will do its best” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others argue that it makes no sense for developing economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Astouche Varshny, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult politically to assist 1.2 billion people in Europe, some 800 million of whom live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point, they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go on holiday to the sea, and it won't be well received," he said.
Lee Howell, the Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greek large and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, declining enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis threatened “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
ADB's forecast of 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now faced with “smart risks” due to a threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed “emergency plans” to protect themselves from the decline and significant outflows of capital from their economies.
The Pentagon ' s fearful warnings of potential reductions in defence spending
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, set the stage for the Congress on Monday, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to a $450 billion reduction in the coming decade, but now fears that additional reductions of 600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress fails to reach a cost agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be devastating to the Ministry," Panetta reported in a letter to the senators of Republican John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the Congress’s inability to accept the budget agreement and the resulting sequestre would initiate a general reduction of 23 per cent and end many new projects.
“This severe reduction, which has been so thoughtlessly applied, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or buildings -- and will seriously damage other attempts at modernization,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We're also going to have to fire many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is going to be done so quickly, we're almost certain we're going to have to fire civilians to achieve the goal."
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and seriously damage our readiness."
The abbreviations will eventually affect the military, says Panetta.
“Although military financing in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequestre, military advances will be severely affected by a serious disruption in the core budgets”, Panetta warned.
“Contracted personnel will be reduced, which will result in the cancellation of contracts and the oversight contract that supports troops.”
“Staff personnel will be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
"The effect of the sequestration in the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand firm against these draconian actions," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday night, when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we have to impose ourselves."
“The Sequestre is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether the Panetta's letter or the Senators' latest warnings lead to a budget compromise or reinforce calls for the Pentagon's release from reductions, we'll see later.
The Panetta was completely sincere about possible reductions, although he came to work in the Pentagon's leadership after years of budgetary review in Congress and the White House, and was aware that he faced difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a depressing picture of what might follow -- troops with a shell but without a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"This is a squad without bullets."
"It's the wing of the plane without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It's a force that suffers from an unstable spirit of combat, a bad readiness, and is incapable of fighting potential enemies."
"It essentially encourages aggression."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he described new details of how reductions “create significant operational risks: slow responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be the first to deploy and respond anywhere in the world; and lead to unacceptable risks in future combat operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects may face obstacles, including those that have passed the tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 striker, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal battleship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the Army and the Marines need to replace with a hummer.
Ending further development and testing of F35 may save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and confront the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Catch on a Liar
A quick look at the last headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
A Republican presidential candidate, Herman Kane, is busy challenging allegations of sexual harassment from several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The administrations of the University of Pennsylvania were charged with perjury because they allegedly concealed that a retired football coach had raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on a microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
Congressman Anthony Weiner, and the Internet exhilarator, he made a fool of himself, denying his actions, which were quickly refuted by uncontested evidence.
A former presidential candidate, John Edwards, was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to harbour extramarital ties.
Again, none of those who lived at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was found lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of fraud at school and college exams are common.
There were times when teachers gave the students answers to the tests so that they could have a good evaluation of their performance.
Teachers who have to teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In one day, research shows that you can lie between 10 and 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to save.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Identifying lies or perpetrating lies is a necessary skill for each individual for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, which looks like, say, the charades where you need to exclaim, "I got you!", the discovery of lies is a serious knowledge-based, scientific evidence gathered over the past six decades at prestigious universities that are engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most old myths about lies have been dispelled.
Liars look in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stutter, blush, or fuss.
Do not conclude from this that liars are hard to spot and hard to expose.
An experienced liar can come to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the mimics, the structure of the questions, and the temporal characteristics.
I have spent several years exploring scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of the knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the identification of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps guide in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are excellent readers, making them feel comfortable, controlling their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried ones (but the lies they say are most often obscene).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do you know if anyone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your target.
It's called the definition of the source state.
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing changes further.
Observe the pose, the laughter, the voice characteristics of your object.
It's good to know if a person knocks in normal condition all the time, then you won't make an unfair charge when you see a foot knock in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for a group of deceptive verbal and non-verbal acts.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Deceitful people can capture the upper part of their body when they try to remember their story, they can put their feet in the direction of the door, lean towards the exit, change their pose in a certain way, or show "facilitation after the interview" -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and change of pose when all the difficult issues are behind.
Investigators often falsify the end-of-interview signal just to see this relief after the interview.
So, look at your target's speech.
Scott Peterson is known to have stumbled and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, leading to a search throughout the country.
The opportunistic people can also use distance in the speech: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Levinsky" or repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely detectable.
Someone can use a "qualification language" when answering a difficult question, "Well, to tell you the truth... as far as I know ... as far as I know."
This makes the answer emotional rather than factual, and is often a red flag.
There's no magical tool to detect lies, but you can master the trick detection skills.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not becoming the victim of skilled cons in professional and personal life.
The opposing plan for the oil pipeline needs to be revised after the US threat to postpone its approval.
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- arousing the anger of trade unions, but calming the environmentalists -- the company that is going to build the pipeline claims that it is willing to reconsider the project in order to resume work on it.
TransCanada announced on Monday night that it would remove the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sand Hills in Nebraska and was confident that the project would still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska State Capitol.
The official representative of TransCanada, Alex Purbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive approval for the oil pipeline, albeit with another route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until it examined new possible routes that did not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills and the Ogalala Aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental assessment commissioned by the Department of State is likely to push the decision back to 2013, after the elections next year, although the authorities denied that the decision was political.
Obama, in a written statement last week, called the decision to the Department of State and expressed his support for it.
The oil pipeline, which is 1,700 miles long, should extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He's supposed to move 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to oil refineries in Texas.
To do that, he needs to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate it, but they love trade unions that hope for about 20,000 jobs connected to the pipeline.
But Nebraska’s lawmakers, opposing the plan, are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department study on environmental impact showed that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source in the energy industry stated that the Department ' s auditor had commissioned a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other was whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle was sued for allegedly making her child sick of fear.
The New York family claims that the disco-diva Patti LaBelle started raging in their lobbying house in Manhattan, scaring their young daughter to the point that she threw up.
Tyrade, the performer of "Lady Marmalade", scared 18 months of Genevieve Monk so badly that she suffered "manual change, sleep disorder" and "strong fear of strangers," says her family in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on November 10, last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching a car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of a building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down for a minute.
"Someone came to me from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell reprimanded a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I'm not interested in what you're saying or thinking."
She became furious and began to use swearing -- the word for C and the word for F -- in elevated tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from a bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBell attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escorts had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The baby cried so hard, she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note to LaBell demanding an apology, but did not receive a reply.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBell are not answering their calls for comment.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not reported, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken the case for free and that the family planned to donate any money that he received to charity for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patty LaBell answer for what he did," said Davis.
“This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to the kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms.”
Climate Problems Slowed the Economy
During the first year of Mario López’s reign in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market grew, foreign financing declined and the economy was weakened.
2011 is the year that will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as associated with the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés, also called the Year of Change, which has raised high hopes for economic development, but, given the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but there has been a decline in the main economic indicators.
The low temperatures of February not only lost millions for the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth potential of the public economy, resulting in a total decline of 3.6 per cent in economic activity in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on areas affected by frost provided by the Council for Sustainable Rural Development of Mexico, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were entirely affected and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially damaged, with the main damaged crops being vegetables, maize and mut.
The decline in economic activity led, until November, to a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters, to an accelerated increase in unemployment, from January to March 55.053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, with a share of 4.53% of the economically active population, from the second quarter to 5.28%, and from July to September it continued to grow to 6.19%, which is more than 74.000 unemployed Sinaloa residents, an increase of 18.969 more than the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa over the course of the year has been overwhelmed by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Department of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be attributed indirectly to actions taken in public policy.
“What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of market liquidity to limit the resources imposed by the law adopted by Congress to combat money-laundering, since it is difficult for people who illegally own dollars to work with them, invest and use them in something,” he said.
Stopped immigration
López Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state seeking employment abroad has been limited in the US, primarily because of entry difficulties, and in the second, because once they enter, they already face very many difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, resulting in an increase in unemployment,” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of Sinaloa's labour market is becoming worse if attention is drawn to the large number of labour-related violations, according to INEGI, that 60,38 per cent of the State's active population works without being mentioned as employees in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregular registration, another reminder of employment in the State is provided by low wages; the lowest wages in the State, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was until September 5,352 pesos, well below the national average of 7.375 pesos.
Reducing FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630,697 from January to July.
For its part, the State Government's Ministry of Economic Development recorded only 17,280,000 pesos in investments during the year, which were mainly directed to service companies.
Debt
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, in July, the state government requested the approval of a 3 billion pesos loan at the state congress that would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revitalize the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and prior to November, debt benefits were not expected in any sector of the state economy.
Responses
For business representatives, Mario López Valdés' first year of government demonstrates a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011 there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
“The efficiency of the Sinaloa economy has been really low this year, we have to work hard to recover the positions lost this year, we have to redouble our efforts in 2012, we have not been able to harmonize the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowdown
López Loredo said that events such as early freezes this year stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“The low levels of the economy are the result of several events, including cold, and one of the main effects has been a slow economy, which is not becoming fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations,” he said.
Revision of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic productive activity.
“In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that there is a need to develop a long-term programme that will rethink the direction and economic course of the state, and must mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better guide government efforts.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme”, he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own manner of public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that much more needs to be done," he said.
He's sentenced for 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days in revenue - this was imposed on Navolato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney-General ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who had been convicted of a crime against health, was in this case possession of marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by the Mexican military during patrolling Cyprusano Valdés Street, in front of Post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck, carrying a black bag in a box in a car, and on the passenger seat a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused remains a prisoner at the Crime Legal Consequences Support Centre.
We need to make contributions to our work.
Public works related to programmes such as the Homeland, the Saving of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk remaining unfinished or long delayed due to lack of funds, says Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that, although the work programmes had developed so far, they were in danger because the State Government was not in a position to make appropriate contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes amounted to approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State was expected to contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny when they were supposed to give us a piece from the beginning of July," he said, "to keep up, we've started work and they've made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it was expected to make, so at the beginning of the term, the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that had not been made available in the case of the administration of the State.
"It happened to us in the previous administration because the state did not have financial opportunities to participate, and the programs continued to evolve, and this year, to gain access to these programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state has left," he explained.
Although the state authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase their efforts so that interest on them would arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny."
The court will approve the “digital television” in Mexico in 2015.
Replacement of analogues with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (JC) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which moved the so-called “digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes were not obtained to cancel it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his authority by issuing a decree detailing the steps taken to move to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the absence of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree and it remains in force.
The draft declaration, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right established by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margaret Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this point, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to disprove the decree and support the complaints, and Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
It was also decided at the ministerial meeting to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the draft in the sense that the federal executive could not determine the general rules for the measures to be prepared by the public administration.
“I also do not believe that this would have affected the autonomy of the regulator” and recalled that planning public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, State administration.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals, one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years, has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of transforming into a digital form, which includes meeting public needs, which have not only a technical dimension “as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These questions, he said, “requests the work of the entire system of public economic governance, which includes a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into the executive branch of the State”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting and had done so with the help of the executive, despite the existence of highly specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any event affects the competence of the Congress, ensures that the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly are enforced in administrative matters.
In Michoacán, the possibility of counting "vote for vote" is being analysed.
According to the data transmitted to the EPRP, the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor ' s election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of counting a “vote vote” is real with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where, according to the Provisional Results Programme (PPP), the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting 879 of the total of 6.074 protocols.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Saragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the Electoral Corps approved a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law, as the State Congress approved reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in the electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the time frame specified in the State Official Gazette Act, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJJ) decided on a constitutional claim made by the local legislature and called the state representative's vote on constitutional reform “illegal and unlawful”, as it had no right to “authorize or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of a “vote vote”, Maria de los Angeles Landeral argued that, with the adoption of suitable principles by the General Council of IWM, it would be possible to present a partial or complete count of votes by the local electoral authority.
For example, a partial recalculation of one or more ballot boxes may be made under the conditions that: the results of the records are not consistent; there is no record of voting and counting the documents in the urn or it is not in the hands of the chairman; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, the total recalculation of votes in all ballot boxes may occur when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged winner of the election in question and the second-rank candidate is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the representative of the party and/or coalition who has nominated the second of the candidates in question.
A total recalculation of votes will also be made if, at the end of the normal count, the difference between the winner and the second-place candidate is found to be less than or equal to 1 per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate is the second-place candidate in the event that the ballot boxes, which have been included in the partial recalculation, are excluded.
It is worth noting that this is the case in Morelia, where according to PDRP, the difference between first place and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even if there are 129 votes out of a total of 923 protocols.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of the Sapalinam, confirming his family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; on Monday, an examination and a mass was conducted.
According to the family, the last wish of the lieutenant colonel was for his ashes to be scattered in the Sapalinam Mountains.
After receiving condolences, along with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortés family returned to the capital, Coahuila, on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft, and the closest people attended a ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 this afternoon, he was examined by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during high school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and that his ashes should be scattered in the Sapalinama Mountains, he always said it to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortés Basio, the pilot's sister.
In her opinion, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she thinks he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother, loyal to his family."
Felipe Cortés Basio left Saltillo very young to join the Aeronautical College in Sapopana, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he was dizzy even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Martha Sagan to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopán to attend his relative’s diploma ceremony, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in his life: driving a plane.
He's on his last journey.
Shots were fired in honour of Lieutenant-Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortés Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo High School of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and made progress both in his studies and in his sports, and took him on his last journey.
Basio Cortés recently died when the helicopter he was driving crashed, together with the Secretary of the Provincial Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Basio Cortés (created), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over by the funeral office to members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martinez, to the Esplanade of the Training School, where his family was already waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned on the NL Caderate farm
A few hours before the detection, the military authorities had shown to the media 11 persons who had been detained in the same municipality for organized crime offences.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Caderita Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was found on a 1.5 km of Cadereita road towards Santiago, on a hill in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by noticed that the gate was open in a village house with a wall painted in beige and brown.
When they looked inside, literally three metres away, they found the bodies of three people, and immediately they informed the authorities.
One of the men wore a yellow shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and another man in a white shirt was next to him.
Almost one metre was the body of another person, wearing a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them lay face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no casings on the scene.
There are signs on the fence of the village house addressed to one organized criminal group by another, and there are several bullet holes in it and the gate.
11 caught in Cadreita.
The Ministry of National Security has represented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that was mainly active in the municipality of Caderate and who are accused of abduction, murder, “fraud” and secret graves.
According to published information, eight people were initially detained in the Los Alvero colony on 11 November and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a phone, demanding that they become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event took place at 0600 hours on November 12th, and military personnel made a patrol trip to the village of Old Rancho in Kadereita when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the salon.
After stopping them and inspecting them, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after these statements, at 2 p.m. on 13 November, one of their accomplices was stopped in La Trutha public land, who, when the military saw him, tried to escape.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Caderate.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to present a new government that will face the crisis that put this country on the verge of an economic catastrophe.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the Italian President on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that put Italy on the verge of an economic catastrophe and damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive body will take its positions.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner to reporters.
Monty did not explicitly say that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The paper is now well marked," he said.
Monty completed the government formation process in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy was struggling with the political and financial crisis that brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration, under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monty, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders in order to restore confidence in Italy.
On the basis of pressure on Monty to rush it, unstable markets set the income from the BTP bonds of Italy by 10 years over 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian Employers' Federation, told the reporters after meeting Monty, "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this government is Italy's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty’s chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party, Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said Angelino Alphano, secretary of the Centralist-Right Party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have resisted the government majority of technocrats that form Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular in austerity reforms.
Any blocking or halting of these attempts could lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased pressure, warning Monty that Monty’s failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish a series of his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who resolved an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would retire, the value of Italy’s debt was now at a critical level, against the backdrop of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Salvaging Italy with a government debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern euro-zone financial defenders.
Monty said that his government would exist until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to reform before he appointed a new election.
Monty said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be composed only of technicians, evidence of their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources reported that the mutual distrust and dissent of the parties made it more difficult to attempt to include political figures.
The Spaniards have more game experience than the Ticos.
Of the 22 players announced in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international games.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 games.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica is compared to the 22 players called by both countries for a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and Europe champions, number one in FIFA's monthly ratings, have a whole list of class A qualifiers, Tricolor only has a defender of Michael Ouman as the only one who has performed 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
The Spanish football players playing in the League of All Stars and in the strong clubs of the British Premier League were very active in the league and in the local championship competitions this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
It is worth adding the experience of the Spanish fury in the complex qualifications of the Euro or the World Cup.
The players, however, have limited international experience in a zone such as CONCACAF, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he is leading a list of the Spanish holkiper Iker Kasillas, who last Sunday, against England (the mutch lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of the ex-golykeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Kasillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, Barcelona player, 106 matches.
Kasillas and Javi were recognized as the best of the UEFA last week, together with another player in the Iberian team, Subisarret, with 126 matches and a 102-year-old bomber, Shalke Raul Gonzalez.
Almost close to 100 Carles Puilles with 97 games.
Javi Alonso follows them from 91, Fernando Torres from 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both from 81, Andrés Yñesta from 62, Sesk Fabregas from 61, and David Silva from 53.
Costa Rica next to Michael Umana, left side of Junior Diaz with 48 matches, and bombarder Brian Ruiz with 45.
Next, only five have reached the 30 games: Calor Navas with 31, Randall Asofefa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36, and José Luis López with 35.
The rest of them.
There are more than 30 matches in Spain for Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquetsa (36), Santiago Santi Kasorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiola (31).
There's Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murey with 23.
The rest didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Morreal has only four games and Hordy Alba has two games, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
Spain's leading player, David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres since 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz became the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernández and three times as Roy Murey and Parks.
Quintette included the country on a 20-year career tour.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true."
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, he said that the band was ready to give one of the best concerts the following Sunday at the National Stadium.
There were more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says it's also a dream for them to play in this country.
This was an allegation by a bass player and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is based in South America as part of a 20-year tour and on Sunday, the 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with a team from Los Angeles, The X, and a local band, Las Roberttas.
It's a piece from a conversation that is fully deciphered online on The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, is it a dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything's going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're very happy to bring our music there.
I'm asking because there's some loyalty to the group; fans live in tension the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat him like the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the past 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We did some great shows in São Paulo, and we hope that this brought us into the shape of this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungles, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her surf waves?
We have a lot of surfing friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as Mexico, it's great places for surfing, that's how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you've made great shows with a lot of songs.
What are you planning for a performance in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no limitations on what we can do.
We'll try to make the best show possible with a variety of songs; we'll try to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat a repertoire.
How does that work?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everybody likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in a tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This tour marks 20 years of career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us ever imagined that we would be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We rejoice in our luck, and we are very encouraged that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love to make music.
We're happy to travel to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
It's a very good thing for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the bloom of the grunge?
It's always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when a movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, a group from the same city appears, but much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We're proud and honored to be part of a Seattle band.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them, and it's an honor to be part of Seattle's sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same unit for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than there are many groups.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and secondly, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, music roads have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't be better.
Your attitude to the word was not easy; but thanks to your success, you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find the balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We take care not to be on tour too long because it's easy to get into this game by the big crowd and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what made it, without deciding to be famous and to be a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project, "Manother Love Bone"?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at the beginning, it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years and we haven't released any albums until Andy's death.
There was a lot of disappointment because it took so long, and most importantly, we were still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a picture, I think about an incredible man who was Andy, and how he made me laugh, always enjoyed going to work, laughing, talking about music and football, and a lot of friends.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you are familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yeah, the producers sent us some video offers, and it was a band that we liked most, so we're looking forward to seeing what Las Roberttas can offer live, and it must be very exciting.
Why do you always change the words at Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question to Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he's using the first thing that comes into his head.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Giser Butler, John Antwhistle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunge relevant, even though he's no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling a bit off the grunge.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's the music that's worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music better now than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, though they may sound a little positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think when you're growing up and there's been some kind of trauma in your life and you've lost a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examination.
Ex-President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the State Hospital, and his family doctor reported to his family for muscle loss.
Fujimori, aged 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which has led to his operation four times and being monitored.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of power in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that he believed that Fujimori should be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried out four tests on language cancer, lost 18 kilograms in weight, with other diseases, such as a strong erosive gastrit, pancreas cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulatory problems in his legs, listed by the doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Special Operations Police Department.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the army ' s extermination force, which operated secretly during the first years of his reign.
Mujika is going to Mexico to strengthen political ties.
An official delegation led by President José Muhika of Uruguay, composed of several ministers and businessmen, will come to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Mujika will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderón, the most important item in the extensive plan to meet with the political, commercial authorities and the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to a timetable published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalajara will be “favourable for the exchange of information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership has published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking support for Calderon for Uruguay in an incident with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy listed the South American country as a tax haven at a G20 meeting in the French city of Canne.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that remained tax havens from the international community, a statement that had provoked Uruguay ' s protest and resentment for consultations by his Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the most developed and developing countries, and in fact has had an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to expedite the conclusion of tax exchange agreements to leave the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's grey list, drawn up from countries that do not enjoy international standards of tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
A mustard plumber will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's evil paws, but he never did it in three dimensions before: at Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in stores around the world this month, has been designed to take into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which can play in three dimensions without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell us how stereoscopy without glasses will work," said Nintendo's head of press in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game specially designed for this platform" because until now, successful products like Star Fox 64 3D or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adaptations to existing games.
Nintendo stated that, despite its existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "available" video game that allowed you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once they start, most experts will go "second round" to the levels of the game, which are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D Aggressive" or something that only affects the depth of action, but that needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome a variety of obstacles and "do not yield to optical illusions".
This super Mario invasion in three dimensions also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the show and repeats the successful formula from the previous games, a plumber with a mustache has to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the Luigi Player.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo had begun to hold him accountable in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the process by which Guatemala responded to a request from the northern country for the extradition of Portillo to be tried there.
At a press conference, Kolom said that his decision related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he had not “handed hands” on legal decisions and had accepted all the extradition procedures he had ever known of.
Together with Portillo Sergio Roano Marrokin, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Kolom has done shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-heads of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CPC), Portillo will be extradited once, with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of the Q120 million embezzlement in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a pre-removal process, but the Ministry of Public Relations filed an appeal and reopened the case.
Trijove helped 6,000 at-risk youths
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Trijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people prone to social exclusion have helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for a ceremony held in the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijov was born near the Trinitat Velia in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or marginalized.
Yesterday's Sant Andreu celebration brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The different political representation during the elections revealed the unified nature of the work done by Trijove.
Following the President of the Generality, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, an ex-consultator of the Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and an ex-leutenant of the Mayor and the current eco-socialist, Ricardo Gom, a member of the municipal council, attended the ceremony.
The current Social Welfare and Family Adviser, Josép Lewis Cleris and SEA for Social Work La Caixa, House Lanapa, also appeared at the Fabra I Coats.
He said that Trinijov was born in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work done so far was "a good base."
The President cited Trinijov as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and the instilling of hope in people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to the organization and the work done to her," he said.
The building that was seized, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated.
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without a fight.
It seems that the nightmare of the neighbors living in 51rd Street on Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building yesterday at noon, which they illegally occupied, and where they organized mass parties that irritated the neighbours, by court order, without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"As of now, there's going to be a pass check," said the manager.
The squatters, who took 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest were inhabited, took all the electricity and water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially alcohol cans.
The first three floors were a mass party site, which lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
There is a nightclub, Balmes 51, just outside the building, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her income had fallen by 80 per cent since the building was occupied.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the building dragged her into an unfair competition because they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for ten.
In addition, the discotheque owner had to respond to the noise complaints of the neighbors, although she observed that the noise was caused not by the club's visitors, but by the people in the squat and, above all, by those who attended the parties that organized there, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now, he has forgiven her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks more complaints had been received from neighbours about the situation.
The chairperson of the PP municipal group, Alberto Fernand Díaz, demanded last week “to evacuate the building immediately to address the problems of coexistence and shared spirit among neighbours and degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that, until summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the last few months, squatters had invaded all floors and virtually every room, and that some had been broken into.
In this sense, he added that “there is a need to put an end to impunity and to resist the culture of the building.”
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building in Noo Barris.
At 3:30, the police left for Montral Street, 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a contest after the contrition of contributions
The 16-door municipal competition reopened the debate on the role of Colcerola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the rise of the now-defunct Barcelona Capital Corporation (BCC), this administration printed posters for Kolserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a large park in Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the SSC, in 1987 the park took its place again in the minds of many as the highest point in Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few who are not focused on the north-south but on the upper (mountain) to the lower (sea).
The positioning of Colcerola as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as a Yogi bear.
That was until September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates to Kolcerola.
The gate means the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gates on the field.
The question is, Colserola, a park or a mountain?
The competition, and its organizational side, and its impact on the city, is a topic for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
It's almost the most recurring topic to be discussed when two members of this chosen clan recognize each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads to exactly one of the few overlaps between what the three architects of Barcelona say and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: The competition is appropriate.
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes “necessary” to discuss the “front side of the mountain” when the offer of Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
"We have to assume that Barcelona's biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, because of its excellent availability.
Colserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title "Collserola Gate" contains a "word trap": we should not think of them "as the entrance to the park, but as limiting certain areas where we should act."
Modolo, like Roldano and Bayona, with experience in urban construction, called the proposal “an intellectual challenge” with “some dangers”.
Risks arising from the “uncertainty of prediction of public space” after the experience of the 1980s, which ended at the Forum site of its “swan song”.
The first fear is the very limiting of boundaries where you can build.
“Restriction of something is the preparation of the next step”, is a transition.
"We have to think about new urban planning tools, because current [in the case of the Capital Master Plan (GSP)] can lead to real trouble."
Closer to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Kolserola Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic question.
Modolo remembers that there is already work done outside of Calcerola that "do not miss his ears," although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers to join the project "from the very beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of a mountain to a city is a pass that allows architects to enter into a debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is something that should be directed by interdisciplinary teams (“success”, he claims), which should have created: “Architectors should only be an instrument.”
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that asks the name of this part is complex, because the rules of the competition lack the general appearance of Colserola: "The 16 overlapping competitions were announced," he says, "in the sense of the sea and mountains, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the whole area."
This leads, at least in his case, to 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for one gate may overlap with a programme and definition of an architect for the neighbouring gate.
From your point of view, the council must guarantee that the strip directly above Rhonda de Dalta should provide its completeness in an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the judicial representative of Red Casino pardoned the brother of the mayor of Monterrey on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legal representative, Red Casino, has pardoned him to the Second Criminal District Court, which is in the process of extorting the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution to allow the Monterey authorities to allow a secret operation in a gambling house.
Following a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor ' s brother and, on 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old capital of the State.
He remained there for 49 days, following the second order prohibiting movement after the prosecutor had ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereita for allegedly extortion of half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in a prison with a moderate isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving in the municipal prison in San Nicholas in Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by Jorge Yanes, Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, who said that, after almost two months of investigations, evidence of Jonas’ guilt was sufficient, such as the levying of 1.5 million pesos from bookmakers in exchange for authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to seek pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so he could be released in the following hours.
During the trial, the Public Prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether he had compensated for the damage and whether any of the partners in the gambling house would grant a pardon, although the lawyer had tried not to spell out the name.
On the basis of record 197/2011, a legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal and no further statement could be made regarding the process that had been planned against him; nor would any compensation or punishment be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookie, at almost 3:50, Larrasabal Breton was ordered to be released immediately.
The court officer, Jorge Janes, went to the San Nicholas prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and that his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hacome tells us about the details of the disaster that killed the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results of the accident, in which the Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven others were killed, showed that the helicopter had hit the ground in complete integrity, without the pilot attempting to land in an accident.
During a press conference, Dionicio Pérez Hacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft ascended, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the vessel had several contacts with the ground, and the wings came into contact with trees 25 meters where the medium lost the fluid."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the necessary requirements for the carriage of persons.
He also said that the studies carried out in the area of impact did not indicate the presence of parts on the ground.
“The study states that there are no components of the vessel elsewhere, and the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
“The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for the transport of passengers.
The earth in this place has a slope of between seven and 30 degrees.
So far, the secretary said, the main thing was to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study could take a few months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that the presidential helicopter was driven at cruise speed during the attack and that it was on soft rising soil.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal flight manoeuvre at the moment of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Perez Hacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must be visible during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft headed towards the border between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It's possible that because of the cloud conditions, the team was looking for a lower height and greater visibility in the Cuernavac Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft's radar are the same, probably without a loss of control or a change of direction prior to the impact.
Scatter of debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact occurred on the front and side lines.
The fragmentation of the debris indicates that the helicopter encountered the ground in structural integrity.
There were no apparent signs of fire or explosion:
Unexpected evidence remains in the disaster zone in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies have shown that there may have been multiple contacts with the land.
In situ work, pieces of aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above sea level, with a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The images show the sequence in which it collapsed along the way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough study in more territory than the marked zone near the site of the disaster, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the attack occurred in structural integrity.
MSS announces the obesity gene search program.
Social protection leads research on obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, which is known as the protocol “Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescents”, which will provide an estimate of signs of overweight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Biochemistry Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (prepared or not) is invited to attend MSSI sports centres participating in the study to the Mexico Valley, where tests will be conducted with children from 8 a.m. every Saturday.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be run at a sports centre in Cuautemok (West of Mexico) and that, since 8 October, events had been held at a sports centre in Nesaualcooyotl (east of Mexico City).
Once the target of between 500 and 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Centre (Süd of Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of Mexico City).
He explained that the aim of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics for the development of obesity and to identify the risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerate diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day will be observed and the main objective is to gather 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14, with parental permission and supervision, to complete individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometry of all participants (weight, growth and waist cover), blood pressure and levels of glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify genes associated with child obesity) would be carried out.
Cruz Lopez said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in the weight of children.
Medical studies carried out between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there has been an increase in only 6 years: 77 per cent of boys were obese, 47 per cent of girls; overweight also showed significant growth,” said MSSI.
He said that the validity of the search for markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other peoples in their genetic history.
He reported that, on average, the Mexican is 65 percent of the descendants of American Indians, 30 percent of the descendants of Europeans and five percent of the descendants of Africans, and this condition has affected the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main effect of obesity genetics is the inability of the body to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and it is postponed as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, having dark folds around the neck (cants) and forearms means there's a possibility that metabolism and even a prediabeth are disrupted.
The information is kept confidential, and the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in lifestyles that must be made to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main causes that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sitting, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day in front of the television and using small distances of transportation instead of walking.
It is also due to the high consumption of calories, i.e. the increase in the consumption of sweet beverages and carbohydrates (mamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high levels of fat and protein and genetic predisposition analysed in this programme.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of best quality resistant to environmental and temperature effects.
If the signals sent by road cover were to be addressed, it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the Metropolitan Valley of Mexico City, says Rafael Herrera Naher, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of asphalted road surfaces are correct, the number of pits can be reduced or reduced altogether.
In his lecture, the Technology View of the pits, read during the International Year of Chemistry, reports that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of characteristics close to bitumen but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus to resist the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the hardest part of oil, was a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some were a high molecular mass called asphalts, and others were a low molecular mass called Maltens, which together gave road cover to its characteristic viscosity.
The viscous behavior of the bitumen is the fact that in high tempmeratures about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains almost solid, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not permanent, but changes during the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, by a chemical engineer.
The chemist observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible surface, composed of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen made of small stones, put into bitumen and then compressed.
Every stone that forms this coating, he said, is loaded in bitumen.
When vehicles are moving and effort is applied, this helps the forces to be very well distributed on the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they'd be even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt cover, he added, there is the last layer, called the deterioration layer, which is made of small stones, actually sand also immersed in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the transport, it must have more resistance than asphalt coating and provide for road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and disseminate these forces, the wear layer also requires adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it has a significant impact on asphalt.
When the ground is raw, the water penetrates the surface and it's hard to get out of there, it makes all layers of the surface softened, and hence the formation of pits.
In the formation of the pits, he said, the first thing to wear is the wear layer and then it only affects the bitumen, but the damage doesn't happen instantly, which is a process that should be taken into account at the first signs of maintenance programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transport is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each coating layer must always be linked to the transport load and must be guaranteed to meet this requirement in order to prevent the frequent occurrence of pits.
Rafael Herrera said that a lot of bitumen still needs to be studied and done, for example, with bitumen emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help to repair pits lightly and without high temperatures.
What wasn't enough for Valle to be the new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of the reasons that prevented Serena Melina Ramirez from obtaining the crown of Miss Colombia.
Representative Valle won the princess' title 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has only to want the crown of Miss Columbia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna was to be satisfied that she was on the runway of the winners with a silver crown and a ribbon declaring her the new princess of Colombia.
In the light of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantica won the crown and scepter, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but who were declared princesses, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanca (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hisei Alure Garces (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie Garces Alhur (2008).
The question that many now ask:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in every performance demonstrated that she had everything to be a new Miss Columbia, for a reason she was elected the Queen of Police and the most beautiful face in Vogue, titles that the Queens had, like Tatiana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who won the crowns of Miss Columbia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to answer the question, "What book characterizes you and why? " by Martin Murilla Gomez of the Literary Society, let's read it.
She said to the person who asked:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I certainly think that the book that characterizes my childhood, "The Little Prince," is a pretty deep book.
Today, I read Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read, and at the moment, I am reading the book of Irina Nemirovskaya, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Hot of Blood.
The answer, which the jury did not like because of the term “culture” and, secondly, because he did not specifically explain how each of the quoted books described it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and satisfied with her outcome: "the universe is wise, what's going to happen."
And if you'd all like to read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses presented, Valle was burned by favoritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that, because she was preferred, she was ovated, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster'sculinary competition, the audience vote for the best national suit, and Queen Mother), "which provoked the jealousy of the other candidates, provoked the queen's stress and, as a result, she did not shine on the stage."
And that was observed during her first appearance in a bathing suit on Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both of them, she was noticeably lacking the strength and energy that Magdalena and Atlantic women had shown.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at RCN, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess "means that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition doesn't become queen."
In addition, representative Valle had recently avoided communication with the press, and that had been wrong.
Another hypothesis is that representative Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why, two days before the choice, Lucy Doty, a member of the international jury, said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Columbia, we have to look not only at the looks but also at the public consciousness before they take part in the competition, they have to be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also a suggestion that the representative of Valle had sinned by defects on her buttocks and fibrosis, which was seen on her belly, but this is controversial, as the jury emphasized her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen Jorge Hernan Orosco's consultant notes that Melina had a better body than she had, "but problems with fibrosis on my stomach, which I didn't really notice, caused her to lose her glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Oyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she was subjected to surgical intervention.
"Operations are good, but representative Valle doesn't know how to make them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize that was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the cruel prediction came true last night, they say it was a decoy that Raimundo gave to Melina as compensation for losing the pleasure of the crown.
Whether or not, the fact is that Melina is now starting a year of government, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that enables her to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions directly identified by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of the man who identified Alfonso Kano's body.
CSI from Cali came into history as a man who confirmed Alfonso Cano's death.
The work of these officers is crucial.
On November 4, CTI Cali entered history as the man who confirmed the identity of FARC head Alfonso Kano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI forensic experts, Elizar González, a man from Puerto Tehad, had been in the line of custody for 21 years this week.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to travel more than five days through the jungle to reach the location of the bodies that had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and, after completing the course, became a forensic specialist in the field of skin friction, i.e., palms and stems.
During the week of Elizar's operation to identify a man known as Alfonso Kano, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Cauca to Palmira.
He knew he would need to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the place where the body was located, he did not identify it by its appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He had no beard, dressed like a local farmer, no glasses, and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, shovel, and flashlight, Elizar compared the body's fingerprints to those on the photos.
His eyes did not fail: it was Alfonso Kano.
The same night, the Puerto Tehad representative was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that it was the head of the FARC.
Searching for Fingerprints
For a fingerprint specialist in Sijin's Kali unit, the confession received from President Juan Manuel Santos, Elizar González, at a press conference on the operation against Kano, is particularly significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopie is a rigorous science, not a mistake, it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, the fingerprinters are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and identify the detainees.
Many offenders have false or undocumented identity cards at the time of detention.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in the event of the theft, he had to carry a piece of the wall home because the thief was clinging to a safe full of jewels and money.
"It's hard to work with walls because they're not comfortable surfaces to take prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole palm and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he claims.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder-related cases.
A dead man with bottles of liquor around him was recently found.
During the investigation, it was found that a relative might have been suspected of committing the crime and indeed the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although it doesn't guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
The CTI fingerprinting specialist explained that a chemical or physical reagent is applied to the locations where the fingerprints are present.
When they appear, a blade or tape is used to remove them.
The prints are then sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or entered in the register.
"The problem is we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI television program.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves prints on it.
However, if possible, a comparison shall be made.
"The angry people" challenge the New York authorities.
Hundreds of protesters camped in front of Zuccotti Square.
Some protesters heard the court order to disperse the demonstration from the square and went to the park next door.
The Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to infiltrate, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to seize another Big Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters congregated at Zukotti Square, where they wanted to go, thanks to a court order that allowed angry people to camp in the square, while another part of the movement responded to the riot by taking over the park in the north of the city, where further arrests were made.
"Our idea is that, since the court won't allow us to camp in the square, we'll build a camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a member of the "Take Wall Street" movement.
Bray explained that the response of the angry people to the evacuation of the tent city, which was ordered personally by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, was brought to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, the “frequent people” began to seize a new park located at the junction of the Canal Street and Sixth Avenue Central Streets near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least an hour they could have taken the place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not tell the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization asserts that several hundred people were standing with tents in the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support to the members of the movement by trying to mediate negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zukotti Square, which is a private domain, remains closed pending a trial scheduled for this Tuesday, which will review the legality of this morning ' s protests.
Some of the protesters on their way there carried and distributed copies of the court order at the same time and even provided copies to police officers guarding the square, leading to “some minor clashes”, said Bray, who stated that some police officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Occupy Wall Street movement and from forcing them to comply with “laws that have been issued since the beginning of the seizure, or prohibiting demonstrators from re-entering the park with shops and other property used previously”.
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators had been informed of it, but local laws prevented them from reopening tent shops and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out, and the decision was made because the protesters were “infringing the law”.
Bloomberg said that he had ordered the square to be cleared, as it became a “place where people came not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others” because “some businesses had been threatened” and neighbours feared “for the deterioration of the quality of life”.
The evacuation that took place this morning was repugnant and shows that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” added the representative of the movement, who denounces the mayor for “disrespecting freedom of speech.”
Those responsible for the Wall Street Harvesting also indicated that they intended to organize “Grandiose Actions” on Thursday, in cooperation with social organizations and trade unions, in order to recall the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Buble and other distinguished Canadians, she will appear on the television program "The Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1.
Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "The Big Repair", rescuer in Malibu's Savers, Bunny in Playboy, wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private CTV announced today that Anderson, along with a dancer, Michael Buble, and other distinguished Canadians, would appear on "The Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1, as a very special Mary.
CTV today presented footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread web-based home pornographic video, appears with her then husband, drummer Tommy Lee, dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll depicting Jesus in her cradle.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently performed as host of the "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" tour, Charlie Sheena appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian singer named Bubla, who married Louisiana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, is a special Christmas show on CTV.
Buble recently called the American woman Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan Restored by the Earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent because of domestic consumption and ended the fall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has caused a nuclear crisis, a terrible catastrophe carried over by the rising sunland since the Second World War.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo government, the material losses amounted to $300,000 million, a blow that seems to be passing despite the dire global situation.
After three consecutive declining quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September certainly helped turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5 per cent over the previous quarter and by 6 per cent annually.
Registered in the second quarter, the fiscal year for Japan starts in March 2012, also represents the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery may be partly explained by the revival of the purchase of machinery for the reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami that followed.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a decline of 0.9 per cent in capital expenditure, which was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian momentum, which calls for the use of the crisis to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has been awakened mainly by the growth of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japan ' s GDP.
This figure has increased by 1 per cent as a result of increased costs for cars, travel and rest.
The yen’s Mark
Tokyo provided the domestic market, when the yen, the Japanese currency, became one of the “currency havens” chosen by investors who wanted to get rid of the euro-zone debt crisis and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that presses, like stone, on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sonia, for example, blames the yen for their low figures from July to September.
As long as markets continue to be under siege by the EU’s peripheral countries, the government of Esihiko Noda does not reduce vigilance.
We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, said yesterday by Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator that predicts the fractures in the world economy showed that the major forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the average of 100 points after it crashed eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives rise to doubts
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatives wouldn't sign any written commitments.
With peripheral risk and uncertainty in parks, Greece continues to wander through the maze that leads to an end to the large European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new transitional government of Ellad is imposed on Brussels’s demands rather than on the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient to apply them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, said Papadimos yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will result tomorrow in a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform of the civil service disciplinary code and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, the message of Samaras does not clarify his position: “We are willing to help the transitional government, but we promise nothing.”
The leader of the conservatives has done one step more in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, the organizations that should defrost the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and he has explained that he will not give his approval to any letter of consent to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritating by the effect of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demands were clear: it would not resume assistance unless the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties signed “a written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible”.
Amadeu Altafay, a representative of the Ministry of Economics, said that Troika inspectors could “very soon” return to Athens to discuss with the new government “what must be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been set.
There's enough thread in the Greek cavity for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope."
The Queen emphasized Spain's “primary” position with regard to this type of finance.
Spain “has a prominent place in the world in the area of microfinance”.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor to the instruments of cooperation, whose “essentialness”, she said, is that it is “a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on faith in people”.
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolide yesterday, convinced that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “perfectly necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “especially with a view to halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is recorded”.
Spain “already works” to expand the network of recipients around the world and assumes this task with all “responsibility”, says Doña Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people, especially women, “the main recipients of these loans”.
There are "many achievements" and "many difficulties we face."
The Microcredit Summit becomes not only a forum for debate, but also a platform that promotes “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services by the end of 2015 and that 100 million of these households would escape the poverty in which they were immersed.
The impulse to establish a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world “walked along the path initiated years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Ms. Sofia as “a fair act and an act of recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as “a marvellous idealist in the universal fight against poverty”, whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to explore his lending policy locally.
This experience took over the first World Summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “everywhere I have seen continuous development”, said Her Majesty, whose connection to the project gave her yesterday the title “head of the family” gathered in Valladolid by the poor's banker.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her statement by calling on those present to participate in the debate and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative."
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez said that solidarity was an “ethical imperative” for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, since it was a “permanent commitment”.
Jiménez concluded that microcredit implies a “serious and firm course of action aimed at eradicating poverty” and that “more than ever” developed country Governments must work in solidarity and not be allowed to fall victim to cost reductions.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, commended the “success” in giving “confidence” to people who have been “opened, all doors closed” and Mayor Valladolida Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all those present in a city that “opens its doors in a spirit of solidarity”.
HDZ proposes to elect the Chairman of the European Commission by universal vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CPU) on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without major problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it was in the fall itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is far from as strict as it should be today with regard to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with respect to Italy....
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, which had been tabled by the management, had been adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The standing ovations, which lasted a few minutes, deserved by their statements by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schoible, the Eurofile and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main message of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is “not less than Europe, but more than Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, it's time for a breakthrough in Europe.
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty that make it possible to strengthen European Union control over eurozone financial policies, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a universal vote “to give Europe a face”.
In any event, it is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Schöble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly accept this decision; Britain opposes this, and HDZ leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member country in the European Central Bank government according to the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In an effort to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kole, but she did not seek to influence the Congress at the expense of “small” European countries or countries in distress that like to criticize the “higher” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devoted an entire paragraph to the importance of “Germano-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just passing by.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What's a hospital leaf fraud?
Following the cash benefits, the UMP and the government launched an attack on hospital lists.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will come to Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefit Fund and give a speech on this issue, which has been regularly raised since 2007, on combating social benefit fraud.
And to help this attack, which arose out of the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also part of the right-wing presidential re-election campaign, most want to concentrate on hospital leaves.
In the first place, with a view to budget savings, the Government intends to impose on private companies the fourth day of unpaid leave prior to the payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the employer ' s special consent, the sick worker will lose his or her salary in four days at a minimum of 15 per cent of his or her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to create a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, imposing one day on public servants without sickness benefit (public servants have not yet had to wait for payment of the benefit, as opposed to a three-day waiting period for private sector employees).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority is also raising the subject of fraud again, with a view to the abuse of hospital leaflets.
Control will become more stringent, and in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all the illegal payments you received,” Xavier Bertrand warned Xavier on RTL on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital sheets.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subjected to constant control and political attacks that bear fruit.
The people in France are no more ill than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the country figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of Health Economics, daily compensation costs of Euro11.3 million in 2008 amounted to 5 per cent of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent related to maternity leave and accidents at work and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, which amounted to Euro6.2 million.
Consequently, 2.5 per cent of health-related costs were incurred.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group study.
The average arithmetic, which conceals some of the irregularities; another study published in 2007 by the Monster.com Career Management website revealed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers interviewed said that they had not taken a single day of hospitalization.
Another study, this time concerning health insurance, states that in 2010 37 per cent of hospital patients lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to 1 month, 15 per cent from 1 to 3 months and 11 per cent longer.
If these figures are compared to those of European neighbours, it is clear that French workers are no more likely to take hospitalization than those of any other country.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers revealed that between 1994 and 2001, the total unemployment rate in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10 and 11 per cent, compared with 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital sheets is very low compared to grey employment.
As for the level of fraud, it's very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has led to a systematic examination of hospital conditions for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term illness reports were “unjustified” or too long”, which amounts to 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital sheets for more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unjustified”, which is 132,000.
Overall, 169,000 cases were “unjustified” for several million workers who received hospital forms.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, grey employment figures.
According to UMP delegate Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on the matter, they amount to between Euro9,000 and Euro15,000 million in the annual shortfall of the budget, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation and is therefore infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos announced this on Monday, 14 November, adding that the 100 days allocated to his coalition Government were not sufficient to carry out this task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme”, said the head of government, who made his first public statement, opening the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the “primary task” of the new government, since the country's presence in the eurozone was “in the process of being at stake”, he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos forecasts a reduction in the country's budget deficit to “approximately 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new Government's measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with deputies from his party New Democracy.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but also with his rejection of any course that impeded economic recovery.
Ollie Renu, the European Commissioner for Economics and Finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary credit of 8,000 million euros without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with extraneous assistance, claims the committee of experts.
Canadians are denied death, as stated in a report by the Royal Society of Canada.
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee contends that the government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, excluding cancer.
The Canadees are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which brought together six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Penal Code to allow for extraneous suicide and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient may be considered competent to make such a decision.
For starters, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Office, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is ranked 10, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6 per cent of them end up dying in the hospital.
Québec has the highest rate in the country, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and extraneous suicide, the report concludes that it is contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the penal code with regard to euthanasia and extraneous suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse of use, i.e. euthanasia or aid suicide against people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, at a teleconference, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed most of these cases in countries where euthanasia and suicide with aid were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is apparently illegal.
Suicide with extraneous assistance is practised in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 percent of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia because, according to an Angus Reid survey in 2010, they believe that this will help people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66 percent believe that legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are of less value.
In the case of people who had assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of those interviewed believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest, among other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that legal termination of medical care is not an offence.
The Committee of Experts also requires health professionals to be trained in a spirit of respect for the abandonment of health care at the end of their lives without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee called on the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminological secession already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to quench physical pain like euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some health-related law experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metre Pierre Deshan, a health law expert, described the “extreme” position of the experts who signed the report, as, among other things, it did not limit the use of euthanasia to death.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years of age can ask for help in committing suicide, says metre Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metro Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the independence of the individual above all other values that formed the social fabric of society.
He said that "there are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
Margaret Somerville, a health law expert, also expresses “a categorical disagreement with the findings of the report, which she referred to as a “manifest for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, inter alia, the report concerning abuses in some countries where euthanasia and extraneous suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to give way to power.
Damascus condemns "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar Assad's supporters held a demonstration in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure increased on Syria, Bashar Al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, resisted it and condemned “conspiracy” against its country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria ' s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened the sanctions against Damascus, and Syrian neighbours Turkey and Jordan advocated the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar Assad to give way to Syria, where some forty more civilians and members of the regime ' s armed forces were killed.
“Had Bashar been expensive for his country, he would have had to resign, but he would also have had to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life,” said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey regretted that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which had begun earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who did not live in peace with their people and could not satisfy their aspirations would lose power, he said, in hindsight on Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey was increasingly hardened.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “extension of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly tough course against repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department.
Since then, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime ' s armed forces have died in the Dar ' a area of southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and firing of heavy machine guns in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.”
He also reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he said, "This plot against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers to be deployed in the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppe, also advocated the dispatch of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime he said had fallen into a “paranoia”.
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the 2 November crisis recovery plan, which includes the withdrawal of armed forces from fighting towns and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday called the League of Arab States' decision “incorrect”, while China called on Syria to implement the plan to emerge from the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from markets and Italian victims.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monty, asked the markets for a little time to form their team and execute a program that would require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s reign.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet composed of technocrats who are not members of Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a multi-victim programme, said Francesco Nukara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups participating in the discussions following a meeting with a candidate for the post of Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he would wait to see if Mario Monty would ask Parliament to vote on trust before Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with the submission by Mr. Monty of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to head of the country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bond holders yesterday, asking them for time.
With “democracy requires time to prepare the government and programme, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding.”
His appointment as president was initially approved by markets, but concerns arose again, particularly after the sudden fall of industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he also wanted to include “politics”.
The new Government would be in operation until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Djanfranco Fini, the new Government will receive a vote of parliamentary confidence on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that, by joining the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Wren stressed that “despite the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet the 2013 budget, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, had demanded, inter alia, new strict measures.
The Italian "boss bosses" Emma Marchegalya, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of the deficit."
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents the “myriad of the era” for Italy after 17 years of Berlusconism, a “professor”, symbolizing “the challenge of seriousness” and “the other Italy”, according to the authors of the frontlines.
The great unknown is the durability of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid an early election, as by April 2012, Italy must make payments of 200,000 million euros worth of public debt.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program.
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danylenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons and confirmed on Monday the United States Agency specializing in nuclear danger.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military dimension” of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years “from the 1960s on, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds with explosive methods”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to set up a company producing nanoalmaz in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA mentions “the clear signs that Iran's development of the nuclear detonators system has been facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technology well, but who also informed the Agency that he has worked most of his career on this technology as part of his home country's nuclear military programme”.
Anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined slightly or remained unchanged during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in attacks against Jews and a 14 per cent increase in the total number of religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
Since the decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is rising again, as Human Rights First, “the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, adds the organization in the official communication.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered serious violations of human rights”, added one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Lejandre.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
Hate crimes in federal law are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was enacted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation today.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook.
On Monday, the Twitter microblog site changed the presentation of its platform to allow its users to see, among other things, the activity of the people they're following, making it look like Facebook.
The new activity tab and the other name allow easier and more direct follow-up of other Twitters, Internet users whose messages ("twits") you monitor, and those who track yours.
This makes it possible to find out if they publish messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being released on the entire network on Monday, and announced to AFP that Carolyn Penner would be a Twitter press secret.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as intuitively rather incomprehensible and as using rather vague terms (RT to intersect someone else's message, #followfree to recommend tracking other users), mostly by enjoying experienced users, opens itself to a wider audience, presenting users with something closer to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the web, users discussed this innovation using Twitter on the Internet.
"It's useless, obsessive and too much like Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter stream, written by @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of the “golden rule” budget to the Constitution
The leadership of the large coalition of social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budget “gold rule” into the constitution in order to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrading of Austria's public credit rating agencies (triple A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrats, Werner Faimann, personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with Austrian public debt at 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the 60 per cent ceiling established by the Treaty of Maastricht, but lower than the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria’s capacity to pay had fallen by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by 3,000 million euros more each year, the Vice Chancellor’s argument and the Foreign Minister of Christian Democrats, Michael Spindegger.
Thus, Austria is meeting the demand of the Eurozone Summit on 26 October in Brussels; the heads of State and Government demanded a reduction in fiscal deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through the constitution or equivalent law.
The regulation adopted by the Austrian Government resembles the “German model” since Germany was the first European country to adopt this “rule”.
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and since 2017 the structural deficit of the federal State budget should not exceed 0.35% of GDP in any year, and land, like communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to force public debt to fall below the 60 per cent of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esihiko Noda
Threatens new intervention in the currency market
Japan’s Prime Minister, Yeshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would undertake new currency market interventions if the yen’s value continued to rise.
We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we consider the exchange rate of the yen to be excessive, Mr. Noda explained it to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen grew to almost a historic point that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had set a new record of power since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown constantly, driven by the purchases of investors who perceive it as a “refugee” in these worrisome times of global economic collapse and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the 105 yen symbolic bar, close to the level that caused the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar cost about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The growth of Japanese currency is damaging to Japan’s exports because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted into national currency.
Japan is fighting to rebuild itself after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), emphasized Mr. Noda, who fears that the yen growth will kill the fragile embryo of reconstruction.
The third largest economic Power in the world resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in the year, thanks to the growth in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect Japan’s “fundamental economic performance”.
Finance Minister Jun Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Manager of Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “the appropriate steps”, suggesting that no further mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting in late October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47,000 million euros), raising to 55,000 million yen (519 million euros) the ceiling of the amounts it allocates to purchase various financial instruments to satisfy the securities market.
Eurozone
The stakes are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating.
European indices undermine the risk of debt crisis.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and finished bidding at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, and London fell by 0.1%.
Owing to the new difficulties in the payment of credit to the eurozone countries in difficult circumstances, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"Concerned investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker of IG Markets quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7 per cent under the burden of new market doubts about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in a narrow change corridor until investors can confirm that the situation has stabilized,” says Mitsushige Akino, the foundation manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concern about the future of the eurozone strikes a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its bottom in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, falling by 0.4 per cent.
According to brokers, it fell after the Congress of Chancellor Angela Merkel HDZ on Monday, at which a resolution was adopted, including the possibility for a difficult country to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are substantially higher than 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
On Tuesday morning, Italian ten-year bonds reached 6.85 per cent, while Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2 per cent.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the participants.
Mario Monty, head of the future of the Italian government, asked the exchange for time to restore the situation in Italy, which is at risk of being paralyzed under the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the “primary task” of his government.
Spain was hit by markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between interest rates for Germany and Spain’s 10-year debt reached a new historical peak.
Waiting for growth figures in the eurozone
France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnating.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11:00 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be decided upon after a brief discussion or under the influence of emotion, it is an energy policy.
Accessibility and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that election meetings become an occasion to reflect on the proportion and place of nuclear power.
The dispute will not bear fruit unless all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
We now have 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will entail doubling the demand for electricity by 2050, unless the vast majority of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the increasing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to generate electricity continuously, without forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances, a topic that has disappeared from environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear power, or of Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, are only a few who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided, after Fukushima, to add one installation to its kit by reopening the construction of the station that had been interrupted after the accident in Tri Mile Island.
Although the German renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
Berlin’s choice will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased demand for imported gas, particularly from Russia, and a rise in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be visible.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European Turbine Championship, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; thus, carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy, the price of energy is the key to competitiveness and to the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will illusoryly make beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French refuses to pay, especially because they do not object to this kind of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
It is highly export-oriented and attracts an entire membership of internationally specialized small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electric engineer will order an EPR calculated to work for sixty years if the manufacturer is to close down?
To solve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy.
Areva's development of low-carbon solutions, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of safety is certainly a vital issue.
In France, we have a security agency that carries out uncompromising and transparent monitoring of existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same security obsession.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, occurred under normal conditions of exploitation, but without any human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and the unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural catastrophes of unprecedented force, which resulted in the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from the accident, as it did from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, presents a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all energy experts wishing to build a reactor, stopping it in Flamanville will be an excellent gift to Areva and EDF competitors, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best mix of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a good thing for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized on various fronts - the overload of police, judicial and administrative services subordinated to the policy of figures and the compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed status as a “human rights State”.
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which came into the news when the Minister of the Interior (Liberación of 23 May) stated that France “does not need foreign talents, stoners and waiters”.
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is much agreement between the right and the left on this issue.
On the right hand side, Jacques Chirac, who stated in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers”, and on the left side, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “can’t accept the poor from all over the world”.
Difference in generosity only
In 2005, fear of entry into the country by a Polish plumber was felt by both the left and the right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity they allow immigrants to show.
In his programme, François Hollande limited himself to banalism, saying that “joint work will solve our immigration problem”.
This notion of immigration as a burden and a problem may give an elective advantage, but it is economically expensive.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing recent immigration data (Special People: How Migration Made Our World and Determines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Publication, 352 s.), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that accept immigrants.
Restriction of immigration reduces growth and reduces employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the notion that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled workers, by causing lower wages.
But experience has shown that, in reality, immigrants complement much more than replace local labour by performing jobs that lack local labour.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most skilled work in dynamic sectors where training is not about offering jobs.
Positive effects on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between locals and immigrants has led to a positive effect on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in migration flows results in an 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
This does not take into account the fact that the diversity introduced by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (of the United States Nobel Prize laureates, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, while Google, Intel, Paypal, and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make net profits in social security systems, giving an average of 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
The World Labour Organization, for example, estimates that in Germany, when an immigrant arrives at the age of 30, an average of 150,000 euros will generate net profits (income minus expenditure) in the State budget.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was about to get caught up in the missing growth points.
These teeth, which were used to deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invents democracy, remains to reflect on European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; at the same time, it is fragile.
The European continent must remember that, by inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the twentieth century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulag, and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and the colonels in Greece.
Some believed that it was enough for democracy to finally prevail over its enemies to vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's day, the Little One has known that this is from the superficiality of thought.
Universal suffrage, although a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition, and may even be a “tool of repression”, as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vásro once said.
No, democracy requires much more -- public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political crisis and a democracy crisis.
In that regard, the palinodium of a truthful Greek referendum would have a double defamatory effect, demonstrating both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasant sense of its impossibility and incoherence.
This duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved and, in the view of many, Republican soldiers are now targeting in the wrong direction.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart Blanche" for an absolute European monarch, or jumping with his legs tied to the abyss of nationalism, what a choice for a citizen!
No, we dream not of a guillotine blade, but of a joint, clear and continuous choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis: the crisis in Europe.
All of Europe is under the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is totally humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The management of the European project must be returned to popular sovereignty as a matter of urgency.
Because only by working together can Europeans reduce the debt burden of everyone, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
A solution to the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without bringing us to a catastrophe.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the socialists and Jacques Delore, everyone now demands a European economic government.
Let's do this.
But to imagine it without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has taken place in the country is another madness and a new impasse.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to create republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a united Europe at the economic level.
This can only be done through the creation of a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true people ' s European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Uncontactable chip cards are spreading more and more.
The world chip card exhibition opens on Tuesday in Wilpenta, near Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end with 11% growth in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM phones), exceeding 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important is the non-contact technology sector, which can pay for public transport or purchases by simply drawing a map over the reader.
This year, the world will sell 460 million uncontacted chip cards as opposed to 320 million years ago!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expecting 580 million units) to almost 10 per cent of the world's chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of uncontacted payments.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest point of view: 400,000 non-contact Visa cards are in circulation.
But big shops are accelerating.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCards.
To move to a higher speed, banks must provide equipment to their clients.
"The two big organizations in France promised to systematically distribute bank cards to their clients for uncontacted use in the future," reported Gerard Nebuy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the future payment, that is, a mobile phone.
So far, few machines are equipped with the NFC (Communication of the Nearfield) technology necessary to carry out such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they have to really break up next year."
"We're counting on the world sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June of next year in Qana.
iPhone equipment for approximately 200 clients and staff will be provided with non-contact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also announced yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal to allow his clients to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spreading from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the Islamic Maghreb's links with the Boko Haram sect.
The long-awaited links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect, Boko Haram, were confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that the Algerians were now confident.
“The aid used by the two organizations and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without entering into the details.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
The investigation into the abduction of two French men in the Niger in January revealed two links.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Léokur and Vincent Delori, apparently were killed the following day, along with several of the kidnappers during an operation by French special forces.
Among the debris left behind by the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several SIM cards belonging to the terrorists.
The Axis of Terror
An analysis of the calls revealed several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one refers to a Nigerian who lived for a long time in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram cradle, and the other to a man allegedly close to Aqmi and a sect.
"This is a step forward, but no doubt we must wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the cult has received external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community, led by Washington, now exerts pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as a community of enlightened people of no interest.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at the mosque, school and imam fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is sin" - preaches the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for the sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central government.
It focuses on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuji's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead behind.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the cult is radicalizing and going beyond its northern domains.
Last Christmas she took responsibility for an act that killed 80 people in Joss and then for another one in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram launched the first suicide attack against a reinforced police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The establishment of the terrorist axis in Africa, which is coming from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a matter of concern to all security experts.
Now that Aqmi has been strengthened in Mali and Niger, and the Somalis of Al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with Presidents Goodluck, Jonathan Alain Juppe warned Boko Haram of the danger and offered to share all the available information.
The world, as the Republican presidential candidates see it
With regard to China, Iran, and assistance to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, and Rick Perry are competing in simplicity and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world with simple, or, more precisely, simplistic ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying the volume of foreign policy statements that have traditionally been a strong part of the Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and aid to Israel are often mixed.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of being nominated by the Old Good Party, threatened to lodge a complaint with the Chinese at WTO and accuse them of “manipulating his currency is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of its entire industries to Asia.
Worse still, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Obama’s Ambassador to China, and the only candidate who knows about complex foreign policy, has failed to fight a position that encourages emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stays at the bottom of the ratings, hasn't been heard.
Reagan style.
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if the sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he announced.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of failing to fulfill his promises to that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second in the candidate ratings, demonstrated a discouraging lack of knowledge.
He had recently called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing was trying to achieve nuclear power, apparently not knowing that China had it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes against Iran, says he's ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Cain, Perry, and candidate Michelle Bachman also recommend torture of suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009.
All of this is far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to lower the tone with regard to the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the “kids” from Iraq, and his manoeuvres in Libya, which gave him the reputation of weak politics.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The people consider the Obama national security balance to be positive, which eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that bind itself in the sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
Northflow, new gateway to Russian gas entering Europe.
The northern pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea has been launched.
It is designed to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian giant gas manufacturer, wanted to celebrate this event with pop.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday in the Baltic coasts, between the orchestra's performance and exquisite snacks, in the opening of the Northern Flux, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fion and his Dutch colleague Mart Rütte together turned the symbolic valve controlling the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
Under the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will flow to Western Europe every year through the first pipeline, which is 1,224 km long, linking Leningrad region to the land of Meckenburg-Memerania.
The second pipeline is to be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to the total consumption of France.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met the ferocious resistance of Poland and the Baltic States.
The Northern Flux will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany by avoiding passing through a third country (Polish or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power, making it harder for them to influence Russia, threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the most intense moment of Warsaw's debate, it did not stop before comparing the North Flow with the new German-Soviet Pact, implying an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means the question is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe seeks greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between eastern and western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of a direct union between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, which consumes large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already running out.
“This gas pipeline is part of the cooperation with Russia, it's a new artery that organically binds us,” said François Fiona, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both politically and economically important.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of gas arrival.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel in concrete to protect him from the anchors of ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left behind since World War II.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, North Flux Press Secretary.
Many steps were also needed to protect fauna and flora.
Pipeline is a long metallic snake weight equal to 242 Eiffel towers, without ruptures throughout its length, without valves or service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not thrilled that a Russian government company would permanently settle off its shores.
"In case of an accident, we'll cut the gas flow in less than a minute," Jens Müller claims.
So, in case of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will be released into the air.
But this seems unlikely to be the designer who designed stitches designed to leak once every 100,000 years.
The condition of the gas pipeline will be monitored by a submarine that pulls the ship, for external surveillance, as well as by a apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigar-like apparatus is injected into a 1 m duct pipe and pushed forward by a gas stream.
When he arrives after three full days of travel at 3 meters per second, he gives accurate information about any metal deformation.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the slightest repair required.
The gas circulation shall be carried out only by its pressure.
It is 200 bars on departure and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement the project.
Gazprom, who owns 51% of the capital, remains the leader.
The rest are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), the Dutch Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9 per cent each).
The five companies had established a joint venture called the North Flow, which had been entrusted with the construction and operation of a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters are located in Tsugu in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for 20 years, with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for the full volume, no matter how much gas will actually be transported," claims Jens Müller.
Funding for the gas pipeline was provided by 30 per cent of shareholders and 70 per cent of bank loans.
The total cost of the work would be 7.4 million euros for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they will pay for their costs because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline leaves the Baltic Sea in Ljubmin on a sandy shore planted with coniferous trees.
The vents are 4.5 meters high and form the outlet gas terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into the German gas pipelines.
From last Tuesday, the terminal gets one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It's going to be 3 million an hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine Brand Notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will restore the taste of writing.
He has the aroma of adventures, hours spent after a letter in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easy to recognize by the rectangular black cover, by the rubber, by the yellow and white pages, as if yellowed over time.
However, the notebook Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch design notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's then consultant, took responsibility for launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old technique, the moleskin - laced cotton cloth used, for example, to cover the bench.
This type of notebook is said to be highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine aligned today's taste with the old and forgotten thing that was cultivating for the avant artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the control brand at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% to 12.7 million.
We were far from producing the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish the profile of a typical buyer because the notebook attracts a businessman, a student, and a man of a free profession alike.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in Fnac bookshops, shops in small city centres, and has gained wide visibility.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter despite the advent of e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature accompanys the development of Moleskine; recently, the brand organized an exhibition entitled "The Great Way", where architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched the cover of a leopard painting on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Using his success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and Brenda has all kinds of support.
The success of the envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which added a new page to the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the general population.
Dissatisfied?
"No," says Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for the disabled."
"Big progress has been made in 15 years."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not two, but three times higher."
"But there's still a lot of work to do."
It must be said that there are still many barriers to employment for a disabled person.
Of these, 37 per cent are older than 50 years of age (17 per cent on average).
They are more likely to have low qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a bachelor ' s degree, while out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, compared with an average of 38 per cent.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to get back to work and that are the core of the problem,” says Christian Grapin, Director General Trempling, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
A study by IMS-Entreprendre, commissioned by Cité in April, revealed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability and “supposed to be full of people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally disabled”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from having 6 per cent of disabled workers as set out in the Act of 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"Today we're about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of “obligated” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from 606 million to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which raised the tax, created strong pressure on companies," Pierre Blanc explains.
“But this improvement also reflects a rise in awareness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness."
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday evening (20.45 a.m.), Eden Azar and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they had from this friendly match.
We will not be able to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the painting is symbolic.
Sitting next to Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after his attacker's game against Turkey, a Belgian coach can only commend him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his advancement and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to go further," says the player Lille.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and the team, it's one whole, he's justified.
"I'm in Lille all year long, and I'm not in Belgium."
"I have to make glasses."
Reservated, in the run-up to this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar arrived in St. Denis to finally "greeze."
Without forgetting the concept of pleasure, however.
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the 1998 and 2000 victory campaigns.
"I've always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this match.
And he remembers that there are on the other side Mathieu, Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami).
"Just our roads crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly remembered "hotness."
"The Pride" to play "the holiday match."
Pride also claims that France “renewed to be a very high-level team” just a year after the trauma in Neuzna.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, admiring him.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, a tech athlete will fly on the same plane with the Blues' leadership... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll find out in future matches, including this one against France."
Portugal is very confident
Portugal, Paulo Bentu, is starting his retaliatory match against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams seemed to lose their sense of reality on their way to him.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bentu already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the team, which has been in control since September 2010, has been classified as Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play and Bosnia to win.
Given the 0-0 on Friday in Zenica's hell, it's clear that the game isn't over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve a cherished goal that would reassure her.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk."
But at their brightly lit de la Luz Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, which should be thrilled, though the match will be very intense,” said the optimistic but sensible Benta.
"We expect a very intense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50 percent chance of getting on the Euro 2012," said Carlos Keiros' successor.
No one on Friday's match against Bosnia requires the Portuguese to win.
No one could have arranged Bosniacs.
"It's a good result, which, however, has some risk," regrets Bent.
"We're going to play against a team that has many technical merits and players have many individual merits," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosniacs from the beginning, "no time to think."
It's a good idea to be realistic this time.
