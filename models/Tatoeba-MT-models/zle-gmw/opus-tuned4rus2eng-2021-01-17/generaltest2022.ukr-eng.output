Good afternoon, I'm sorry I didn't have an Internet and I couldn't send it any faster.
Can you please tell me the exact address to the cleaning tomorrow, what's the code to the keys and what hour tomorrow guests leave and new guests settle?
I'm sorry, I have to give up your offer, because I really have found a job in this time.
I'm sorry, but I can't refuse.
I sometimes feel that, through a translator, my thoughts in the Czech language differ from what I wrote in the Ukrainian language.
We promised you we'd surprise you when you went to school.
Good day, I'm taking the course.
However, please indicate if there is time beforehand.
Because I don't live in Prague, there might be trouble with transportation.
If there are no options, I'll still agree.
Thank you well in advance.
In Herson, people went to the rally again, the Russians couldn't make it.
According to the Westers, the Shersons were able to hold a rally before they arrived to disperse the FF with technology.
"We were able to hold a rally, and now the F-Technique has arrived," said one of the participants.
In the past, the townsmen were traditionally gathered to protest at the Freedom Square, near the ODA building and the city hall.
The area is now controlled, as is the building, by armed Russian forces, which use weapons against protesters and steal people.

Good day, so it would be good if you could today as you wrote at 5:00.

They have their tickets on April 20th.
Oh, my God, let's make a good trip.
When you get here, call me on the phone.

Sasha wasn't in school today. I wrote to the teacher.
Hey, I'm sick, so it's better to move on to the next weekend, I'm sorry.
I can cook, but I like to bake.
In Ukraine, borsche, cookers, and others are traditional.
I don’t have favorite foods, and I like to go through a variety of foods in different countries.
What do you like about food?
I want to be busy.
There's a train, and there's no place.
Sorry, we're a little late.
Lucia, can I go to the kitchen as a helper?
It's a good thing Julia's going to be able to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night.
It's very intuitive and convenient.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if there will be a job for Nazar at the brewery and when he has to come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Mariupol — The Heart of War, Stop Fighting — We Will Have Weak Positions
President Volodymyr of Zelenski believes that the battle for the east of Ukraine, and in particular for Mariupol, will determine the course of war – and if the U.S.S.S.S. is defeated there, the Russians can give up their negotiations and re-emerge the de-occupied areas.
Straight language: "Maryupol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It fights, we fight, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the protectors of the city, Red.) are people who have drawn a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the EPA, and if they are stronger, the table of victory will be closer to us and we will have the advantage of a dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If the situation is weak in all these ways, we may not wait to meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities we've been depriving us of.
They can go for that too.
Then our battle situation will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we do.
"We believe in our outcome, our victory..."
Details: Greensky also said that going to talks after the torture of the Ukrainians is difficult, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
The direct language is, "People will accept peace in any case because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something – and I don't think any peace will satisfy them on any condition.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war must end in peace, or millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight — but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else, there's no people."
Good day, do you have any more space for the Czech class for adults from 7:00 on Tuesday?
If you want, you can meet your family in the Kutniy Mountain.
And these two are my binary.
Yes, I understand.
I'm not sure I can clean it up by 1:00 because it's a big apartment and a lot of cleaning.
I'll try to clean it up quickly, but I don't promise.
I'll text you when the house is ready for the guests.
Dominica, who buys the money?
Is this a permanent procedure, or should we order it to the extent of completion?
As a result of the change in the esthesis of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality state.
It's the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the status study.
the Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows for an analysis of the postmodernist context, such as where the metaphor plays a role in acciological criteria.

So, we go to work and the cost of the damage.
On Monday, we'll have the leadership and we'll decide how and when we'll be in ourselves.
Good, 'cause I've already started to watch that I've misunderstood something and been wrong.
I think it's the right thing to do, it's better to do less, and you can do better to help these people than when a lot of people do.

The Department of Defence of Ukraine’s main intelligence agency published a list of Russian military officials who were involved in military crimes in the city of Bucha of Kyiv.
According to Ucrynform, this is reported by the Department of Defense of Ukraine in Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian must know their names!
The MoU of Ukraine has obtained a list of military officers from 64 separate moto squads directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Butch,” the report suggests.
In the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is stated that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and held accountable.
You can view the list by reference.
According to Ucrynform, Irpin, Butcha, Gostomel, and the entire region of Kyiv were freed from Russian invaders.
In the liberated towns and villages, mass killings by Russian military civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, the city head of Butchi, Anatoly Fedorook, reported that 280 people had been buried in mass graves.
Irina Venediktwa, the Attorney General, stated that 410 bodies of killed civilians had been removed from the Russian invaders in the Kiev region on April 3.
On February 24, Russia’s president, Volodymyr Putin, announced the beginning of a full - scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian invaders are firing and destroying key infrastructure objects, firing massive rounds of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, jet systems of fire, ballistic missiles, air bombs.
Good day, I'm sorry, but I can't work for you because I'll be flying to Canada in the near future.
Immediately behind a dash, there are formal names, the risk is slung expressions, in parentheses, the shortcuts that are used on the schedule of hours.
I don't want to bother you. Rest.
I was looking at the forecast.
I don't need brandy.
Just nice clothes at normal prices and size.
We were at the store at the train station.

I thought after a week, but the situation's getting hot.
Tomorrow might be a bad connection on the road.
I thank everyone for their experience, even if they are painful.
I think I've learned from every situation for myself to avoid repeating mistakes.
The directives are given in the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of the Rules.
I'm sure it won't be a problem.
In Ukraine, many people celebrate this week in the same way.
It depends on religion.
Whether a man is a Greek Catholic or a Catholic.
At the beginning, you can try it free of charge.
Maybe you can write us an algory to pay for it. We can pay for it.
We have that paper that kids get at the end of the school year, it's a table, and they get a witness when they're born and married.

We promised you we'd surprise you when you went to school.
The boulob is great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouca the neighborhood doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
Photographs of people who had been shot and killed have confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other, how could that happen in the 21st century?
And I'm not surprised at all, and it's exactly what I was waiting for.
I took out children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girl coworkers with the kids, and then he went back to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I've consistently helped the U.S.S.A., and I have no doubt that, in the case of the occupation, my family will not be spared.
Because he was, and I remain absolutely confident, that the essence of the rotting Communo-CDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist; it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in Gitomir prison.
A few years ago, the Jewish U.S.S.U. was given a copy of the great-grandfather’s shooting case — over a hundred pages, and the sentence of execution was very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was unwritten, denied the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was a free man, a poor one-door high, never went to the fortresses.
The fact that they lived on the huts and had a few cows was sufficient to condemn the apocalypse and the feeding of young children to execution.
The family did not even know the place of burial.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
The name of the scissor is Charius.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informer.
The apple from the apple is not far from falling.
The shooter who had ordered the execution of the villagers was ethnic Russians.
Analysing the case of the great-grandfather, he was interested in various information resources.
There are beautiful (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia, like "The Infinite Baracke," which are reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NCVDs have found ways to punish and kill almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 to 80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalin’s repression and publicly wrote the names of the murderers — the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like they found child pornography files on the computer, put them in jail, and they died there quickly.
The KGB is killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the past century.
Then why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
There is a concentration of the most repugnant qualities of human nature.
Over a thousand-year-old Ordinary tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism began in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then a wild genetic experiment was done on what came out, cutting out the intelligence during a few waves of red terror.
Look at the 1992 half-French film Checkist, and that's what happened.
Zo, you've seen my photos in my bathing suit.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from the cough?
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I also wanted to ask you if you know where the kids went, because Galia can't know them.
Lubosh, Igor asks if you are comfortable driving tomorrow.
It's very embarrassing for us to bother you so much.
You're very helpful, thank you!

When girls return from school, what do they do?
We've come to the place where we've been put from the center in the pardubs, the conditions are good.
But there's a big one, but there's a man living here drinking alcohol and smoking in a room, loud music is the least that's "conscious," the smell of cigarettes by drunken men, and me and the kids... it's scary to sleep, to be honest.
Please help with the accommodation, please.
But where it's safe and it's not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is like this, and they smoke right here.
I beg you very much, one of them is barely standing on his feet, something is yelling, something he doesn't like.
I'm just begging if you can help.
The main thing is that we understand each other.
Very positive, such a beautiful garden, such a pleasant upbringing.
You do so much for us, it's incredible, very grateful to you.
Good evening, Stephanie, Agatha wants to be in the game, she misses the game.
We're not reaching that hatch.
So far, we're not ready to pay that kind of money, we're waiting for help, and then we're planning something.
How am I supposed to get to the apartment today to clean up?
When I'm at the front door, I'll let you know, and you'll open it?
I wanted to see if I could look at the cake for Karina.
I forgot to write to you, I'm sorry.
Things went really well last night.
We talked about children with special needs. You and their education system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shahova introduced me as a Fpoint worker, the first question was how the dog was found, how the mop was found.
Everyone's watching the Facebook page.
They asked me to give you a greeting and tell you what's very interesting for them to read the news.
They also talked about people of Roman nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child comes and the parents don't understand the Czech at all, then after work, I can help them in phone mode.
I need to change bedwear, two sets.
That's what I'm doing on holiday days.
I have free time, and we only go to great rituals.

The data was very good, thank you for the organization.

General Chapek is in a very slow turn.
Everyone has a chance.
It's important that love is real and mutual.
I don't know how it is in Europe, but in our country, people enter into marriage for different reasons, mostly useful, mercantile goals.
And I have a problem with that if I don't love someone doesn't work.
Yeah, we took my aunt home and drove her right away.
She was very grateful, and she was crying.
I told her about you and how you helped the Ukrainians.
She had tears in her eyes.
I said if it was possible, there might still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it's not necessary, only if it is. I'm very grateful to you too.
I felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had a lot of questions about God, why my life has been affected by situations that have forced me to distrust everything.
I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made meetings.
That's right, but we don't even know where it is. We've been looking for an hour today and we've been walking back. The two carpets are not suitable, so two and we need a big size.
Even now, I thought about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your father know how to speak Russian or any other family?
You can have the kids come to Wally and play in the cholesterol.
All right, let's take a chance.
I'm glad I met you, too.
I've been talking to Volodymyr for a while, and I've been advised to go to school until they find or look for the lady who lives with us, that we have to go to the metro station of the museum there is an institution that helps us find a place.
For the little one, I'm going to cross the barrier.
Some of their questions I didn't know the answer
So it would be good for Thursday, if possible.
I can't call the doctor because I haven't done a food license exam yet.
But I can't call him because I ran out of money.
I can't fill out the phone because I don't understand the Czech online banking and the Ukrainian bank card doesn't keep up.
In addition to the waterphone, I can't change the rate so I have normal calls and the Internet can never fill the number.
I'm losing my mind.
The headline doesn't sound right, what do you mean?
I'm ashamed to be unemployed.
I just wrote that at school,
I'm sorry I bothered you. I was just worried.
But it's closer to leaving Ukraine to know exactly what they're going to get.
Because there's a question in everyone's life right now.
The size is 10 to 11 years, but our size doesn't match.
I'm looking for everything for home and children.
Thanks to the people, I live in a chapel and they always ask me if I need anything, and I'm ashamed to say to myself to find it.
I just got home, I'm having breakfast.
Don't explain anything, please do that I'm not here.
could not answer without sending a summary
I can't tell my mother this:)
And I'm really a little upset right now that I couldn't keep my feelings out of it before we left the apartment... like tonight...
May God let Jura sleep. Maybe I'll go to bed and get some sleep.
I'll text you anyway.
Hey. Suzana, help me. I've come to pay for March. It's two of us and Julia, or just me, I can't figure out why this sum is.
Yes, you can take a copy of the passports when you're comfortable :)
We have one of the best heads in the village.
I'm already having fun with you, and I like it.
I went to the caritas, and they offered temporary accommodation for a week, two, but I needed a permanent home where I could be with the baby, and why there was less and less.
The flowers are polished. It's okay. Everyone's relaxed and very nice.
According to "European Truth" this is written by Welt with a reference to sources in government circles in Ukraine.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 Gaubits, including the teaching kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As also offered in the 1.2 billion euro version of the Boxer APC.
While tanks have to approach the enemy’s targets in battle, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can drive fire more than 30 kilometers away.
According to the U.K. government circles with a reference to KMW's offer, the supply of self-propelled Hawaiians is going around.
In the shortest term, the Bundesvere will give Kiev 100 of its hubitas, and the gaps that have been created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new Hawaiians can be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed by 2027.
Is this the first half of the day, or the second half of the day together?
Thank you.
I'm going to work tomorrow without a commission, and when my doctor recovers, I'm going to go through the commission, right?
How can I now change my T-mobile tariff package by 4 gigabytes for 249 kroner?
Hello, I'm sorry. I'd like to ask you if you need a worker.
Maybe the floor or the dishes.
I'm from Ukraine, unfortunately, I don't know the language, but I need a job.
I'm young and active, I'm 21 years old.
I'll take any job.
I speak Czech at the basic level, but I study every day, so I think I'm going to learn all the things I need to do to work without problems.
Something I told you today, it's probably time for you to go to bed to work tomorrow.
If I may, I'll take these pants for work.
You're smart and you're going to be fine.

So we wanted to solve the card question by Easter. We don't have an Internet banking, we don't know how to set it. What do we need to do?
To the Master in whom we live?
Say goodbye whenever you go.
Yeah, we can do that after 17:00.
Can I wash my underwear in the apartment tomorrow and unwrapped it in the garage?
Yeah, I'll be waiting for you at 6:00.
How Much I Learned From This Speciality
If it were warm, it would be very good.
I made an online application, and I'm gonna try to get off today.
We're good. With the heat, we're good, we've got the experience in Ukraine. We have gas, but since it's very expensive, we've been drowning the stove with wood.
Good afternoon, Lena, please tell me where the office store is nearby.
Tomorrow we'll go to Prague to look at the apartment.
That's exactly what it's about.
I have to take Karinka with me.
I put the laundry, I came home to translate that there's an inscription on a chair near the laundromat door to fix the canal, you can wash it or you have to shut it off.
Writes that my status will change within 24 hours, but why?
A former husband cannot calm down, write to me (sing) a real drama.
I want everything that ties us officially to him to end as soon as possible.
Thank you, because there's not much going on here.
And we've already got a piece of the crèche.
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
I didn't understand Czech that well.
I think I've come up with something.
True they go to school so three, because Gala and the Holy Slave learn remotely to graduate from Ukrainian school and get graduation certificates in autumn they have to go to higher education.
Can you tell me where to go downtown?
I'll share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the secret of two people who do not talk to one another with their family or friends.
A man and a woman decide matters themselves in their family, especially without family involvement.
Can we be together?
It'll take a while before we're around.
Why not try it this way for now?
I rented a car for nine people, we'll come with Mariana and your family.
What time do you have?
Yeah, I'm glad to hear jazz.
Thank you. I'm working on it. We've been told about it in the Czech Wednesday course.
For the past four years, I have kept no one near me, read a lot of books in philosophy, and studied myself.
When it hurts so much, it's hard for you to trust.
But you have to try again, everyone's going through something that changes it forever, it's life.
Martin, we're going to bed.
Thank you for such a nice and cheerful day.
We really enjoyed it.
We feel like we're in our family.
The children spent the whole evening telling your father, all your grandparents how good they were at your place.
Welcome girls, we're the best wishes for the holidays.
And now we've been watching.
I hope the son comes out alive from this meat cutter.
Let's go today, maybe something will be needed.
How do you get in touch with them so they can open the door?
Is there any improvement in overcoming the coronavirus?
Thank you very much for helping people.
We're in Slape right now, we're being held by friends for an hour.

For the children to attend school and for me to work, we need housing near civilization.
I just had to give it to the country today!
I didn't know even the big shops would be closed.
I make the bluebirds like this: in a pot of tomato paste, I make 0.5 liters of water, 3-4 canteens of tomato paste, it's a boiling pot.
I put the doves in a pot and pour that sauce.
I've been carving in the oven for about 1.5 hours.
How much money do I have on this room?
I've got to bring it all in.
Monday, 4:00.
4. In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine can seek humanitarian assistance at the new workplace of the Employment Administration in the Prasa Market.
The branch office in Room No. 29 is dedicated to providing and processing requests for help, so there is a translator in the area.
Lydia's been brought to school, but because of the disease, we're going to go to school on Tuesday, I told you today.
I'm sitting there, holding headphones on my ears, listening to music, and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I think we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there's gonna be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what's going to happen to the house.
I need to get a food license test, can I do that in your office?
Please give me five guests tomorrow to prepare the apartment.
Is this the fifth place I understand in the TV room?
Plan and fix the couch?
Can we stay at your place until Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one that's already benefited, but it's working, but it's not necessary.
Write the address in Czech, let's see the map where it's from us.
I don't know how much space there is so I can't plan with the furniture want this week to finally look at that apartment and then understand which furniture I need.
I'm sorry it took so long to answer, it's been a day, it's hard to adapt.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, have this opportunity to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how you feel.
For the baby, there's already a bed and a bathtub that I found for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised me you'd help me as soon as you could, but don't give me the last one.
I want to make a haircut that's called a hat.
Oleg's sick, dead and coughing.
Only I'll be a little bit later - about 8:00, okay?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
Because I'm worried it's gonna be okay?
Because we didn't even talk about it with these excarcies!
I understand how important this is to you!
I'm not talking about myself.
How are you feeling today? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Hey, sorry, I just woke up, didn't sleep well.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was disappointed that Collea and I had a bad start yesterday in translating the test.
I'm going to ask whether Gregory Denissenka or Jonaszek) to help me at least a little bit with math.
Maybe there's something I can do for them too.
If that's possible, I'd like to raise mathematical terms in the weekend.
Geometry is difficult at all, but we have to work with the Wheel so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the Test Jobs
We too look forward to that.
She's really excited about any gift.
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number.
Last night at the 402 bus stop, I met a Ukrainian woman named Victoria.
This girl is a kid, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay out of it.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And last night, thanking God for this girl, because this is the first man in Ukraine to feel my relationship.
The branch office in Room No. 29 is dedicated to providing and processing requests for help
Turns out that's why I ordered the backup card.
No, I'm just a man.
So she doesn't get scared that no one's gone.
The main thing is you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babin Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Jar.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of State, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of “the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and secure Europe.
This foundation we must defend is also part of our responsibility to our history.”
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!
Fighting must last."
Today, Russia attacks a peaceful country, bombes and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of the cities it blocks, and lets them die of disease.
Russian forces have fired massively at Ukrainians, even visibly similar to those in Babin Jar.
For over a month, the Germans see it in real-time news.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which were not so long ago unimaginable.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than just opposing the swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against massacres, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risk and sacrifice to conquer evil and stop the atrocities that take place in Ukraine.
One song for you tonight.
We agree, agree on a tour, and write when you are gathered
All were sick only Lydia wasn't sick they had an omicron new kind of horse
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
This is the ticket I use instead of the car.
Call for the lateness of the documents.
The ticket cost me 2,000 guinea pigs.
Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67 percent of the Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18 percent of the respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Gydness, the flight of Victor Yanukovic, the anexie of Krim, and the beginning of the Donbasi war, NATO’s opponents began to fall, and its supporters, on the contrary, to increase.
After the outbreak of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – over 75 per cent.
Despite the support of Ukraine for its NATO accession and the assistance it provides in the context of war, there is now much criticism of the Alliance and the Ukrainian members – for the untimely provision of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the reluctance to "freak" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its desire to join the Alliance through the Russian Federation if it can stop the war and that Ukraine will be given credible security guarantees, including military guarantees.
In the new episode of the Podcast "The Damn Question" together with the editor of "European Truth" talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of joining NATO is closer than ever before in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in the battles with Russia can become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think's here?
I have a volt partner that my application is on the table.
I've been putting it through this mobile plugin.
We don’t have a visa, we need to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was processed in Poland, where we didn’t get visas, but we got a pesel.
We'll write to you.
Denis was in a good mood today.
I made arrangements with a boy from Ukraine who I met yesterday to meet outside the school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
'Cause that's not how I love you. I'm not enough for a long time.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic sent T-72 tanks and combat vehicles to Ukraine.
I'm going to leave the kids alone waiting for three or four years and going home because I can't leave them anymore.
And the brothers are six to seven in the morning.
Yes, there was a heart condition.
I had sincere feelings for this man, but he did not do well and I left him.
After a while, he returned and asked me to forgive him.
I said no to him.
Then, after a while, he called him for a heart surgery.
I asked him to take a nap, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During that time, we had a lot of communication.
I had problems at work in parallel.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I was thinking, maybe you really need to look at him differently.
And he offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
Thus, God has chosen our own destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He only speaks Czech.
I wanted to tell you that I was able to find a place to live, and I'm very happy with that.
Should I have mentioned it before?
( ) Because I helped watch children in the family.
Don't apologize, just write the sentences you didn't understand.
I understand myself that the translator does not always translate the text correctly.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor, is she supposed to give the paper?
They must have forgotten the guests, I put them in the closet.
Maybe it's time for you to go to bed to work tomorrow.
Whether someone can help, the things needed for a woman the size of an XS or a S is 165. And for her daughters (8, 10, 12 years) Thank you.
That time in the ice, I bought two packets and my mom bought two.
It's very pleasant of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
All right, let's talk about something else, and I'm still awake, I'm still asleep, and I'm dreaming about bombing...
God never gets late, all of his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:)
I understand very well the value of under-skilled work, and I realize that the kind of work I had at home in Kiev I won't be able to have the money I made at home, and I won't get here either.
But just sit there and do nothing. I can't do anything, because then all the bad thoughts go into your head, so you have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are filed from 7 a.m. to 7 a.m., and at another time you can just wait.
Wardmire came back at 4:00 a.m.
So we took them with us.
We slept in the kitchen with Vic, and they put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to the airport with them.
When you have it, write and find out what's next...
'Cause I don't have a place anymore.
Sir, these are the invitations of Ukrainian children who will be joining the gymnasium.
Yeah, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, text me when it's convenient.
I don't know about work yet.
It's better that we change the changes sometimes?
I'm sorry, I really don't have any missed calls from midday.
I'm offering work, cleaning bathrooms and toilets, washing three windows, dust cleaning.
Work is about 3-4 hours, 800green is a one-time amount, from 1904 on Tuesday, at 2:00.
I'm hoping I'll just tell you that we're good.
Can I call you?
Or could you write your wife's contact?
Grisko started coughing, and I want to ask you what I can buy at the pharmacy.
I'd like to ask you some advice.
In our home, Hannah is considered to be the root of the name Anja.
She was handed over by her uncle from home.
Made the English version, added new partners
Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget me, please.
Mondays and Wednesdays are different?
Thank you very much, you're doing so much for our family.
You need help to stay in the pool
But that's what I think.
My uncle gave her from home the rollers and the skating board, she rolled on them at home, so it's got
I got up at 9:00, too, and I'm just making breakfast right now.
I'm very sorry you're talking to me on your weekend, and I hope I'm not very annoyed.
We want to report a change in the residence and also submit documents for the continuation of the map
We're now delivering medical oxygen to all hospitals in our country.
I also forgot to tell you there's gonna be a snack tomorrow.
One mother said she'd make doughnuts for the kids.
He's coming to your house.
Please tell me, do you have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments a month ahead, even if for a reasonable understanding of what days?
I'm not gonna remember this schedule.
The Russian army is threatening to launch rocket attacks on Kiev, saying, "We never did this before."
Conashenkova's direct language is, "We're trying to sabotage and target Ukrainian forces against objects in the Russian Federation.
If such cases persist, the Russian armed forces will strike decision centres, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously resisted.”
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kiev from the first days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian occupying forces.
On February 25, the remnants of Russian missiles that hit the Ukrainian PSP system fell on a multi-family building in the Metropolitan Postmina.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a large surface on Valery Lobanovsky’s Prospect.
On March 1, the Russians put a cart on the travelers near Babinya Yara, killing five passersbys.
On March 2, U.S. ASP systems hit a Russian missile in the direction of the Ministry of Defence building over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of a hit-and-run missile by the occupiers broke down a house and a trolleybus in Kurenovc in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential massage on the Vinogradar, killing one person, and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets destroyed the modern Retroville TRC at the Vineyard, killing at least four people.
Mer Kiev, Vitaly Clique, announced on April 13, that it was too early for the residents of the capital to leave the city.
The army explained to the local authorities that Russians could still launch rockets at Kiev, and there were many mines and unexploded ordnance in the vicinity of the capital.
The Department of Defense of Ukraine’s main intelligence agency warned on April 12, that the Russians were planning a series of terrorist attacks in the Russian Federation to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, a naphtobasa exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an aerial attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
Early in April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that a “Ukrainian projectile” had fallen near the city.
Evidently, the elites in Washington, D.C., and Berlin, throw in cold sweat from the very idea that the Nazi destroyers would kill Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky does not talk to them as much as to their choices and societies in general.
Through his speeches in parliaments and before thousands of crowds on the major cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader does something that none of his predecessors have been able to reach.
Green doesn't convince European politicians to do anything for Ukraine; it convinces the European peoples that the politicians choose.
And these speeches, this sophisticated alloy of power, the touchingness, and the times of despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
As long as the same Biden is categorically opposed to closing the sky, 70 percent of its fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels opposes the speeding up of Ukraine’s introduction, this process is already under way.
I understand, so I don't want to be considered a fraud.
The baskets you collect are better to give to people who need them more.
I can come to you, and we'll figure it out.
But the air's clean, this is plus.
It says I've got a two-on-the-on-on-the-Internet fare, and I asked you to do the Internet.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we have any other room today, or, as usual, just go from the top down?
I'm on my way to the train.
But I won't stop loving you, you're everything to me.
A financial consultant is involved in this loan.
So it takes a few days.
Katya asked for the Internet, can I give her a password?
I thought you and Milan didn't hit each other.
Super, then my husband will give me a ride because he's got a car for today from the construction firm where he works.
We are very happy and grateful that our Nick and grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you very much for your invitation!
We also hope that after the war, we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
One has to be cut into four parts.
one of these particles can be used for 2-3 days, but strip every hour
I'm interested in architecture and color.
I'm really glad you're okay.
At 4:20 p.m., the concert starts at 6:00, and then I'm free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet.
So I'll make tea and get some candy.
I went to the school page and I'm going to try and order Ani lunch for tomorrow.
But I love to go out on weekends.
So can we go over there tomorrow, find out what's going on?
My name is Sasha, and I came from Luganski to Prague.
I'm a certified masseuse and a 27-year-old nurse in neurology.
I offer medicinal massages, a rehab gym for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech in intensity.
Contact: ---- I wish the Czechs could write to you via a translator, SMS is not here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they do, you don't agree.
You really don't want this?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they have for it.
If you don't need a primelist, I won't put it on.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
Dorechi, you didn't want to write to me today... something.
Don't worry, I'm not here to ask.
Actually, I'm just asking for attention today.
I have so much to say today, so I ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, you go to work, you plan on shopping, you plan on vacation.
You have dreams.
You're planning to buy that dress you saw last night at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't take it.
He's chipping for the old reality.
You call to work, see if you can go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There's hope... it's not all for long.
Now... they'll make a deal... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
I don't have anyone or anywhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket.
Many of our leaders have not paid their wages in our work.
Where do I go? Who needs me?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything from the house... you drive 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag the kids all over Prague.
We don't know how much it's worth, we don't know how much it's worth, the kids ask for sweets, and you can't.
And from every iron, we don't have one.
It's our choice to stay there and alert the children to danger, or to try to escape here.
She was very happy with those hearts and the things the kids gave her when she came to school.
You should have called me when you arrived.
I'll text you at dinner.
Yes, I only believe in God and I believe in him in my life
I don't have the strength to do this anymore.
I thought you were in love with some Ukrainian girl and you didn't have time to talk.
I figured it out on the menu, I even ordered it.
2. Would you be interested in sharing arrangements with your Czech neighbors, friends, and the community?
If so, what kind of species?
Please send a page with a visa or a stamp (red with a date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian assistance.
Mrs. Libuche, did you pay for the crèche?
Because I can't understand.
You're doing us so much good...
We owe you a great debt... thank you!
Yeah, I know that's very good.
I'll send you a picture of the lady's visit I'm teaching English.
Well, you'll write tomorrow, meet or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We've got enough. It'd be nice to know a man from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Don't you want to meet me after 4:00?
What are your general impressions from the first week
Karina brought us the medicine the other day, and we drink it.
I can work with lying sick and invalid children.
But you have to specify that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.
Can I get you a nice little appetizer?
Because it's only anti-bacterial gel.
I'm not sure, or I'm not much in town... about half a dozen.
What services/activities do you think are needed/unavailable for older people?
I don't know because there was no text from the bank and I didn't take the bank cards, and the kids took the bank attachment and they made me very sad.
Then text me if you want to go.
Today we have the joy - our city of Butch was freed from the occupiers, and our armies prospered.
They're looking for Russians in basements and apartments.
The whole city is replaced, the work of changing will begin.
And John would see if there was something that needed repair or something else.
Diane, as you wish, maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Panas wants to stay home, says he's tired of us, and he wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We'll do the mazanese and do the homework.
These are small businesses that have opened volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
These are tractors, who are actually going to the field under fire, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree to go into humconvoys today to temporarily occupied areas in order to get help and get people out of there.
These are heroic leaders who, fearlessly, go into the battle zone, calm and help refugees in the wagons, and at peaceful stations, help volunteers to load a humanitarian in the wagons.
These are the gas stations that stood on the Gitomir Road in the early days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous.
They are communicators who carry garbage under fire, repair pipes, and power lines to provide the people with the necessary supplies.
They are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining, and at the free moment they are still volunteering to collect medical kits on the front.
We're in Ukraine, we're running out of juice when we have little leaves.
Please tell me, little kids-- what age do you mean?
My daughter's eight years old, is that an acceptable age?
I'm looking for a home for my daughter and me for three or four days every day to come to the Czech Republic and hand over passports for a visa to Canada.
There's a lot of people in Warsaw in the Visa Center and there's no on-line queue.
I wanted to come one day, but it's far, it takes a long time on the train, and it's gonna be hard for the kid.
So I decided to look for a home in or near Prague.
No, we're fine.
Yesterday's Hardware
But I can't change the password when I go through a link, because I get the following mistake:
It's in the microwave room, there's something burning up.
In Ukraine, the operators of the largest banks are always in contact with customers 24 hours a day and all questions are resolved quickly :)
It's okay. I'll get used to new realities.
I don't like it, and I want you to know that.
You can edit the report, the most important thing is that it's true.
Yeah, TV's full of it.
We've already arranged for the fridges. Some Czech boys have responded at 1:00 p.m.
I want to go to you, give you a strong hug, and kiss you.
At 7:30, I'm reading the history of the world theater to actors, directors and theatricians.
Evening, I appreciate the objects. After dinner
Grisko's still asleep, crying at night, licking his teeth.
I'm on the phone right now with everyone I know from Lviv, and a lot of people are dead.
The Czech Republic began issuing visas after March 22, according to me.
By that time, they'd put stamps like this, and then they'd like to match these stamps to a visceral.
Ukraine's Overseas Election District (Ukrainian PLO) is an electoral district that unites electoral sites outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting rooms at Ukrainian embassies and consulates and military bases abroad, [vinoca 1] where the Ukrainian peacekeeping forces (Cosovo and DDR Congo) are present.[1] The District Election Commission for the Concord Election District is the Central Election Commission.
In the foreign electoral district, there are only popular ballots: the election of the President and the people's deputies, and the referendums of the country.
Local elections are not held.
They're at the station near the mother and child's room.
Says he doesn't know where they're going anymore.
Are you mad at me?
I'm going to take a picture of you in the bathing suit.
I don't need any more money. I borrowed a long term from a friend.
I wanted to say that I've already connected the Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device to do that, so I went to O2 and they made me an electronic SIM card, which I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
I'm very uncomfortable, Sunday works and I can't.
You said you had a wrecked washing machine, take it for yourself, you need it too.
We don't have enough carpets, swollen carpets, plates. Kids don't have pyjamas and nothing to move into.
Good morning, I'll be leaving at 10:00... write the address again, there's a missing text.
I don't want to torture you or myself, I'm going to get hurt.
So that would be good, but I know there were no free places, and in principle, they have all the lessons right now, and they're pretty good at teaching.
Do you have a meat cutter to make the stuff?
Let it be after the big day.
Yesterday, did your mom say something hurt you?
She can't tell them what she wants, and she doesn't understand what they're saying.
I went to school today too.
I saw Christina’s mother today, but she didn’t even say hello.
Very tasty apples, what kind of class is that?
The head of the Office of President Andreas Jermack informed us that Russia is starting a "feasibility operation" on the weapons that the allies are handing over to us.
The direct language of Jermak is, "They understand that they're losing war, they're seeing their backwardness, and they want to beat up the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last faucets is the total destruction of the U.S.S.S.S.S. 300.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
We know Russian scripts, one of them.
They can launch fakes that the Ukrainian soldiers of Burkimto seem to have weapons from the allies, and it is massively moving towards arming the Russian army.
I'd like to warn you about those fags.
For the weapons in the hands of the U.S.S. soldiers are exclusively sending the enemy to that world.
Would you excuse me if I forgot to ask you how much it cost to have a garden in the month, and would it work in the summer?
Everyone is given the strength.
There's a lot more darker stories, believe me.
So I needed to survive to change.
In the Torah it is written, and God created a bad beginning in man to make it change spiritually, to become better in the course of life.
It's your home, you can invite anyone you want.
How do we find this lady in social security tomorrow before we go to the hospital we wanted to visit the city hall?
He listened to his mother and didn't come with us.
I know you've had a hard time.
And I'll make you happy.
After what you wrote to me today, I'm happy.
I hope you meant that seriously.
I'm watching the announcement a lot of time already. Now it's hard for us to do this.
I'm sorry, I didn't get the whole point.
Didn't you get a call today about changing the mobile operator's rate?
I'm sorry, but I can't count on anyone in this life.
Today I was offered a day - to - day job.
I'm sorry, but I agreed to work there already.
Thank you for responding and wishing you a good help.
Perhaps your father told us that there are Jehovah’s witnesses among us, but I do not profess any religion.
However, she was baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all religions based on love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, began reading the Torah.
I believe that there are no mediators between man and God.
You can also think about not putting the fridge at the door of the boys’ room.
Thank you very much. You really helped me.
We're looking for a subjunct janitor to clean up the house here in the village.
Offer 150 kroner/year, other cooperation with them.
I'm afraid of chemical care.
I'm just worried about you and me talking to you.
But we can just look at each other.
I was going to my mom's alone, and there was a sister and a friend who was going to go, and Anastasia asked to go with them.
Where's the good barber?
Good afternoon Victor approved this house only doesn't know how to help this gentleman with the documents to get the pay from the airship and said that with the bank furniture is not there yet in the availability of furniture
Thank you very much for your hospitality in your sister-in-law.
We've got good doctors here, too... bye.
We've already cooked food at home, and from the top, we can't find the keys.
I'll take the underwear for the fifth guest, and the pillow and the extra pillow are in the apartment?
So, as we get in touch with the owners, there's no contact, I need a long-term dwelling, we're working and we can pay, help if you can.
At the end of every description, you have contact with the owner.
You can use this online translation from Ukrainian to Ukrainian and vice versa for communication.
Whatever, I'm four on one bed in a room where you can't even afford it, thank you very much.
Well, did you click the links I sent you above?
On each of them you have a free offer of housing, a description, a contact with the owner, and a photo.
I can't find contact without an e-mail, if I'm sorry, which is closer to the Czech Krumlov, we have a job in the Czech Krumlov, and now we live in Prague.
Then I won't help you, Brna doesn't have a chance.
Thank you for helping us out, but we need a bed and a couch, and maybe you can tell us where to buy, not expensive, because the budget is weak, thank you very much.

We cleaned the whole room and moved to the other room.
The international community continues to express shock and resentment after evidence has emerged that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as “provocation.”
“The report of the murdered, raped and severely wounded by Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians is worth the conviction”, said New Zealand's prime minister, Jasinda Adern, to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer to the world for what they did,” she added, noting that its government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its struggle against Russian invasion.
The Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kissida, called the incidents a “violation of international law”.
The allegations were made following reports that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the outskirts of Kiev, in Butchi, by Russian troops who had left the area after occupation for several weeks.
Photographs depicting the bodies of civilians killed with tied hands shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced to the radio interview on April 4, that there were signs that Russian troops had committed “war crimes” in Butch.
“What happened in Butch requires a new round of sanctions and very clear steps,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian export of coal and oil.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez, stated that Russian troops could go so far that they had committed a “genocide” in Butch.
“We will make sure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” said Sánchez in Madrid.
In her performance on public television late on April 3, Russia’s MSS spokesman, Maria Zacharova, dismissed the charge as “provocation.”
She stated without evidence that the United States and NATO had “committed” images to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minute after the material appeared does not raise any doubts as to who ordered the story,” said Zacharova.
Formerly, the Russian Ministry of Defence also stated without evidence that the Butchi image was “a further order of the Kiyiv regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called the “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Butch.
On April 4, Russia’s follow-up committee published a statement in which it announced the “investigation” of the charges of “knownly false information” about Russian military operations in Butch.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of “genocide” in the city, and told the Kremlin’s leaders that they should come to Butchie to see what their soldiers had done.
“I want all leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being implemented,” said Zelenski in videotape, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting at the police," he said.
He stated that Russian President Volodymyr Putin and Russian military personnel should be responsible for the actions of the army in Ukraine.
“When we find people with hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand,” he said about scenes of victims scattered in the streets of Butchi, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a reporter from the Ukrainian Service, Radio Liberty, saw a small city on the streets as if it were civilians.
In one place alone, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists have seen at least 21 bodies in various places in Butchi.
The bodies of one group of nine -- all in civilian -- were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to the locals, was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims seem to have been killed from a nearby distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities claimed that the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in the area of Kiev, which had been controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, it's all there, we bought it from the list.
"They were told, "Kyeva is gone."
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by horrendous things, such as looting, rape, murder, and torture.
There is another point in this list that is now much less known – the removal of the local population to the enemy’s territory.
About the middle of March, Russian occupiers “evacuate” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied localities into their territory and within the area of Belarus, which President Lukashenko himself actually gave to the Russian military police.
"Ukrainian Truth" found the expelled Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text have been forced to evacuate voluntarily outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from despair.
Fortunately, they're alive and maintaining contact with their family.
However, in view of the claims made by Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So in Melitopol, the Russians stole the staff of the second nursing home, took the children out of there without their parents, including the 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the dead Ukrainian champion of Joseph Zacepsky's swim.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valie moved to Guestomel a few months before the war.
Alexander was the one who received work at Antonov Airport, which is two and a half kilometers from the village.
The family settled in a military town, although it was a civilian.
As true plumbers, Denis and Marina gathered their alarmed suitcases early in the morning, but they couldn't get to evacuate on the 24th of February.
They did not have their own car, and the suburban buses no longer took anyone.
About 12:00 p.m. on the 24th of February, they saw helicopters with a Latin letter V, followed by the first rockets.
One of them got into a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 persons were hidden in their cellar.
Not all of them decided.
"On the 6th evening of February 24th, people came into the driveway who spoke not Russian and not Ukrainian.
They say, "Is there anyone?" I say, "Get out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were questioned if they were serving in the army.
The women were told, "We've come to defend you on Ramzan Kadir's instructions."
It was the Chechen OMON, not even the army, the young boys of 25-35 years old.
They said, "We've been helped by the Ukrainians in the war, Sasha White, "and now we've come to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what was missing.
We say that the water, it was a big problem.
They broke the store, took the goods out of there under "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us six bouts.
There are also videos on the Internet where children thank Kadir for food.
So they're the ones who, after the shop was robbed, brought the cowboy and said, "We know it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatovich."
No one especially wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid says, "You have seven days to hand over our phones," they laughed.
They also regularly separate themselves from the Russians.
They said, "It's a good thing they came because they didn't want war, because the Ukrainians are backed up, and they're all good, "Putin is an asshole, Kadir too, but there's nothing we can do, because our families are there."
And mostly, they didn't fight, they went robbing shops, they were looting.
They put the chickens on their own, tied one to one leg with a georgian tape, and the other with their white scotch, and they called it "militia."
They arrived in Ukraine unprepared.
I don't know how their intel worked... when they were beaten in Butch, so they didn't even take the dead, they asked us, "Do you have artillery?"
More than that, we had misguided rods — the Chechens did not know each other; in the early days, they asked for passwords to find out whether they were of a foreigner or not.
We had them by March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk trooper.
They put 30-40 units of technology between the houses -- ours were always in it from the Bayractars.
But these came and told us that the VMS is gone, but there's "Azov," and they say, "Azova" is like 100 thousand in Ukraine.
Called "Kiev has already given up" and it's been going on since early March.
One day a Russian came to us — either an officer of the Desant or a representative of the FSB — and said that there would be evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- it was about Butch, Gostomel, and we thought maybe we had a green corridor.
From the beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
And they said, "Well, you have to regret the mentality of your children!"
How it worked, they put us in the basement and started shooting from under the house -- or the Grades or the Minomets.
And then it came back... the houses in the neighborhood just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a straight touch on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to pass on to the border and the Red Cross.
Part of it didn't go, saying it was for traitors of their homeland, saying, "You're shot up there, you're sold to organs."
We were taken through the Chernobylbyl, and the roads were on both sides of the road, and the equipment was broken down, although the whiteros told us that the Russians were moving to them immediately.
A lot of caponirs, buried technology, and soldiers.
At the white-romanian entrance to the mosquito, we went through improvised control, many people were without any documents because they burned down.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, and we were given tea.
And here we hear the shots! There's a rocket fired, and it's obvious that Iskander was working on Kiev.
Although they from the Belorussian Red Cross said, "No, these planes fly, they turn on the border."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we know what it is.
Then we were loaded on a bus and taken to the Chonkie sanatorium near Gomel.
His headman, Wenger Vasil Stepanovich, came and said, "Here I am the forelock, I am from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenk will not stop until these thieves of yours have been slaughtered.
Poor people are suffering!
And we've got Lukashenko so good!
Whatever he says, it will be."
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration said to us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN representation (at least they were called) spread misinformation that men in Poland could not travel.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents — our daughter had no foreign passport.
We were supposed to get it on Monday, and the war broke out on Thursday.
At the Ukrainian consulate, we received no help, and at the station in Minska, we were told that no one would get on the bus without passports.
Let me tell you something about the help of the Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsko, and we were accompanied.
In the sanatorium, they didn't have any power.
Our second group of migrating representatives said you could live here for a maximum of a week, because Belarus is not Europe, there's no payment.
We found an internal transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled near Mosir (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – U.S.), we saw ballistic missile launches in Ukraine: the rocket first flew out, the rocket lighted up beautifully, and then the missile went off.
People who boarded a bus in Moziri told us that Russians were constantly shooting from polygons.
But I can say that white men don't want to fight.
Generals are being released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was invited.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, is not believed at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
It is not accepted that their polygons are used to target Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we're registering, deciding what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are probably as much now as Estonian flags."
Marina lived in a military town in Gostomel with the family of her brother, his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nieces and asked them to collect the most basic items and documents.
In the evening, they went to sleep in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself could not return home, and in principle she could not — the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you go downtown on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. We're always waiting for you.
Thank you for the deal, the towels are beautiful.
And in this little apartment, there's no wi-fi, mostly on all your questions, and now I don't know what to do, and the kids on Monday's online, and the Internet isn't there.
So I'm going to live with two Ukrainian women and their children, or is this a family that's ready to accept us?
The Koran says: “Even a leaf from a tree falls from its known form. ”
The kids are learning online, I'm a salesman and a cook, but I can work both in the field and the cleaning lady, which is a different maryan specialist in war-building. She can work at home, and Marian's friend has no specialty, that's different.
Can we agree on how best to do this?
On April 1, the city’s head of Butchi, Anatoly Fedorook, delivered a joyful message that the Ukrainian military released the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would have felt at that time was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it was known at the same time that at least 280 civilians had been shot by the Russians alone.
They were killed on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back, some of the dead were minors.
Killed and tortured, the village chief of Motizin Olgu Suchenko, her husband Igor, and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23th, were found.
Olga and Alexander were in a brotherly grave, and Igor in a sewer.
The two sides of the trail 20 km from Kiev found the bodies of several stripped women wrapped in a carpet.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there'll be no one at home.
I ordered a package from Germany using DHL.
Last night, I had to deliver it, but no one was in contact with me and the message was not delivered, and on DHL, it was said that the recipient could not be found.
So the mail was sent to the mail and the address of this section was given.
How can I take it?
I too, when I was young every day a few times, could be on the river, a river just next to the house, but now I'm very rarely walking, no time, and sometimes a desire, only from my sister.

President Volodymyr of Zelenski stated that certain types of weaponry provided by Western partners had come too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, published by the Office of the President, writing "European Truth."
"All the equipment, all they're sending, for some kinds of equipment, it's done late.
So what, when we're talking, for example, about Mariupol, when you're losing thousands of people, and now what?
I see 100 percent support from leaders in some countries, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Zelensky.
On the question of whether it was enough weaponry for Ukraine to make a difference in the war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would be no war, or it would have looked different.
"It would be different, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be a war,' he added.
We recall that the British Prime Minister promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armoured personnel carriers and anti-ship weapons.

I didn't even touch the door, and she called.
If I understood Mr. Director correctly, he said that if I worked in the garden, I could come to work some day for as many hours as I could get.
If that's the case, I'll be able to, for example, work a few days a week for a few hours.
For how many hours and days I'm going to watch out of my house, so I'm fashioned and cleaning apartments, there's more money for cleaning, so I don't want to give up that job either.

He was a very rich man, but he liked me because I had a life view. I met him, and then I left him.
He was a rich man, and after a while he called and told him that he had had heart surgery.
He asked me to just sleep with him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man, and he thought that maybe I was his toy, and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"The car was standing in my backyard, like a crocodile, and she opened her paths.

I understand I can't sit in you. I have to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or even Ukrainian television.

The British who defended Mariupol in the U.S.S.A. says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The British, who is a military officer of the Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who is involved in the defence of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would build weapons and surrender to Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aydin Aislin, a British who served in the U.S.S. lava since 2018, Air Force citing Ayslin's family and friends, Atlas News citing the words of a friend of Ayslin, who spoke to him
Twitter Aislin said, "We received a message from him, "It took 48 days, we tried everything we could to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian forces.
We don't have any food or ammunition left.
Thank you, everyone, I hope the war will soon end."
Details: Aislin served in the 36th separate U.S. Marine Brigade, which is involved in the defence operation of Mariupol.
Air Force reporters contacted En Wood's mother, and she confirmed that her son had announced on the phone that they were planning to surrender to captivity.
The second military officer, Brennan Philips, also confirmed to the journalists that in the last telephone conversation Icelyn spoke about the plans of their subdivision from the capitulation.
According to him, the crew ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of Atlas News have contacted a friend of his who said that Aislin's unit is about to surrender to Russian subdivisions so that it does not get caught without weapons and bullets in the hands of the so-called “cadiers”.
The social media also used audio recordings of a telephone conversation where Acelyn seemed to be talking to a friend who knew the American who was planning to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Acelyn said that they tried to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Before, the British told him that he was threatened at Instagram by representatives of a private military company called Wagner.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark on Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight against the terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he formally joined the ZSU lava and sworn in.
Aislin's friends and loved ones called Johnny, and in social media, he's more famous under the name Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know if we're together or not.
But it won't be easy, you'll have to find him...
You asked me to come with you, I agreed if everything was okay.

One brother in the wars in Mariupol, the other in Zaporizha, and today a man from Kiev was transferred to Harkow.
They call every day, they say everything's okay, and there's someone who knows him, they won't tell the truth.
I wanted to see you, but I wanted to do some work.
I'll ask the man in the morning if he can make it tomorrow.
When you come home, write me, please, I would need to talk to Daniel.
The big-time attackers for their losses were playing full-on in the fight.
Teacher Dmitr Pawlitsky, an unknown relative, was shot at by a young man named Boris Oleksianka.
Their bodies have been thrown into “a deep pit that has been buried in the ground”.
Behind the memory, “there was some dead silence in the city.”
Slightly, one of the residents ran from house to house.
On the streets, the bodies of the Bolsheviks were always seen.
And I might actually follow you, I need you, I can't without you.
3. What kind of activity/activity would help you or your friends better adjust to life in the Czech Republic?
But you're not going to, because the railroad is being rebuilt and the stop is closed.

I want to be able to repay all those who helped us, for this was the last hope, indeed.
I am not afraid of work, as I lived in the countryside, so I can and I like to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition, we do this at Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved Law Propaganda 7176, which is called "To make possible the monitoring of potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economy".
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics has turned out to be... the place where the members of the supervisory board of holding companies and holdings sit down.
Initiators believe that the decision - making by the supervisory board of the custodian in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve Ukraine’s national security problems.
We are aware of the large number of new threats to the host companies, but we are not yet aware of any company that has become required to physically sit on the desk at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is an excellent basis for “removing” all the gains in the difficult post-revolution bondage reform, including independent oversight of the board, and then setting up manual controls.
It's like it was before 2015.
Why should companies keep watch over the board, and who should join them?
More importantly, if one harmful law-promoting object flies under patriotic slogans, others can fly tomorrow – for example, the government procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NPA can be shattered.
A lot of things can be written off for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the legal object 7176.
So on February 22, this rule was added to the comparative table of subject 5397.
In general, the desire to disengage the board in one way or another has been circulating among some of the people’s chosen ones for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but for the purpose of showing the possible consequences of a law - provoking object, let us consider the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then I'll give you my suggestions on how to deal with the issue of the management of the chain of command during the war.
The first deputy of the minister of the economy, Denise Cudin, explained the need for such innovation with the risks of losing the Internet and other communication tools, which would prevent remote oversight boards from doing so.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which could cause the company's work to be paralyzed.
We agree that such a risk is, but can he prevent the transfer of members of the Watch Tower Board to Ukraine?
Imagine a cynical situation in which independent members of the supervisory board (which constitute the majority of the entire body) would put their personal security above the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case, according to the law, they could be released.
And then, more likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum, the necessary oversight joy to make any decisions.
On the other hand, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for a competitive selection that lasts an average of 3 to 4 months.
Hence, the 7176 law - provoking decision is more likely than anything to prevent the oversight board from losing the ability to make decisions, but instead it will lead to it!
The People’s Deputies, author of Dmitro Natallah’s law-promoting body, provides other arguments for his support.
In particular, he notes that “many businesses, such as the Defence and Industrial Complex (PPC), are now in need of repositioning” and that “it is hard to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna on Zoom discuss addresses and other sensational information.”
For starters, there is hardly any PKK in Ukraine that has oversight of the board.
The Supervisory Board is only in the Ucropronprom, which essentially manages almost all of the PKK's activities.
But even in Ucroboronprom, according to the law, the board of oversight has quite limited powers, and all its members carry out duties that are not free of charge.
The full power of Ucrobororrome is vested in the Director General, who will, by the way, make decisions as to the need to relocate a PKK enterprise that is part of the firm.
Moreover, such an argument does not stand out for criticism, either, because 7176 does not make any changes to the law governing the operation of the PKK ducts.
Mr. Dmitro also cites arguments on his Facebook page that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments tend to have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of the operations of the host companies and the banks, but let's try to figure out some of them: "respectful foreign experts at the first word "war," leaving Ukraine in 2021, but remain members of the supervisory board in Ukrainian state enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand currency, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from war."
First of all, it's a manipulation -- most of these board members never lived in Ukraine, and they just came here from time to time.
So it's not fair to say they're leaving Ukraine.
Second, as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian board members have long been engaged in online sessions.
This tool has long been common in world practice, with very different fields: business, education, medicine, and so on.
It is also worth remembering that membership in a watchdog is not a full-time job.
Typically, these people have other things to do, and that's what electronics help them to do.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not express identical claims to members of the supervisory board who are Ukrainians?
Because they're not behind their company's location either.
To say the word, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from the oversight board, and war is only a new opportunity.

We usually need an adult's passport.
In the Bróvarsk, Vishgorod, and Buchanan regions of Kyiv, which have been freed from the occupation, the two - day commanding hour will be introduced.
The direct language of Pavluk: "In the towns of Brovarsky, Vishgorod, and Buchanan, which were under Russian occupation and freed by the Ukrainian Defence Forces, the commanding hour has been strengthened!
In the area of these cities and villages, restrictions will be in effect from 9:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the raid, it is strictly forbidden at this time to stay on the streets of population centres and other public places, to travel and to walk.
Residents can only enter the street during an alarm signal to get into hiding.
Such restrictions are imposed to eliminate the effects of Russian aggression — to clean up and displace areas.
The Omeljanyak called on people who had left these areas for the time being to refrain from returning home.
At the end of Kiev, the commanding hour will last from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day.

After a full - scale aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the Western countries took the prediction of a possible contagion in the Balkans seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

Lucaschenka’s regime has held three whiterows for 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of two relay booths of a signal set under the Osipovich, which provides for the movement of railway trains.
Source: Swaboda Joy, Vyasna Law Defense Center, Head of the MAF Criminal Police, Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by Belta.
In the MIF of Belarus, it was reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobrouisk were detained for force support by SOD.
According to the "Embark" report, when detained, the men were actively resisting and trying to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical institution.
Others were provided with on-site medical care.
The head of the Crime Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus, Gennady Kazakevich, stated that “the acts of terrorism on the RB railway would be severely stopped” by the armed forces.
On April 6, it was reported that on March 30, the police detained another Belarusian railway colleague, a fellow Baranovichisky section of the BDZ, and an administrator of the BDZ topical resources in Vkontakte and Valentine Samasyuk's "Seniors".
Where he is now and where he is unknown, @belzhd_live reports.
By the end of March, at least 40 railways were delayed for sabotage in Belarus.
Let's remind you, the formation of the BYpol, which was declared by the Lukashenka regime to be extremist, continues to call on the whiterows to sabotage railway and Belarus infrastructure in the Peramoga plan.
The Belarusian "race guerrillas" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As we know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is hurling a living force and technology into Ukraine to fight.

The US bans investments in the Russian Federation and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters.
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, has introduced new sanctions against the daughters of the Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation, the Alpha Bank, and the Sierra Bank, and has banned all new investments in Russia.
This is reported on the White House website.
Silverbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, which is owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets that apply to the US financial system and ban US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
For this purpose, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on a decision by more than 600 multinational companies to leave Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as legal and consulting companies,” is in White House’s declaration.
The third step in the new US sanctions has been restrictions on large Russian state enterprises in the critical field.
This would ban U.S. citizens from dealing with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
A detailed list of Minfin will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the total blocking of the assets of the adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the Foreign Minister of Lavrov, as well as the members of the Security Council of Russia, including the Ex-President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Mishustin.
Sanctions disable them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they own in the United States.
You can only get to this place, the rest of the drive is closed, and I'll come to you.
Vira, can we wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war, I worked as a flight attendant for SkyAp, my mother was an industrial sewer, my son-in-law Makarczyk went to the garden.
We lived beautifully, but we did not even think that we would be forced to flee because we were no longer able to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we have the hope that someone will take us home for the first time) We can even pay for a room or a flat, but if it's in our pocket.
Cleanness and order are guaranteed.
We have no harmful habits.
We should be grateful for such help at such a time.
After lunch, I had a lecture in English and then went to work in the children’s room.
There I explained to Margariti how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands and does everything well.
I also met Mrs. Lena and she and I talked about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.
It's a free swim.
You can call the school, Kira doesn't take the phone, doesn't answer, I don't know if she's in school.
They isolate the Russian office: stop investments and stop supplies.
However, we did not understand.

Everything's fine.
How often do you clean up?
I clean up every week.
I'm sorry I don't have a program, but I'll try and figure it out.
I Dreamed to Be a Teacher
My girls can't move anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you if you'd listen to information for the house, you'd let me know.
I'd love to rent a place with a decent girl.
If you can know that, let me know.
On my side, I won't let you down.
Thank you early.
Hasn't written you another person, Natal, 54 years old. Please write an exact address and how much the course costs.
I think you better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.

We're going to a medical commission now.
I mean, we're gonna have to work this hour on another day.
On what day would she be better off to come early?
I'll hear you tomorrow, the Internet's not working well.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thank you... we found something out of the stuff, but there was nothing out of the technique...
Both beginners, except the abbreviation, are not aware of anything
Nothing's going on.
Can we do it on Monday, 25.04?
Kids can be taken with them, toys enough here:)
I figured out about my dad.
I may be very naive or very in love, but I will come up with this money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how this will be paid, please, no loans.
Text me straight and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Should we take those clothes with us?
It's not my day. The blinds in the living room broke. One morning.
Something came from you, I can't see
I'm very sad too.
I'll remind you of the facture later.
Is it just your dad who talks and understands Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to clean a house, and how many windows does a house have?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you.
Raju to read Joe Dispense, he's doing scientific research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections.
Natalia Nagorna, a 1+1 television reporter, released a video on April 12th morning, which was handed over to her by the 36th Marine Military Brigade from Mariupol.
It is said by the military that there were no weapons left in them to fight, and a mountain of wounded people.
They said, "the count goes for an hour."
Prior to that, April 11, 36th, a separate Marine Brigade involved in the defence of Mariupol published an address to the Ukrainians in Russian.
It was said that April 11 could be the last fight for Mariupol's protectors, and the Ukrainian military command had not been linked to the fighters for two weeks.
In the social media, scepticism was expressed that the application was published in Russian.
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valerius Valera Valera, has assured us that the command of the defence forces in Mariupol is connected, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal factory in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to the leader of Azova, Andrey Biletski, the Russian army has used chemical weapons over the Azovstal factory, which is holding the fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I'll fix it for you.
The situation is the same as we're still here.
Two hours of driving ) walks, Mom shopping and back!
It's not important to the right.
She forgot what she was gonna do here.
The Chechen drone squadron has now begun flying over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional coppers will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Zakarpatian and two Czech brothers sent “birds” to Ukraine the day before yesterday, thanks to MP Mukachev of the town of Volodymyr Lubutenka.
Today, for their inter-Girl friends led by the village council leader and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Wasil Schur delivered drones for assignment: they were given special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting is ongoing.
For the most efficient and safe use of coppers, where they are located, we'll leave them in secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what they have done, say that in the nearest days, many more interesting gifts will be sent to Ukraine to serve the destruction of the Russian occupier and the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, it's okay, I love sweet, but I can do it without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine soon, and I'm going to keep working.
If it's okay, I'll take it.
I'll try to do it myself, but if there's a splash, I'll text you, if I may?
The main thing is that we understand each other.
We were personally in the lady of old age in the village of Eve, she saw me and that I was pregnant, but she said there was no housing.
Maybe she'll be happy and get her mood up.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm still cold on the street today.
I've had medicine and tea, and I feel worse, but I'm not critical.
I'm also sorry, but I'd rather meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, send me the music you like.
I'm interested in what you've got to do with music.
Mom and Dad Should Be Obeyed
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
It's been colder and rainier today.
But it's not a pity the houses have been destroyed, the people who are being bullied by the occupiers.
In Herson, the occupiers were harassed by the Memorial of Glory of Ukraine in Herson on Perekopsky Street.
Details: It is noted that unknowns have torn the flag of the European Union, shredded panels with photographs of the Celestial Hundred and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The occupiers tore down portraits of the heroes of the Celestial Hundred and the dead in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The flag's down.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for the cart, we don't have that custom, so we didn't know, we gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe there was something else we needed to give.
There's someone in Czech to talk to.
'Cause I'm kind of living in a group home. Up to twelve people will be here, and then they'll go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I was in the crèche today.
Even today, I've been sleeping there.
So we are making great progress.
I'm sure I'll bring the cookies another time!
I don't have the strength to make them today.
Since I'm being pushed away from the days and times of cleaning after the guests, I can say something about April of the month because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning the apartments.
For the month of May, I can say about it at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
I just asked if you were talking about it.
Hey, I'm sorry I didn't make dinner and I slept a little.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
Or we'll meet after you've arrived.
He's a humble, recent student, and he's got a lot to learn.
Hello) Everything went very well.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people in such a high position.
Today I learned a lesson from a lady who is the director of the Economics Department of the Highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grisko in the crèche was doing well.
On Monday, I have to bring you a job confirmation and a cash payment for the crèche.
I'm on my way to Friday.
I don't do anything but do a lot of them and sleep.
If he goes to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you, if I may.
I have to deliver another analysis.
I don't have to go again.
It's not working well, it's washing, it's not working well, it's needing a master, it's got to be fixed.
That's enough.
Can you send me the correct e-mail address?
I'd like to send you an invitation to a course in Czech for which you have signed up.
And the children are fed there, or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment, there's one question.
If you need another help, write
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating Easter tonight, right?
From the beginning, we didn't really want you to raise money, so people didn't think we were burning it!
But I didn't have two points to fill out online:
I'm going to go to bed, get some energy and energy, and thank you for the present.
I'm going to watch the video, it's going to be good because the whole family is going to paint.
The University of Carazin urges workers and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in mesengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in the Ukraine is also helping the army.
I got a few jobs for the portfolio.
After the holidays, we're supposed to have an Internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I'm going to get the day I wasn't at work is a pass
Headquarters summary: Russia prepares a provocation in Transdinaster to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transdinastrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against the neighbouring state”.
It is true that “the armed forces of the Russian Federation are not excluded from provocation activities in the territory of the Predinastrian Region of the Republic of Moldova with a view to accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring State.”
Details: The adversary continues to create an offensive group of troops to operate in the Slothian direction.
In the nearest days, the occupiers are likely to try to regain the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and dispatch a special unit, weapons, and equipment to participate in combat activities in Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being prepared at the location of the 60th single-stroke brigade (Monastery) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military Region.
It is likely that the weapons will be transferred to the temporarily occupied area of the Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the loss of the special subdivisions of the Battalion tactical group of the 36th separate MV brigade (Borgia, Zabaykalsk province), the 29 General Army of the Eastern Military Region is recruiting military officers from the designated brigade.
The enemy has a particular problem in putting together drivers and driver mechanics.
The selection of the selected unit from the permanent position is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the adversary, to disrupt the supply of trucks to battlefields, will continue to strike the transport infrastructure in Ukraine for the purpose of destroying or derailing them.
The designated subdivisions of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to enhance the protection of the Ukrainian-Bellow border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Slohotian side, separate subdivisions of the 6th General Army and the North Coast Army continue to block part of the city of Harkov, and continue to fire artillery shells in separate areas of the city.
On the Isooskaya direction, aerial reconnaissance is ongoing with the aim of detecting positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
That's what the adversary uses for the Orlan 10 drone.
The enemy tried to strike in the direction of the towns of Longenke and Dimitrovka with the strength of two Battalion tactical groups, without success, and went back to positions previously occupied.
In the Donetsk direction, the opponent continues to focus on taking control of the localities of Popasna, Rubizna, Lower, and Novobakhmutka, as well as placing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to launch an attack in the Golden Area, and it was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, the occupiers continue to storm the Azovstal plant and the seaport with artillery and aviation.
The forces of separate subdivisions fired artillery shells at Ukrainian military positions in the areas of Visokopilla, Trubojlovka and Marijansk.
In Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts, Ukraine's protectors have over the past few years captured four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight units of armoured vehicles, six units of vehicle technology, and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Don't you understand what you're thinking?
We'll usually try to make it, but I doubt it.
How can you sleep and I'll hold you up?
You sure you don't mind me coming over?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I'll understand.
We didn't watch TV at home, and we don't have to set it up.
I'm going to turn on the TV just to listen to the language of the Czech.
I'm running out of a month's tariff today :)
Can we do that on the phone today?
Buy weaving tissue, canvas, sewing threads
I understand that I can prepare the material in this field.
I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us so much pie.
I'll meet my father later, I'll be sure to.
I've read the facebook statement, so Google must have written something from his own.
Good afternoon, we're the things you brought, but there are things that we're small can bring you in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about the job.
If Mr. Director does, I can start starting work next week because I'm planning to go to the office tomorrow afternoon to get the papers (if you get very big queues) and on Saturday rain:
I'm looking for a team at the beginning, and I really liked chemistry at school, learning Czech to know perfectly, dreaming of working in Teva.
Friends are old and not very good, friends I don't know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you too are faced with difficult times.
During the last month, I was in touch with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from foot to head, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have confessed to being guilty and ashamed by your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because they're giving up Ukraine in your name.
Some of you activists have long been under threat, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
Early in March, I wrote Alexander Čerkasov, a very old friend of Memorial.
Let’s talk later, ” as Sasha usually said, briefly. “ Now, after we have searched, we walk through the ruins.
Others — artists, artists, critics, writers — are impressed by the sudden collapse of your tiny world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of a very few of you -- those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Newspaper, in the Echo of Moscow, in the Medusa, in the Naval and in a few other places -- have many of you done anything to oppose this regime?
Except for participating in the rally when it was still taking place.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to keep quiet"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is more than an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive association, which may now be a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
That was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had to a certain extent a freedom and democracy – a messy, even a bloodthirsty, but real one.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why, every time you finally have a revolution, do you finally have such a deep fear of grief that you seek salvation behind the king's back, may his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel safer around him.
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of grabbing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans in the stamp did, you took your soul to the monument of Dzerzynsky – and allowed the KGB to lay low, refresh, reform, and take control of the country.
When you were asked to choose between the looting of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option — and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival was the main concern.
Then Putin appeared, young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you have bought it, but either you have voted for it or have preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya with the land again, most of you were blindfolded.
I remember well those years.
I worked in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of the Putinian "antiteroristic operation," and with my eyes I saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed: the torture of peaceful people, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You said to me, "We're sick of your Chechnya." I remember that very well.
In response, I resented, "Friends, this isn't my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your fucking country, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your authority that bombes one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic upturn in the middle of zero, caused by the rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made good money, some have been rich, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found a better job.
The price's up, but what's wrong?
Moscow shining and barking from the neck.
When several opponents were killed – Yuri Kikkochikin, Anna Politkovska, Alexander Litwinenka, and others – many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, there was no further matter.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President Medvedev and sat down as Prime Minister, I see you're barely paying attention to it.
When Medvedev Russia invaded Georgia after several months of government, most of you ignored or silenced it.
How many of you did I meet in the next years on the hills of Goodauri, in the front of Casbej, or in the cafeterias and in the Turkish tulips of Tbilisi, while a part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit, I don't think we've done much in the West, if we've done anything at all.
A little resentment, a little sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia’s flagrant violation of international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and domestic market was so great?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the hard 1990s, that was the most important thing.
But at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, did wake up.
When Putin changed places again with Medvedev and sat down the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you were mass protesting.
Navalny's name became pronouncing, you didn't walk out of the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt horrified that it was losing soil under its feet.
He then struck back.
At first, alternative action was organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have received enormous terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The power is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Disturbed by the pro-Russian president, who deceived their European expectations, they once captured Maidan – and never left him again.
They completely built a tent town on their own and prepared themselves for decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovic became the fugitive, and the Ukrainians returned democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and to expel them if they were doing their job badly.
Maydan was very displeased with Putin.
That was a bad example.
So, using the general confusion, he took the Krem.
Some of you were opposed, but the benefits are few.
How many of you have been thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported anecdotes.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you, who despised Putin and his gang, suddenly returned 180 degrees and adored it.
I find it difficult to find a reason because immediately after that, we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you hid yourself in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as new after the restoration, which was started by Moscow in 2012, with their bingoes, the popular vifay and the hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's just getting better.
You've drawn close attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't there?
IDILE or whatever... even the Moscow editor who released my book about Syria criticized it in an interview then, because I had little idea of what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I was driving there, and I myself saw government snipers shooting cold-blooded at my children's peers on the streets of Homs.
Among all Russian citizens there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first, they came through the socialists, but I was silent because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came to the tradesmen, but I was silent because I wasn't a tradesman.
Then they came after the Jews, but I spoke silently because I am not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left to say anything to protect me."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the majority of them said nothing.
Some really say now – such as Dmitro Glukhovsky, Mikhailo Shishkin, Mikhailo Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the interior of the country, like Marina Ovalnikov, risking entering the new GULAS or putting the company into Nawalny.
As far as others are concerned, you are best aware of the country in which you live.
So, I'm sure you understand that when Putin takes care of the Ukrainians – or, which seems very likely, if he doesn't, he'll take care of you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who courageously, but mostly alone, have protested, and have so far been insignificant, but soon will be more serious.
For thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed dissent in social media (even in the black square in Instagram) or who have spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of disfellowshipping were simply for anecdotes have not been in such a distant past – and now they are very likely to wait for you in the future.
Who, then, will speak for you?
The example of the Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that mind, motivation, and courage can stop it, no matter how depressing it may be on the paper of its advantage.
In view of everything, few in Russia are aware of this, as is the fact that war is going on.
But you, my friends, know exactly what's going on.
You read news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you communicate.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be alert.
You know what this is all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence came to an end.
Your choices are just jokes, your laws, if you don't consider the repressive, cost no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media are gone, your economy is destroyed faster than I'm writing, you don't have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there are still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence; he will demand your agreement, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to drive or you can get crushed.
I'm afraid you're seeing another option.
Still, there's another one left.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And maybe under the conditions you're in, you're going to need less than you think.
Think about it.
It's not from you: because of the economic collapse that's taking place in Russia, it's likely to burn in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices go up and wages don't pay, those people who have voted for Putin for all these years, wanting bread and peace, will go out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, or you, my friends.
But if each city goes out to a rally in itself, as it has done on a periodic basis, it will not be difficult for it to stifle them alone.
There will be a need for organization and coordination. The crowd will have to be converted into mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool -- an Internet that can limit the regime, but that still works and that can be set up under almost any circumstances.
Navalny’s organization has been defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized.
There's a lot of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly hundreds of thousands.
If more than 300,000 comes out, it will be stunned.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to it?
After all, what did he force them to do in Ukraine, all that he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will experience a perceived fear; but those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I'd be afraid if I were you, too.
In Syria, and now in Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happened to those who dared to ignore their master, who tried not only to demand freedom but really to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost for nothing.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat game – and he will be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the Internet – and he will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes – and die in a gray cell under police batons.
That's what's been going on for years – and it's only going to get bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know what's gonna happen.
Act in cold blood, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, and they told us we could come on Monday.
We'll be home tonight.
That you see me as a secretary's press
Wow, how often do you go to a fancy restaurant for dinner?
Once on my mouth, I go to dinner at a fancy restaurant.
I'm trying to explain it to her.
So we liked it very nice and we wanted something better because it's a better option.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people.
I don't feel well, coughing, temperature, voice loss, weakness and head spinning.
I have to go to that government of work.
We've already done it, but they said who registered in April half the money only at the end of the month.
On Thursday, we need a break, we'll go with the kids to the doctor.
But at night, I was texting a lady who liked your work, and she would want something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her and I'm sure to let her know.
When I was working in the procurator, I thought I was building a career, and I was spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a shame to lose time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am communicat, but I am serious about love and marriage.
There was a man I had to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I think people have to love, respect, trust each other in order to create a family.
I haven't seen that before.
Good day, where can you get a form in Jewelle to bake a bag (paper or silicoon)?
All right, thanks for the advice, I'm gonna put a statement on Valya.
She's got a DCP in her bed, now she's got a broken foot in her hips, a wheelchair in her bed, all the food is wiping in a blender.
Mr. Reyhardt, I'm sorry I'm bothering you at a bad time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie's playroom today, to say hello to her.
She was in a bad situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby, because she said that she came to look at things and put them in that room with clothes, and Mr. Valery opened up our children's room yesterday until 7:00.
Can that really be the case?
It's working time for the room before 4:00.
