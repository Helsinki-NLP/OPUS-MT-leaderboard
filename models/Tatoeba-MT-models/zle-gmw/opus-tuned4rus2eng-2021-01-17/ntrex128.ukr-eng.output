Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about “associating with the mappets”
Some CAs have been horrified by the recommendation to change their title to “Member of Parliament Wales” (MWP).
This recommendation came from plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Parliament Wales".
WHEN all the political spectrum is concerned, it can make fun of you.
One of the Labourers claimed that his group was worried about Rome with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "unconceived", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
CA from the Welsh Party stated that his group was generally "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said that his group was “inconclusive” about changing the name, but noted that MWP could quickly become a “mappet.”
In this context, the Welsh term "w" is similar to the Yorkshire word "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change names, observed: “The only decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves.”
The Wales Self-Settlement Act of 2017 gives the Wels Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of the public debate, and the renaming of the Assembly to the Welssa Parliament received wide support.
In terms of how to call the CA, the commission proposes to call them “members of the Wels Parliament,” or WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest public support.
Of course, CHA is offering alternatives, but trying to agree can cause problems to head Elien Jones, who is supposed to submit a change bill for a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including rules of exclusion of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
WHEN the law is discussed, there will be a final vote on its new name.
The Macedonians go to a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the polls vote whether to change the name of the country to the North Macedonian Republic.
Voting was organized to resolve a long - term dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is a claim in Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
President George Ivan of Macedonia, who opposes the referendum on change of name, stated that he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that changing the name is simply a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Call Saint-Martin, because Harlem Churches are going through difficult times.
“The old people I've been talking to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
There is no such thing now.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“In modern times, people are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer the local hotel they regularly visit.”
As far as churches are concerned, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expect, and “they will be where they started sooner or later.”
The churches, he added, could replace condominium houses, and there would be people living there who would not help the shrines nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will speed up the day that all these churches will close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolitan: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and Saint-Martin was built ten years later.
The indigenous white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community that performed the rituals in the vicinity received the right to own the building.
Saint-Martin moved to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the scattered merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main trading street, and those merchants didn't want to hire black people and raise them in the service.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners wanted to rebuild it and set up a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the Carillon "the poor's bells."
The expert who played the Carillon in July called it another “cultural treasure” and “the permanent historical instrument.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first carillon to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to the larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivester, he was not replaced in St. Martin.
What has happened in Saint Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and subscribings, some of whom have been involved by church leaders, others by the bishop diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, which is composed of the leaders of the peacemakers, wrote in July to the diocese, concerned that the diocese “will try to pass on the expenses” gladly, while the council did not participate in the hiring of the architects and subcontractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese was not transparent.
Shark was traumatized by a 13-year-old boy who ran behind lobsters in California.
According to official figures, on Saturday, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, and a boy ran behind lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place almost 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been running around half an hour with his friends when he heard the boy cry for help, and along with the group, he was going to get out of the water.
Hummel first thought that it was just a catch of lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I've been eaten!
I've been tasted."
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his collarbone was completely broken.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, "in the water of the shark!" Hummel added.
The boy was taken to the Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
The rescue captain, Larry Giles, told the Army that a few weeks ago a shark had been spotted in the area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper body.
For the purposes of investigation and security, the authorities blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sunsbury's planning to go to the British make-up market
Sainsbury's going to compete with Bots, Superdrug, and Debenhams with cosmetics-like islands. Working on islands will be qualified by sellers.
As part of the increased entry into the British cosmetics market at a cost of 2.8 billion pounds sterling (which continues to rise at a time when the volume of sales of clothing and household goods is declining) the increased island with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and in the following year, if the idea is successful, the island will appear in other stores.
Invest in cosmetics is about supermarkets looking for ways to use the field space that used to be used on television, microwave furnaces, and household goods.
The Sunsbury's stated that they'll double the assortment of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees assortment will have more space: brand areas like those in shops like Bots.
The supermarket also updates the Boutique assortment: Now most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which are increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, a decorated parfum salesman, France Shop, protestes his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second one opens in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Web-shoping and moving to the purchase of small amounts of food every day in small shops makes supermarkets make extra effort to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Saintsbury's, stated that their shops would become more like a department store, as the supermarket network was trying to resist Aldi and Lidl Discounters with more services and non-food products.
Sunsbury's opening up Argos offices in hundreds of their stores, also opening a series of Habitats.Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago, claiming that it increased sales of food products, and made both networks more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to update the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested with Bots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute about how to divide the income from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after the Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) to Célesio, owner of the Loyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
They agreed that the Lloyds would help by adding an extended ascent of suite brands to care for the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vicky, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the business director of Saintsbury, stated: “We have changed the appearance of our cosmetics island to make the atmosphere more pleasing to the buyers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who would be able to give advice.
The brand assortment we have presented is called upon to satisfy any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient locations means that we are now a attractive place to buy makeup, which is to compete with the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones is "discolored" because Holly Willoughby entered into an agreement worth 11 million pounds sterling.
The star "Dreacon's Foot" Peter Jones is "discolored" because Holly Willoughby's TV host is out of a deal with his brand of goods for life (the contract is 11 million pounds sterling) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of house clothes and Truly's axes.
The couple's business was connected to the Goop Gwyneth Peltrow brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced her departure from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby led Peter Jones's Dragon Frog star to a story when at the last moment she came out of their profit-making business of goods for life to focus on the new win-win contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is “scattered” when a TV girl confessed her gold during a busy Tuesday meeting at the Jones Business Empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements costing £1.5 million of sterling mean that she no longer has enough time to devote him to their joint brand of housewear and Truly axes.
This business was linked to the Goop Gwyneth Peltrow brand and was expected to double the Willoughby money, which is estimated to be 11 million pounds sterling.
When 37-year-old Willoughby informed Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his rest houses.
The source reported: “Truly was no doubt Holly’s main priority.
It was to be its long - term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to quit business was stunned by all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
At Marlowe's headquarters, there's a full set of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the entry of the leading This Morning, which is one of the highest-paid stars in Britain, could cost firms millions because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes) and create further delays with the launch.
This may also mean the end of a long friendship.
The three children of Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
The couple spent the holidays together, and Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of the Baldwin company that is involved in television production.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as I'm lead I'm Celebrity with ITV.
The source near Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would get from news media for commenting on what someone would consider “non-presidential” and for the very positive attitude toward North Korea’s leader.
"Why did President Trump do such great things?"
said Trump, imitating the voice of the announcer. —
I didn't do anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks went into a deaf corner.
More than three months after the June alone in Singapore, North Korea’s leading diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a “appropriate response” from the United States to its first disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the US continues with the sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic when he spoke at his meeting.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such a beautiful relationship.”
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kimim had yielded positive results: the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American military officials home.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
“It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this stacked stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake in Lomboca, foreign non - governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lomboca suffered, the national catastrophe was not declared, and this is a change in the way international aid is received.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it's a bit difficult,” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Pale, it is not yet known whether foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster management agency, said that Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Pala to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
In view of the constant occurrence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains horrendously unprepared for natural rage.
Aceh has been built to protect against tsunamis, but they are not characteristic of other coastlines.
The apparent absence of a siren warning about tsunamis in Pale, although the warning was likely to have contributed to death.
Moving between a multitude of Indonesian islands is more than just in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logic even more difficult.
The medical ship that was in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake is sailing to Pale, but it will be possible to reach the site of the new catastrophe in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made improvements in Indonesia’s infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the funding deficit has created problems for Mr. Joko's administration, who plans to change in the next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by the persistence of sectarian rivalries in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands of people hung out of their homes as a result of opposition to Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool scores a goal from the field and compares the score to Chelsea.
Daniel Starridge saved the Liverpool from defeating the Chelsea in Premire's with his 89th minute naked on Saturday at the London Stadium Stadium Stadium, Stamford Bridge.
Starridge got a pass from Jerdan Shachiri when he was about 27 meters away from the Chelsea gate. At that point, his team was playing with a 1-0 account.
He rolled the ball on his left leg and loaded it in the direction of the long-distance trout.
The ball flew high above the penalty in the direction of the upper right corner of the gate.
He flew over the jumping Kap Arrisabalaga and fell into the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take that position so as not to waste time; players like Shachiri are always going to attack as much as possible, so I was just trying to make sure of as much time as possible,” said Starridge LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, and I made one touch, I didn't think about it too much, and I just took the ball.
"Chelsey" went with a score of 1-0 after the first time that Belgian star Eden Azar scored a goal for the 25th minute.
The blue attacker turned back Mateo Kovacic, turned around the middle of the field and ran fast half the Liverpool.
Kovacich quickly played into the wall in the middle of the field.
Then he made a fine penetrating pass, which brought Azar to the fine.
Azar ran the defense and struck the final left foot in the grid of the long-distance trout, and the ball passed over the Liverpool gateway by Aliceson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Napoli in the group phase of the League of Champions at 3:00 on Wednesday at the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, reported by the Indonesian disaster management agency on Sunday morning.
Many people remained trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by a seven and a half-point earthquake that caused a six-metre-high wave, reported to the press secretary of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, has been stained with wrecks of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man for suspected murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Mercyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street, suspected of having been killed by a 32-year-old man.
The police were urged to respond to people who had seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented, "The investigation is in the early stages, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious, to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who could make a video recorder, to contact us, because the information on these videos can be very important to our investigation.
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
Today, in the afternoon, friends who believe they know a woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have stated that they are now informing the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Muse just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police said no one was allowed to go in and out of the house.
When he learned what had happened, he lost the gift of speech.
The residents are now told that it will be an hour before they are allowed to return home.

There was a woman in tears at the scene of the crime.
She says, "It's so terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were standing behind the fence, and another van was standing in front of the fence.
A number of police officers were standing behind the fence and watching the apartment building.

Cromwell's statue near Parliament becomes a new monument that suffers from the “census of history”
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved payment for the destruction in the Taliban style of many cultural and religious artifacts of England by its fanatical puritan followers.
But Cromwell’s Co-owner called Mr. Crick’s offer “dreamy” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, head of Cromwell's Participatory, said: “Taking into account the current debate about the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace would become a target, was inevitable.”
Iconocracy during English civil wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his command.
Cromwell is likely to be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell, the sculptor William Hamo Thorneicroft, is evidence of the moods of the 19th century and part of the history of the post, which many think is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people, probably more in the late 19th century than now, consider Cromwell a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, a monarchy.
Whether such an idea is entirely accurate is the subject of historical debates that continue.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the known articles that represents one side of the conflict.
His achievements as the Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and honouring.”
The killer pig destroyed a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local MFIs, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the name of Yuan was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pig shop in Liupangshui, Guizhou province, reported to South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sinin, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, the pig is about to vaccinate the pigs in the pig shop.
It is reported that on Wednesday, he drove out with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw that the pigyard door was open.
The brother pointed out that there was a big boar in the pig shop with blood on his mouth.
The forensic medical experts confirmed that the 249-pound boar decimated the farmer to death.
“My cousin's legs were bloodthirsty and distorted,” stated a cousin named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evaning News that when the police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked to prevent her from attacking people.
It is reported that the seven I am Yuan and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of assault by pigs on people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295 - kg - weighted pig kept a Welsh farmer clamped to a tractor until the farmer’s wife scared the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer claimed CBC News that pigs were usually not aggressive, but blood taste could become a triger.
“They're just playful.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa’s surplus will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa was predicted to decline, moving over the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the nearest days, Rosa will bring rains with floods north of Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rose had winds of 137 km per hour (this is a hurricane of category 1) that was 5 mornings east of Sunday and 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a rainstorm is beginning to form over the Pacific, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States, and when Rose approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, it starts to push strong tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25,4 cm rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, on the nearest day, the tropical moisture that interacts with the nearest husk will create heavy rains in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 centimeters of rain can cause dangerous flooding, garbage streams, and the possibility of displacement in the desert.
Strong tropical moisture will increase the rainfall to 5–7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5–10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in a significant area of Arizona.
Flooding is possible under severe conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We urge you not to walk to the desert because there may be tropical rains.
Heavy rain can make canyons stormy rivers, and storms can bring winds and dust storms.
The nearness of the water will cause heavy rains in parts of the north coast of California.
The rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause low waste streams and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and in the morning on Monday, and on the evening of Monday and Tuesday, the rain will become more extensive.
It's going to rain hard on For Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature variations throughout the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
At times, this can lead to sharp variations in temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, a fine example of sharp temperature variations in the central United States will be observed.
It's almost a 7-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and DeMoines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to return and spread.
It is expected that in a significant area of the center and east of the United States it will be warm until October, and the temperature from the south to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above the mean temperature.
According to our long - term weather forecast, there is a high probability that average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States will exceed in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Cavanaugh case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people in six television networks watched the exciting testimony of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Cavanaugh, and Christine Blazey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which appeared to have occurred in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, channels interrupted planned programs to report the last news on Friday: a deal prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake about a one-week investigation by the FBI into the charge.
Ford told the Court Committee of the Senate that she was 100% certain that Cavanaugh was drinking her and was trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100 percent confident that that was not the case.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were watching this on Friday, as reported by the Nielsen research company.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Could not immediately get numbers from other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
By comparison, such an audience is similar in size to an audience that watches a play-off or Oscar Award.
Fox News Channel, whose broadcasters strongly supported Cavanaugh's assignment, was the leader of all the channels during the whole day's listening, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, assigned to Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, CNN had 2.52 million.
The interview remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the center of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Cavanaugh, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras were caught shouting at Flake when he tried to take the elevator to the Court's Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was barked, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I stand right in front of you,” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
It was said to him, "You have power, but many women are powerless."
Flack reported that his office published the application and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more about listening to the committee.
All cable and broad channels broadcast live hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote to advance Cavanaugh’s candidacy to the Senate in full.
Blake said he'd only do it if he knew that the FBI would look into the charges against the candidate next week, which requires a democratic minority.
Flack was partly persuaded to talk to his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Coons.
After talking to Kuns, and then with a few other Senators, Flake made a decision.
Flack’s choice had an impact, as it was evident that the Republicans would have no votes to appoint Cavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Teresa May blames critics for "political games" around Brexit.
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her exit plans from the European Union of playing politics with the future UK and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, the British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview that took place next to Teresa's interview on the front page of the newspaper, the former Foreign Minister of her government, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Checkers Plan for Brexit, saying that offering Britain and the EU to draw the toll on each other was “absolutely absurd.”
Who shot Wade Sims: The police arrested Dayton Simpson for suspecting the death of a player at the University of Louisiana.
The police arrested a suspected shooter who led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison for second-level murder, reported to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published video arguments between Simms and Simpson, and the police claimed that Simms had lost glasses during the fight.
According to an affidavited CBS TV channel WAFB, the police removed the glasses from the scene of the crime and noted that they had found Simpson’s DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed that he had shot Wade.
According to counsel, he was given a bail of $350,000.
The Coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a previous report on Friday, which states that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its appreciation to the Special Police Unit of Louisiana, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the University of the South Police Force, and the local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Allev, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for “the diligence and desire for justice.”
Simms was 20 years old.
Forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, the average result was 5.6 points and 2.6 sequestrations.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at Louisiana State University, Wil Wade, said that the team was “desolate” and “shocked” by Wade’s death.
“This is what concerns you at all times,” Wade said.
Vulcan throws ashes out on Mexico City
Popocatepetl’s ash has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Warning Center urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater began to be active and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center traced many noises and impulses.
Photos from social networks show thin ash layers on the frontal cliff of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Hogimilko.
Geophysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, following an earthquake of 7.1 points in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police encountered the Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who were pro-independence encountered a special police unit. Thousands of people joined protesters to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on division.
A masked proseparatist group that was held back by special forces threw eggs and powder paint on them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually full of tourists.
The spores took place and later that day, the police used sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, the groups of independenceists who were saying, “Let's not forget, let's not forgive!”, encountered those who were in favor of preserving the country, who were shouting, “Let's live Spain! ”
According to a local press report, fourteen people were helped with the slight injuries sustained during the protests.
One year after the referendum, October 1, which was declared illegal by Madrid but marked by Catalan separatists, tension in the region, which wants to be independent, remains high.
The voters generally voted for independence, but the appearance was low, since most of those opposed to separation boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in electoral areas throughout the region.
The independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations from being supported by the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it had to take a different route.
The 68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, claimed that he no longer had the hope that Catalan might gain independence.
"We've been through one of our best moments this past year.
I watched my parents cry with joy, which can vote, but now we're in a deaf corner," he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties, which are pro-independence parties, have not been able to maintain the momentum of this year, as many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisonment awaiting trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who withdrew a protest against police support on the phone, claimed that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in the insulator since the end of last year, announced that he would go to the European Parliament next year.
“The candidacy of European elections is the best way to condemn the regress of democratic values and repression that we are witnessing from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: The men were arrested after the car entered the house.
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after driving into a house in Londonderre several times.
The incident took place at Ballinagard Crescent at 7:30 p.m. in British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings observed that the gate and the house had been damaged.
It is possible that at some point a crossbow was fired at the vehicle.
Menga's hit gave Livingstone victory over Rangers with a score of 1-0.
The first goal of Dolly Menga in Livingstone became the winner.
A high-ranking Livingstone stunned the Rangers and brought Stephen Gerrard the second of 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The hit of Dolly Menga was decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to one level in a second from the Cybernian.
Gerrard's team won no victory at the Première's this season and the next Sunday will play with the Harts leaders, from whom it is eight points behind.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers will accept the Wenen Rapid within the European League.
In the meantime, Livingstone continues its invincible movement to six divisional games, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet been defeated after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone misses the odds that give unscrupulous guests.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they beat them, because their directness creates all kinds of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but struck along the gate, and then Alan Litgow broke through the gate after he slammed and accepted Craig Hulkett's blow along the gate, which he made his head.
The owners were satisfied that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew that they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
And that's what the final goal was.
Rangers missed the free shot, and Livingstone opened up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Menga, who took the ball and shot him off the center of the ticket.
Until then, Rangers was dominated by the use of the ball, but the protection of the landlords proved to be inexperienced and the gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, was mostly not disturbed.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's kick hit Allan McGregor by the Rangers, and Litgow hit the gate in another standard Livingston combination.
The Naves constantly flew into the Livingston penalty and were permanently neutralized, and the two penitentiaries — after the attack on Glenn Middleton and behind the game — were rejected.
Livingstone Phenomenon: Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of "BBC Scotland" at the Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal game and Livingstone result.
All of them played well, and they continued to exceed expectations on this source trajectory.
Their style of play and composition almost unchanged after returning to the highest level, but you have to give Holt the right one for how he mobilized the team after he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played grand, well organized the defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to keep an eye on each other.
Rangers, however, were not inspired.
They used to play very well under Gerrard’s direction, but now they are far from reaching those standards.
They didn't have enough of the last ball -- only once they broke the defense of the landlords -- and it was kind of a wake-up call for Rangers, which was in the middle of the table.
Erdogana was received in Cologne in a mixed manner.
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and blue sky were visible.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to restore relations among NATO’s allies.
There have been some controversy among them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdoğan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 people from meeting before the mosque, but many of the president's supporters still appeared nearby to see it.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — among them many Kurds — have also made themselves heard, condemning Erdogan’s politics and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
The bipartisan protests illustrate the ambiguity of the guest, whom some German Turks called hero and others a dictator.
Depford Road Crash: A cyclist killed in a car accident
A bicycle driver died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the Bestwood Street Crossroads and Evelyn Street on a live road in the Deptford area in the southeast of the city around 10:15 a.m. in the British Standard Time.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
This accident took place a few months after another cyclist died after a driver had escaped from an adventure on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the Saturday accident.
The London police stated that they were working to establish a man’s identity to inform his closest relatives.
Travel bans and bus routes have been changed, and motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six prisoners injured in disturbances
Six prison officers were injured by disturbances in a men's prison of strict security, reported to the prison administration.
Her Majesty Long-Lartin's prison in Woostershire started at about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, standard British time, and it's still going on.
In order to stop the disturbances, the eight incarcerated, and the eight in a single wing, a special unit called the Tornado was called up.
The officers were given medical treatment in connection with the light facial injuries sustained at the scene.
A prison official commented: “To resolve an incident in the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, a specially trained prison staff has been recruited.
Six coworkers received medical treatment for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and the terms of their stay behind the bars can be doubled.”
Her Majesty Long-Lartin's prison has more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden of the prison had been sent for static treatment after the prisoner's assault.
In October last year, a special police unit was called to prison to stop the serious disturbances in which prisoners were assaulted with white-collared layers.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding.
Tropic depression rarely hits Arizona, but this can happen early next week, since the remains of Hurricane Rosa are heading through the southwest of the desert, creating the risk of storm surges.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flooding on Monday and Tuesday, from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to walk straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday night will be rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix observed in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
and Katrina in 1967 was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, the Mogallon Rome area in Arizona is estimated to be between 5.08 and 10.16 cm, with areas of up to 15.24 cm fall.
Other areas in the southwest of the desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get between 2.54 and 5.08 cm of rain, with places that may be up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of storming, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these rains are likely to be beneficial, because the southwest is now in a dry state.
According to the American Dry Monitoring Centre, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, reportsweather.com.
First of all, Hurricane Rose's path leads to displacements on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rose, on Sunday morning, is still in a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at a speed of 19.3 km/h.
The storm is faced with more colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, and so it erupts.
Thus, it is expected that during the storm’s tropical storm during the day or Monday evening, a hurricane will cause a dislocation in Mexico.
The number of fallouts in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected that the total rainfall from Lower California to Northwest Sonora will range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm,” reportsweather.com.
Next, Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, and the border of Arizona will arrive early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will go further through Arizona, and late in the evening on Tuesday, south Utah.
“The main danger expected of Rose or her remains is the very heavy rains in Lower California, Northwest Sonouri, and Southwest American Desert,” reports the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life - threatening storms and waste streams in the deserts, as well as to displacements in the mountainous area.
Midsomer-Norton attack: four people arrested and attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after they found a 16-year-old guy with knife wounds in Somerset.
A wounded teenager was found in the Excelsior Terras area of Midsomer Norton about 4:00 p.m. in British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, reported by Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking to respond to anyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump says that Cavanaugh “did suffer the vileness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The voice of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump stated at a rally in Wilinga, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh had been “dreaming and angry” by the Democratic Party during the entire hanging process.
Cavanaugh gave a witness before Congress on Thursday, unspeakably and emotionally denouncing Christine Blazey Ford’s accusation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness at a hearing about the charges against her.
On Saturday, the president stated that the American people had seen Cavanaugh's brightness, character and courage on that day.
“The voice of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for one of the most advanced lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clean record of government service,” he said to a mob of adherents in West Virginia.
The president referred to Cavanaugh’s stand when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans’ appearance in mid-street elections.
"In five weeks, there will be one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running,' he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is “to resist and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Cavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, and CNN has been informed by an assistant of one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and casualties are on the rise
At least 384 people were killed, many were washed into the ocean when giant waves hit the beaches as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, claiming the country’s authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when a wave of up to six meters (18 feet) hit the beach in the dark, killing many to death and destroying everything on its way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 points.
“When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach, and they didn't immediately start running, and they were victims,” claimed a breeting in Jakarta, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB).
“It wasn't just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on the land,” Nugroho said, adding that, before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/year).
To escape tsunamis, some people climbed the trees and survived, he added.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
Photographs published by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been turned and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The attacks in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by a heavy earthquake on Friday was 200 times more than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could contribute to the tsunami force, said the agency.
Nugroho called the damage “broad-scale” and noted that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared without a word.
Nugroho observed that victims and injuries may be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Pala in an area called Donggal, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn't get any information” from Donggali,” Nugroho said.
Over 300,000 people live there, as reported in the Red Cross pledge, and it is added that its personnel and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
“It is already a tragedy, but it can be much bigger,” says the report.
On Saturday, the agency received wide criticism for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Pale, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
On the amortized images that people shared in social networks, a man on the top of the building shouts wild warnings about tsunamis approaching people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the water wall hit the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the trueness of the frames immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a serious shutdown of the power that cut off the connection around Pale, which made it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began sending trucks from Jakarta and other cities, reporting to the authorities, but evacuated people still need food and other essential items.
The airport of the city has been opened for help only, and it will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit evacuation centres in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is more than 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision associates with Donggaly have safely reached the city of Pale, where they hide in tarpaulins set up in the courtyard of their office, but on the way they saw the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseba.
“They told me that they had seen many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams began to act decisively to eliminate the consequences of the catastrophe, some complained that foreign aid workers with great experience were prevented from going to Pale.
According to Indonesian rules, financing, providing and providing personnel from abroad can only begin if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level,” observed Aulius Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Good, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted."
The second night had already fallen on Pala after a Friday earthquake and tsunami, and friends and families of those who had not yet been found still hoped that the arrival of their loved ones would be a miracle to paint these dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy got out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers obtained a woman who lay under stone for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, a trainer of the Indonesian National Paraplanetry Team, trained two disappeared paraplaners to participate in the Asian Games earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplaneers who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As an older paraplanerist, I have my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Hendon tells us that a few hours after the news about the ruining of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread among the paraplaners community, he was desperately sending messages on whatsApp to Pal's rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his reports were marked with only one gray point, not with double blue ticks.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered”, he said.
The thieves took $26,750 when the ATM was refilled at the Newport on the Levie
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who ran an ATM at the Newport on the Levie, a news report to the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man "walked back to Brink's coworker" and stole a sack of money to fill out.
Witnesses noticed a number of suspects fleeing crime scenes, but the police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The reper changes its name to E
Repper Kanye West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, when he announced a change on Twitter, he wrote, "The former official name is Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West was called E for a while, and he used this shortcut as a name for his June album.
The change occurred in advance of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
At the show, he replaces a singer named Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", reported by the author of the show.
This is not just a shortening of the present professional name, but West used to say that the word had a religious meaning for him.
“I believe that 'ee' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'”, said West earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with Big Boy's radio talker. —
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanye, which means "one," has been shortened to just E -- it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of a few famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Grandpa, P. Grandpa and Grandpa, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brother Love.
A former colleague of West, J.Z., also experimented with defiance and large letters.
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians.
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised never to use the army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloodthirsty massacre of students.
On Saturday, on Tlatelloloco Square, López Obrador promised “never to use the army to stifle the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military fired on a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing some 300 people, while the left student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and by opening more free public universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to crime groups.
The US needs to double funding in artificial intelligence.
Since China is building up activity in the artificial intelligence field, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this field, as the investor and practicer in the Shi Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These comments were given after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the SI, although there is no formal strategy in the U.S. in the S.I. area.
Among other things, China presented its plan last year: it wants to be number one in the SI innovation until 2030.
“The double budget for the AI study would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the US, and we are preparing for the next gap in the AI field,” Lee said.
Double-funding can double the probability that the next big achievement in the H.I. is going to be made in the U.S., said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book, "The State of the S: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director-general of the Foundation for Synovation Ventures, who invested in Face++, one of the most famous SI companies in China.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on the SH system, which beat the best American player in Othello, and later served as executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Philly of Google.
Lee observed a previous competition with technology by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of Advanced Defense Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when the next ones would be to help identify the next prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, says Lee.
“It's not China taking academic leaders, it's corporations,” he observed.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring lighters from universities in recent years to work on the CI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. to increase efforts in the field of AI.
“I think that Green Card should automatically be offered to S.I.S. candidates,” he said.
China’s National Council published its Plan for the development of the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, just like the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government agencies donate money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee of Artificial Intellect.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As far as the National Science Foundation is concerned, he now invests over $100 million a year in the IA study.
In the meantime, the U.S. lawmakers, who wanted to establish a Commission for National Security of the Artificial Intelligent, did not take any steps for a few months.
The Macedonians Vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to “the Republic of Northern Macedonia”, which would allow for the resolution of a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia’s possibility of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments entered into a treaty based on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement argue that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the minimal 50 per cent of the voters who allowed the referendum to be considered valid would be achieved.
The question in the referendum bulletin is: “Do you support membership of NATO and the EU under the terms of the Greek agreement?”
The proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that it could live freely under the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievsky in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will support it to make it decisive.
To change the name, two thirds of the votes in Parliament will be needed.
The National Election Commission stated that there were no violations reported before 1:00.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their bulletins into the boxes.
“I've come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” stated the 62-year-old elector Giose Tanevski in the capital of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumic, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zayev of Macedonia, his wife Zorika and his son Dusko gave their vote in a referendum to change the name of the country, which would open the way to NATO and the European Union.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodymyr Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and placed chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go there with our head up proudly, not through the service door,” said the Kavardarkovs.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zayev believes that NATO membership will bring many needed investments to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the majority vote in favour, since more than 80 per cent of our citizens stand for the EU and NATO,” Zayev said after the vote.
He pointed out that the outcome “yes” would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, 30 to 43 percent of the voters will participate in the referendum, which is the following.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telema, 57 percent of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be declared valid, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the politics of the pro-Western government since its inception last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City goes through the entire Brayton defense and scores a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling went through Briton's defense and won the Manchester City with a score of 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero Hall looked like a funny, simple game at the 65th minute.
The Argentinian attacker was given a pass at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three Brighton protectors and ended up in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went around one defender, then he ran around a few more on the edge of the Briton.
Then he made a pass to the left when he saw Sterling.
An English forward made the first touch on the penalty line to hand over the Aguero ball, which, with its right boot, launched it in the right side of the gate, defeating Matthew Ryan's Brighton holkiper.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs," said the Citi manager Pep Guardiola.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That was the case.
We're lucky he scored the goal at this moment.”
But the initial advantage of the celestial blue in this match was that of Sterling.
This goal took place at the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Briton's area.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Leroy Sanae.
Leroy made a few touches, and he went on to pass Sterling in the direction of the long line.
Forward of the sky-blue threw the ball into the gate just before he slipped out.
The City will meet Hoffhenheim in the group phase of the League of Champions at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Raine-Nekkar Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take the glasses to Roxie.
Since the Washington Nasionals team came out of playoffs, there were no major reasons to wait for the next start.
But a rival Sherzer hopes to go to the petcher mountain on Sunday in a match against Colorado Rockies, provided that Roxies still has difficulty getting to playoffs. Now Roxies is one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
The Rockies have at least a Wild Card for winning the 5-2 account over the Nasionals on Friday night, but they still want to secure the title of the first division.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to leave the ball, knowing how the viewers are doing here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level that I've seen this year.
Why don't I want to take part in this competition?
The Nationals will announce who will be the starter on Sunday, but it is reported that they are leaning towards Sherzer.
Sherzer, for whom this is going to be the 34th start, has a pitching session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, usually his weekend.
The Washington right hand has a score of 18-7 of the 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump meetings in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation around his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the appearance of Republican supporters in mid-street elections.
“Everything we have done will be at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will be held.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere I can,” he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And they're firmly configured to restore power using any means, you see vileness, shit.
They don't care who's suffering from them, who's the one who needs to get over to get power and control, they want power and control, we don't want to give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, “to resist and obstruct.”
“And you've seen it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “sleak and mean, disgusting and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Court Committee, calling the Democrat Senator Diane Finestein by name, which provoked the audience to hear loud rumors of discontent.
"Remember her answer?
Did you file a document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was a really bad language of the body rovers -- the worst language of the body rovers I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to convict me, it was hardly unexpected.
Finally, I'm the last of those Labour members of Parliament to be told that they're not happy, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
My Parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated almost the same way because she was determined to oppose anti-Semiticism.
I was convicted for not agreeing with Jeremiah Corbin.
As for the importance of responsible economic policy, as far as national security is concerned with Europe, these questions are ironically similar to those on which Jeremiah disagreed with previous leaders.
A report about the Nottingham East meeting on Friday says, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labourers were like this.
Sadly, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of “more benevolent, softer” politics has long been forgotten if it has ever been implemented.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not allow for different views, and every thought is valued from the position of whether it is acceptable to lead the party.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, and the circles with which I thought I had similar political views began to expect that I would turn 180 degrees and accept positions that I would never agree with, whether national security or the EU's only market.
Every time I speak in public — and it doesn't matter what I say — this is followed by a series of attacks in social networks with calls for revoking, condemning central politics, and I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know what I've had more luck with than some of my colleagues, because the comments I've received are usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who encounter daily sexual or racist attacks, but never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of distrust or change in the rules of selection, the party is shrinking.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice, and I have been urged not to stand up, not to speak so loudly, that “everything will be fine.”
But that's not why I came to politics.
I joined the Labourers 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the lack of attention from the Tetcher government has literally broken down my middle school class, and since then I have sought to improve the quality of government services for those who need them most, whether it be a local councilman or a government minister.
I never hid my policy, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been disturbed by my political views and differences with current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday's events, I just want to say one thing: in the context of a country marching towards Brexit, which would damage homes, businesses and government services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Notingham's Time, but for my electionists, both members of the Labour Party, and not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of revoking me or any political advantage will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: the invincible Air rises up
The last two attempts may have distorted some of the final results, but there is no doubt that Air has earned a triumph in today's wonderful entertainment match, the Premièreship of Scotland.
Now they're in charge of the table, it's the only team invincible of ten.
After all, the excellent defense and improved ability to take advantage of the opportunities gives the owners and coach Peter Merchi the full right to be satisfied.
"We've been through our games so far, and we're still invincible, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose commented, "I'm giving the Air dues, they're better off taking the chances than we are."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, implemented by Frazier Climo, led Air forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, released by Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Climo reinforced Air's leadership with a penalty, and right before the break, made and implemented a solo attempt that gave 17-5 for Air.
But Melrose started the second time well, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, implemented by Baggot, reduced the break to five points.
Afterwards, there was a prolonged delay due to the severe trauma of Rouard Knott, who was pulled out of the field on the load, and from the Ayr restart, they fled ahead with a try by Stafford McDauwell, which was carried out by Climo.
Captain Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay the unfulfilled attempt of Bruce Colvin under intense pressure.
The owners returned, but when Straan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the line of the penalty line, MacPherson made a touchdown behind the Air moth.
Climo tried what he did almost every time after reset, and then Kyle Rowe got hit by David Armstrong in the box and sent a flunker to Gregor Henry at the fifth attempt of the host team.
Looks like the star of the "Already Game" series is set up for a new career in the restaurant sphere.
It seems that the star of the "Already Game" series, Ford Kieran, has been set up for a new career in hospitality, which can be concluded once it has become known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC TV series, a script he writes to and in which he shoots with a long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemfield.
Duet announced that the future ninth series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craigslist.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmore Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter the "prosperous restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The Sea of Ours": Internal Bolivia hopes that the Court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling a well-equipped fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings are hanging an ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with a motto: “The sea is our right.
We have to get him back."
In Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline, which left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century over natural resources, and the desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia awaits the judgment of the international court on October 1, after five years of trial.
“Bolivia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and tranquillity, and, of course, it expects a positive outcome,” commented Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, and they hope that the Tribunal in Gaas will take a decision in the interests of Bolivia, that after decades of incomplete conversations, Chile will be forced to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his reconfiguration the following year, also puts great hope in the decision that will be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision for Bolivia, and if that happens, little will change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, does not have the authority to condemn Chilean territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision was made only six months after the final arguments were given indicates that the case was “not complicated”, told Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia’s case has not progressed; the last four years may have contributed to the reversal.
“The thirst for access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
The war rhetoric of Morales blew up the remains of Chile’s benevolence, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, disagreed that the court’s approval was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of Chile’s relationship and a chance to end 139 years of differences with each other,” he said.
Calçadia also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the maritime issue as a political tool.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
This decree is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there's no nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the U.S.
Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho of North Korea says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during its loneliness in Singapore by the leaders of the countries of the superstitious countries.
His comments appeared when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of relaunching nuclear diplomacy, which had entered a deaf corner more than three months after the Singaporean alone with Kim Chen In.
Rí says that the belief that the continuation of the sanctions and the US-wide declaration of the end of the Korean War will one day put North Korea on its knees is a “incessant dream.”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps to disarm.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously abandoning its arsenal, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second alone between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion shows, the latest trend of massive majors that are already on the main streets of your city was presented.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely hide from the sun, you've found what you need.
Valentino and Tom Brown's designers demonstrated a series of excentrical masterpieces in the opera style of the spring summer 2019 event of the brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats filled Instagram this summer, and the designers named have already sent their insatiable creations beyond the range.
Valentino turned out to be an extravagant beige hat with wide-painted feathers covering the model heads.
Among the other outcast axes are painted with precious stones of coffee, the hat of the witch, and even the hat of the ananas, but they're not to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks — very timely before Halloween.
Many of these colored masks had their lips stitched and were more like Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One was like an underwater swim with a tube and glasses, and another looked like a crack of ice cream that melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
The Oversea-capelujahs became fashionable thanks to the La Bomby, a straw hat with a width of 60 centimetres, which was seen on all of them, from Rianna to Emily Ratazhkovski.
The cultural brand behind a very impractical hat, which was seen everywhere in social networks, gave the world another creation: a straw-sized beach bag almost as big as a model in a bathing suit that carried it.
A bag of yellow-red raffia with a raffia rag and a white skin pen was the central element of the La Riviera spring-summer 2019 brands of Jacquemus in the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “In the coming summer, I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the designer’s influence is so enormous that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for an oversea-axis.
John Edward: Knowledge of the language is a duty to citizens of the world.
Independent schools in Scotland maintain high standards of learning, and in 2018 they again received excellent results from individual and collective studies in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which teach more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SHED), and they want to provide the best level of services for the students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for the further and higher education they have chosen for their career and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language she understands, she understands it with her mind.
If you speak to her in her native language, she accepts it with her heart.”
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year's examinations, we see that in independent schools, languages are used in ratings of the best grades.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages scored a higher A.
Data collected in 74 schools in the SSR revealed that 72% of students received a higher A from Chinese, and a further 72% from German students, 69% from French students, and 63% from Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital to the life skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages as a choice object are now presented as NTIM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), as part of independent school programs, and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of the reasons why employers cannot close vacancies are due to a lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising positions require knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if someone learns a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages the advantage of competitors.
According to a 2013 YouTube survey of over 4,000 British adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double - sized percentage (15 percent).
That's why investing in language teaching is now important to modern children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those in developing countries, will provide children with more opportunities to find a full - time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn its own languages.
A series of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important language in Britain from the 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, independent schools will always be able to choose several languages to study with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for them.
Now, it can't be denied that in the international business environment, languages continue to be vital to a future country, so it has to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, variety, and perfection to Scottish youth.

LeBron debuts with Lakers in San Diego.
The fans who want to see the first launch of L'Bron James for Los Angeles Lakers almost waited.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play Sunday on the first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll be playing, not yet decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, reported that James would play a limited number of minutes more quickly.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season graphics games.
“In this phase of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare,” he replied.
Trump meetings in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of pre-election meetings today from the city of Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trump meetings planned for the next week, including those in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidate he offered to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump wants to form support for future mid-town elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress after voting in November.
About what hour will Trump’s evening meeting in West Virginia take place today, and how will we view it on the Internet?
Trump meeting in the city of Wiling, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 hours easttime today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below on YouTube.
Trump probably mentions the tensions that took place this week over a candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, charged with sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate's vote for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans gain popularity before the November elections.
President Trump's representatives stated that these five meetings the following week were aimed at “activation of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” reports Reuters.
“The control of the Congress is so critical to its day order that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the tense pre-election campaign season is coming,” said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign, who did not want to call his name.
At the Vesbanko Arena Stadium in the city of Wiling, today's rally can be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as by the media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday’s visit will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the last month, where he won more than 40% of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate from the Republicans to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisy, whose ratings are lagging behind the polls.
“ It’s not good for Morrisy that the president is coming to raise his poll ratings, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team is set up to fight and is filled with hope for Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended with a one - side victory, Saturday’s forsomas can be exactly what this Ryder Cup was missing.
The swing pendulum of the impulse is a completely fictional sports concept that players really believe in, especially in similar competitions.
So when do they say the impulse works?
“They were six points ahead, and now four, so I think we're taking it a little bit like a impulse,” Jordan Spit said when he left.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
Americans, Spit says, feel a little wind in their windmills, and they're also encouraged by a lot, not the last time, by Spit and Justin Thomas, who've been playing together all day, and each earns three points out of four.
Spit and his killer blows from the midget to the fire show an example.
These throat screams of the celebrations became louder when, in the continuation of his round, he made a decisive patch and balanced the score at the fourth match after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His path, which allowed them to win a game on 15 holes, met with a similar scream, which tells you that the American team doesn't seem.
“You really just have to try hard and worry about your own game,” Speith said.
That's all each of these players left now.
18 holes to be known.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood — are the irrefutable story of Ryder Cup.
It's unusual, but a charming couple in Europe has four out of four and can't make mistakes.
Molivud was the only couple who didn't make the boga on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to escape the boggy on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This run, and the way their energy seems to flow to this stormy crowd and back, makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players other than Fleetwood or Molinari to secure the potential victory of the Europeans when the sun passes over Le Golf National.
Both are desirable at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the European triumph.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning troupes, when he was in a relationship with Alex Noren.
One bohga and two dabs on the first nine holes led the Spaniard and the Swede to a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to observe foreboals and foresoms because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and it is interesting to see how strategies can change overnight.
So far, Europe is playing better than a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of forsoms has also shown that the US team is going to fight, which some, especially Americans, are questioning.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
On the closing day, the Ryder Cup of Europe will have a solid advantage, for after Saturday's forbes and fors, it is ahead of the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired duet by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the lost Tiger Woods, and now on Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to recover the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning forges with 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the forsoms and won two matches, but could not reduce the breakup.
Jim Furic's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points together, while he and Mollinari (the Mallywood) are only the second pair to score four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After breaking up Woods and Patrick Reed in forballs, they joined together to defeat the swelling Woods and the American novelty Bryson Deshambo with an even more effective 5th4.
Woods, who pulled out two games on Saturday, showed random outbreaks of genius, but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in forballs and fors and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning trout, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in the forsoms to be defeated with a score of two hundred and one from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka, which is the first and third of the world's ratings.
Europe couldn't do everything in its own way this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
The three leading winners, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two points.
They won a decisive victory over the Spaniards, John Ram and Ian Polter, in trout, and later defeated Polter and Rory McLroy with a score of 403 in fors, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team returned with four points in the singles, although Furik's team only needed nothing to save the trophy.
After the second place in two days, however, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it can’t.
North Korea says that “not in any case” will be disarmed in one-sided order without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepens mistrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country will never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that last year, North Korea had adopted “off-the-shelf measures of goodwill”, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing itself not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Well, we don't see the response from the United States," he said.
“With no confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to disarm in one-sided order.”
And while Ri repeated North Korea’s familiar grievances about Washington’s “phase-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his claim was important because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization that Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Chen In and Donald Trump's joint statement on the first-ever single-hand statement between the real president of the United States and North Korea leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called on him to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”, and Trump promised a security guarantee to North Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on "denuclearization at first" and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even denies "the end of war," Ri said.
“Considering that the sanctions can put us on our knees is the unfulfilled dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the extension of the sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ree did not mention the plans of the second one between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader emphasized at the UN early in the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If South Korea, rather than the United States, were the party to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, would not have gone into such a deaf corner.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from that of the General Assembly when he told the General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after the “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” who wanted to commit suicide.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened “full destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said that much more needed to be done and that the sanctions should remain in force until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump observed that he did not set a time frame for this: “It will take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, US Superintendent Mike Pompeo stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue energetically and without hindrance until we see a complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for nuclear programs and Ballistic missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that he was visiting Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for the second alone.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but after a few hours, North Korea convicted him of “gangster demands.”
During this month's meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States used “the appropriate measures”.
He said that, according to Kim, he needed “adversarial measures” to guarantee the security that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year provided all of its students with more sleep, an attempt to fight the growing culture of coolness of learning all night after the pumping of caffeine.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigam Women’s Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first in the United States.
He decided to start a course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end, one girl approached him and said, "Why are they telling me this now, in the final course?"
“She told her that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” said a teacher from The Telegraph.
In the course first introduced this year, students are taught the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results and improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of mental health at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the University, explained that the university had decided to introduce the course after it had been discovered that students had been seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The clock course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's an image of a room in a dorm room where students click cups of coffee, curtains, gymnasiums and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deficiency on sports performances, and the importance of routines associated with sleep.
Another chapter tells participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the interactive icon map encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Chesler.
The culture of pride in sleeplessness still exists, he added, and also pointed out that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means that the problem of sleep deprivation is increasing.
A sufficient sleep of good quality should be the student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, even a set of heavy weights, because sleep deprivation puts the brain into hunger, which causes permanent physical hunger, he told.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian researcher in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler to develop a course after joining one of his other courses last year during the first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all aspirants to attend a similar training program before entering a competition agency.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students be reminded to go to bed and to set up an alarm and to be aware of the harmful effect of “blue light”, which is emitted by electronic screens and light - diode lamps, and which can disrupt the circadian rhythm, which causes problems with swelling.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal discouraged Gerrard's boys
The Rangers experienced a queue attack of grief: a strike by Dolly Menga led to a distinct team of Steven Gerrard's defeat with a score of 1-0 from Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to win its first victory in the game after the lute triumph over St. Johnston with a score of 4-1, but the Gary Holt team defeated Gerrard the second as manager of the 18 games. Gerrard's team remained at eight points behind the Scottish Premiership Harts leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, which lacked inspiration, didn't look like it could match the score.
Now, "Renders are down to the sixth position, and Livingstone is up to the third position, and by the difference of the ball, they're only ahead of the Cybernian.
In addition, the Rangers may have another problem, as the lineman Kalum Spence was forced to treat the head wound after he was thrown into the guest sector with an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that once passed through Air in the halffinals of the Scottish League Cup.
And Holt released the same "Livie 11" warehouse, which took one point at the Harts last week, and was thrilled by the way his swamped boys squeezed the rivals at each end.
The Rangers may have dominated the power of the ball, but Livingstone worked more with the ball they got.
They were supposed to kill in just two minutes of the game, when the first pass of Menga into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gates of Allan McGregor, but the half defender was wasted this great chance by sending a ball over the gate.
Keahan Jacobs's deep free shot got to Skipper Craig Hulket, but his defense partner Alan Litgow hit the back pants.
Rangers did get control, but on the last third there was more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should be entitled to a penalty at the mark of a quarter hour after the encounter with Stephen Lawless, but the referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers managed to hit only two of the gates in the first half, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, was hit by the head of Lassana Kulibali and the calm strike by Ovie Ejaria was almost inconvenient.
And while the 34-minute outpost of Livingston may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they only earned it by their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' preparations.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who peacefully chose Menga for a simple ending.
In the break, Gerrard replaced the Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the winner got to Morelos, but the astonishing Kelly got out of his line to block it.
However, Livingstone continued to force guests to play the same game they liked when Litgow and Halkett took one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved the results at the last stages, but McGregor was very good at resisting Jacobs before Litgow hit the corner.
Glenn Middleton, replaced by Rangers, made another late application for a penalty when he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson looked back.
Almanach: Geiger’s Inventor
And now the page from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and the time is coming... a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm, Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as Geiger’s meter.
Since then, the professional Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example, in the 1950 "Call the Crown" film with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play doubtful cowboys.
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effect on atoms of radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: "Oh, my God, it's really cracking right now!"
He died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name continues to live.

The method is to remove immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory.
Then these cells are able to "see" proteins that are common to many cancers, and then these cells inject the patient again.
Test vaccines show promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can "see" common to many protein cancers (HER2), and continuing to reintroduce these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski of the United States National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which is to remove immune cells in patients and “teach” them to target cancer cells, has worked to treat one of the types of leukemia.
After the appearance of the SNL show at the MAGA baseball game, Kanye West did a sharp speech to support President Trump,
the negative reaction of the viewers
The audience at the SNL studio was taught by Kanye after his sad performance, during which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would be running for the presidency in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town, in a baseball cap labeled "Let's Return America's Former Fame," he exploded with a tirade in which he criticized the Democrats, and again claimed his support for Trump.
"White people often ask me, "How do you like Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if racism bothered me, I would have left America long ago," he said.
SNL began with Matt Damon's sketch, in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee in the case of Christine Blazey Ford's sexual assault.
Although West’s speech was not broadcast in direct ephirius, Chris Rock’s social media comedian posted the video with his tirade.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to make West laugh by posting this post.
West also complained to the viewers that he had a bad situation behind the barn because of the head cleaner.
According to the Washington Examiner, West said, "When I was behind the cliffs, I was brutally treated.
I was told, "Don't go to the viewers in this baseball cap."
They bullied me!
And then they tell me that I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
West continued, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'm gonna put on my superman cap because nobody can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep moving?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to Variety's weekly, his comments at least twice provoked a negative reaction by the audience in the room, and the actors in the SNL show looked confused, and one of the viewers said, "The studio's got dead silence."
Westa was last invited to replace Arian Grande, whose former boyfriend, Reper McMiller, died a few days before the Ethir.
West surprised many by performing the song I Love it (I love it) in a Perrier bottle of water suit.
Westa was supported by the head of the conservative organization TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the most funny:
Instead, Karen Gunther, the talk host, wrote on Twitter that the West "is who he is, and that's just great."
"I don't want to reward him (buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, professes and casts out the ideology that harms my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: he was now "the one who was previously known as Kanye West."
West is not the first performer to change his name, he's following the example of Grandpa, also known as Puff Grandpa, Puffy and Pip Grandpa.
Snoop Dog was previously known as Snoop Lyon, and, as we know, the music legend of the last decades, Prince changed the name into a symbol, and then became "The Artist Formerly known as Prince."
Charges of attempted murder after a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported an incident at the Belligecamore restaurant.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The prosecutor's office will look into the charges.
The Star of the Grey of Thrones series, Keith Gerington, condemns the idealization of bruteness.
Keith Guerington became famous for the role of a soldier with a sword, John Snow, in the brutal mid-life fantasy series "The Grass of Thrones" produced by HBO.
However, a 31-year-old actor denounced the stereotype of a hero-macho, arguing that because of such heroes on screens, young boys often feel that they have to be cool enough to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Keith, he said that he thought "something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of idealization of bruteness in the era of popularity of the hashtag #Meto.
Keith, who recently married his partner in the Grey Thrones, a 31-year-old actor, Rose Leslie, pointed out that he was quite determined to fight this problem.
"I'm quite determined at the moment. "When did we get on the sluggish path of idealizing bruteness?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up from the perspective of the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing violence through images of extremely courageous heroes.
He continued, "What's natural, what's being planted?
Why does television and street teach that young boys feel pressure to be such men?
I think today's really important question is, "How do we change this?"
'Cause it's obvious that the young boys are off the right track.'
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filming in any sicwells and sicwells of the Greys of Thrones after the show was completed in the next summer, because "he's already done with the battles and the horses."
Since November, Keith will play "The Real West" by Sam Shepard – stories about the film producer and his robber brother.
As the actor recently admitted, he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best he's ever received from the Grey of Thrones series.
"From the time of filming in this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life," said Keith.
In a fantasy series that won the Emmy Awards, Rose played the game -- the love of the hero Gerington John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018, and the ceremony took place in Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a sharp increase of 14% in new cases
In China, a sharp increase of 14 percent in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS was reported.
According to health authorities, there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted by sex, indicating a change in the old trend.
For a long time, in some parts of China, HIV was rapidly spread through infected blood during transfusions.
However, according to official health authorities during a conference held in Yunnan Province, the number of people infected with HIV has fallen to almost zero.
Compared to the previous year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The temporary sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT people often suffer from discrimination.
According to research, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men marry women later because of the country’s conservative values.
In most cases, transmission occurs as a result of improper use of protective devices during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV - related drugs in a way that is partly designed to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of intelligence senators' data online by her regular employee and criticizes dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denounced the allegation that one of her regular employees had posted the personal data of three American senators in the Wikipedia.
The L.A. Democrat claims that these statements spread ultra-right political viewers and websites.
"Little, lies, and then even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
According to reports, the published information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing before the Senate Commission about charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the post of Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The data leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
The Hill has reported that conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have revealed that the IP address of the outflow is linked to the Waters office and has been able to locate data from its full-time coworker.
"These baseless assertions -- absolutely false, they don't match reality," said Waters.
"The half-worker of my office, whose personal data and security are at risk as a result of these fabricated and false claims, has nothing to do with the flow of this information.
These unsubstantiated assertions are totally false, they are untrue."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the web, among others by former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This denial is filled with anger," wrote Fluisher.
"It suggests that with that character she cannot be a member of the Congress.
If a person is accused of what he did not do, he does not need to become angry.
The accused should not behave arrogantly.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
"He must remain calm and intrusive."
It seems that Fleisher was running parallels between Waters' reaction and the Democratic criticism at Judge Cavanaugh's address, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is trying to take Waters' place after the results of the inter-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is news, if it's true," he wrote.
In her pledge, Waters stated that her office had already reported these false claims to “the responsible state and law enforcement bodies”.
"We will do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they answered the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
"Agent Johnny English: The New Mission" -- a spies parody with Rowan Atkinson.
It's already a good tradition to look in every new British film for Braxit's ideas, and they're in a new part of a series of Jonny Inglish playwrights, and the first film, "Johnny Inglish", was released in 2003, and later renewed in 2011, with "Jonny Inglish: restarting".
Will the ironic and ironic self-satisfaction of what we are a misguided, new export potential of the nation?
One way or another, Johnny Inglish with his moving face and glutted eyes was once again able to make a mess, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
Johnny, as we know, is a ridiculously fun secret agent, in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, is a little bit from Inspector Clouseau, a little bit from Mr. Bin, and a lot of things – from the guy who played one note of the film "Fire Wheelers" at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The character is also foreshadowed by a traveler and an international mystery that has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten TV commercial by Barclaycard.
In the last film about Johnny Ingleish, there are a few beautiful moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglish, in his uniforms, was approaching the helicopter, and the shovels of the rifle were on his helmet every day.
Atkinson's talent to set up a buffonade is beautifully revealed in the film, but the humour passes, and in some respects it is too much, especially when compared to "serious" movies, such as Agent 007 and Mission Impossible, one of the "ingredients" of which is also a comedy.
It seems that jokes are more focused on children than on adults, and I do not seem as ingenious and thoughtful as the Atkinson in the silent Bin movies.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
A hacker infiltrates the British super-secret spy network and uncovers the names of all field agents, which was a total surprise to an active agent (apparently, Kevin Eldon played only an episodic role in the film).
This proved to be the last crumb of the Prime Minister, a haughty person who has already experienced destructive criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity. ( Emma Thompson tried to convey the image of Theresa May, but the script did not allow it to be fully uncovered.)
Intelligence counsellors informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she needed to involve someone from behind.
Choice falls to the indecent Johnny Inglish, who now works as a teacher in some super-mode school and informally teaches children to operate under cover (in this part, with a spy "school of the year" in England, there were a few good jokes for teenagers).
The Inglisha is rushed to Whitehall for a short-term breeze, where he meets again with his long - suffering friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller for the next time.
Buff is now married to a captain of a submarine (the role of an exalted, annoying person does not exactly match Vicki Pepperdin’s talent).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went squeaky, Batman and Robin are back in line and suddenly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletov, who is playing Olga Kurilenko.
And at this time, the prime minister comes under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his wealth in technology and technology and claims that he can solve the problem with the British network, the vicious Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Baf go on a trip and return to their funny boots: dressed by waiters, they start a fire in a fancy French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally traveling abroad on Volta’s luxurious yacht; and Inglish makes a real mess when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to learn about the planning of Volta’s house.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but with his kindness and fury, he is something like a movie for children.
It's a walk-through movie.
Like watching other films about Johnny Inglish, I asked myself the same question: Can't the British film industry offer Rowena Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Laborists deny the preparation of a plan under which the British will work four days a week, but get paid in five days.
Jeremiah Corbina's Labour Party has to discuss a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but they'll get paid in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to require company managers to transfer funds saved by the revolution of artificial intelligence to employees, giving them an extra weekend.
Thus, the workers will have a three - day weekend and bring home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea will be consistent with the party’s economic programme and direct the country’s resources to support the working class.
The move to a four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of the Third Union, and it is hoped that the workers will be able to benefit from a change in the general-conomic situation.
A source at the Labour Party reported to The Sunday Times: "Policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week is consistent with the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party.”
Laborists were not the first to endorse this idea, because the Green Party promised to set up a four-day working week during the pre-election campaign of 2017.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment approve of such a desire.
The Speaker of the Labour Party stated, "The party's political agenda does not include a four-day working week, so we're not considering this idea right now."
"The Shadow" Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the pre-election meeting of the Labour Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell claimed that he was configured to take back power from the "faceless directors" of the Communal Enterprises and the "visitors."
The Black Chancellor's plan also means that water companies' shareholders may not get all their share of the capital if the Labour government introduces “counting” on the basis of perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in company rule and to create integrating equity funds to transfer 10% of the usual private sector shares to workers who are expected to experience annual dividends of up to 500 pounds sterling.
Lyndsey Grame and John Kennedy talk on 60 Minutes, or can the FBI's Cavanaugh investigation change their mind.
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh, who is in charge of the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court has been postponed at least a week, and the question arises whether the senators of the Republicans will continue and continue to support Cavanaugh after the results of the investigations of the bureau have been published.
On Sunday 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearings, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you really do it?"
He was determined, steadfast, uncompromising."
It seems that Graham’s mind will no longer change.
"I think Kavano's indictment is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it," he added by Gray, turning to Christine Blazey Ford.
And everyone she calls can't prove it under oath.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't know what's going to change."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
On this Saturday, New York will be hosting the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the music world with a staggering number of star artists and an equally devastating mission – to fight poverty around the world.
During the seventh festival of the Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be mobing in the Grand Galway of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to draw attention to the true goal of the festival – the organizers want to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors have to do a number of jobs or "acts", like taking a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or anything else to help draw attention to the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results, since Global Citizen's organizers have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is it really the idea of rewarding a free concert -- a genius way to convince people to demand action, is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" when people feel that something is really changing by signing an electronic petition or doing a Twitter publication?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have documented 19 million "acts" of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to declare planned financial allocations and programs worth more than $37 billion, which will help to change the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 financial obligations and public statements as an example of its performance, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to estimates by the group, some 649 million people around the world have been directly affected.
Among the major financial obligations are the Power of Nutrition Foundation, which is territorially related to Britain. In the framework of the project, investors and implementers committed themselves to "helping children grow up" and promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million in assistance to deal with the problem of malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Cities.
"With the support of the British government, mercenarisms, governments of other countries and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history," said a representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Wallman, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 “acts” that called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced the disbursement of funds for the Power of Nutrition project, which was aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "What do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?"
The representatives of Global Citizen wrote, "This is a long and hard way, so sometimes we fall, and we're going to fail.
However, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, band The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Jianelle Mona, is just part of the star performers who will perform this year at the New York Festival, and weigh Deborah-Lee Fernes and Gyu Jackman.
The Minister of Internal Affairs stated that the US could use naval forces for the "block" to prevent the export of Russian energy.
According to the U.S. Minister of Internal Affairs, Ryan Zinke, quoted at Washington Examiner, Washington could “receive” the help of the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it works to invite a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy sources.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to be an energy broker, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the governor, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"The U.S. Navy can provide free passage by sea routes and, if necessary, block them to prevent Russian energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the parties to the event, which was carried out by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that stands for itself as the "voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He then compared the approach to trade with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they were actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy efficiently and replace it with alternative ones," he said, calling Russia "one-sided," because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While these claims were being heard, Trump’s administration set out to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by dispersing the Russian energy market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To this end, Trump’s officials and President Donald Trump themselves are trying to persuade the German government to abandon the “incomprehensible” construction project of the North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Northflow 2 gas station, which costs $11 billion and will double the capacity of existing gasgon to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
The Kremlin convinces Washington that it is only against the project for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my view, we share the view that energy can't be a tool of pressure and the consumer should be able to select suppliers," said the Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak after meeting the U.S. energy minister Rick Perry, which took place in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization of the Federal Union of the German Industry (BDI) has urged the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country intervenes in our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Union of the German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is going to "think seriously" about running for president in 2020.
The senator from Massachusetts states Elizabeth Vorren announced on Saturday that he would think seriously about running for president after an election.
During a meeting with the public in Goliac, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of standing for election.
According to The Hill Warren, "The women have to go to Washington and set up the government, and to that end there must be a woman in his head."
"After November 6th, I will seriously think about running my candidacy for president."
During her meeting with the public, Warren expressed her appreciation for Donald Trump's presidency, saying that he would "take his country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open - minded, criticizing Trump and his nomination for the post of Justice of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh.
In Friday's tweet, Warren wrote, "...of course, before the FBI votes, it's time for an investigation."
However, according to the polls published on Friday, most of Warren’s voters do not believe that it should go on the road in 2020.
In line with the survey conducted jointly by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential voters in Massachusetts state expressed their opposition to the senator's nomination.
Thirty-two percent supported the elevation.
The results of the survey showed that more support was being provided by former Governor Deval Patrick, and that 38 percent, against 48 percent, had been expressed for his potential presidentship.
During the discussions on the candidates of other prominent Democrats who may be running in 2020, former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders are also called.
According to Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions the PTSD of Track Palin during a rally to support Donald Trump.
The 26-year-old Treque Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through right now, what he's going through after his return, can only be understood by other families that are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are coming home with," she said in front of a rally to support Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called Trac's arrest "a problem that nobody's paying attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "return home not as cruel as they used to be, and want to know if they respect what they've done here as brothers of soldiers, pilots and other military officers for this country."
According to a spokesman for the police department of Vassilla, Den Bennett, Trac was arrested on Monday in Wasillah, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as obstructing a report of violence and carrying weapons in a state of drunkenness.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the complaint of asylum policy
Eighteen states and a district of Colombia support the complaint of a new U.S. policy that denies refugee status to victims of gang persecution and domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts sent an analytical note by a court consultant to Washington to support a lender who needed shelter and complained about the policy in court order.
The full name of the lender in the Grace v. Sachs case, called by the American Civil Rights Alliance, which complains about federal politics and which was filed in August, will not be solved.
The client claimed that her partner, "and his cruel son bandits," beat her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for shelter on July 20.
It was illegally held in Texas.
Public prosecutors who support Grace's suit stated that the residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees who often request shelter in the United States) often face serious problems such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status overturns the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board’s decision that undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence could seek refuge.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, General Carl Reysin, stated on Friday's speech that the new policy “did ignore decades of state, federal and international laws”.
“Federal law requires that the decision on the application for refugee status be based on a review of the facts and circumstances laid down in such a pledge, and the prohibition violates this principle”, is the analytical note by a court counselor.
In the analysis, the prosecutors then argue that the policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States is damaging to the economy of the country, because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "make up the necessary labour resources."
Attorney General Jeff Sachs issued an order to immigration judges in June that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
“The shelter is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial affiliation, religion, nationality, membership of certain public groups or political views”, said Ceshnes on 11 June.
The provision of shelter was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers desperately seek out survivors while the death toll in Pala doubled
For survivors, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, comforting her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Pala.
"Every minute, quick help brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water."
Some people go back to their destroyed homes, and they take out the flooded benefits, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 points on Richter’s scale are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including two of Gerris with a fractured back and shoulder, are resting near the building of the Pala Army Hospital, where patients are provided with help in the open sky through constant repulsions.
His eyes were filled with tears when he remembered how a strong push hit the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I've been squeezed in the midst of the debris of the wall," told Geris to correspondent Assocated Press, adding that he and his family came to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife beg for help, and then the silence prevailed.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "recovering psychological pressure" through "advertising that contains propaganda"
A week after the Chinese national newspaper posted four pages of American daily advertising material on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump of the United States spent the past Wednesday on a fee-paying supplement to China Daily in Des Moins Register – the most popular newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to influence Congressional elections on November 6, China rejects these accusations.
According to Reuters, official officials in the United States reported that Trump’s allegations that he accused Beijing of attempting to intervene in American elections meant a new phase of escalation on the part of Washington, whose aim was to pressure China.
While foreign governments can post commercials to boost trade, there is a trade war between Beijing and Washington, D.C., in which they have already raised import tolls.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the initiation of a repressive tower in China was intended to strike exporters from states like Iowa who supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest agricultural exporter to China, claimed that China had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in the column of Des Moins Register Sunday, "energizes pressure by publishing advertising that contains propaganda, in our independent press."
"In order to spread propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by placing a paid advert in Des Moins Register," wrote Brenstead.
"On the other hand, in the street layouts here in Beijing, you're only looking for individual voices of dissatisfaction, and you're not going to see a true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is a source of concern, which leads to the conclusion that China's MIs are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the respectful Chinese editions offered to publish" his article, but he did not name which one.
Analysts warn that the failure of Cavanaugh by Republicans set up women voters against themselves before the inter-elections.
Since many prominent Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Cavanaugh, after having been charged with several sexual harassment charges, analysts warn that this may give rise to unwelcome reactions in advance of future inter-elections, especially in women.
This situation is surrounded by passion, and most Republicans publicly declare that they would like to move on to voting.
Such things cannot then simply be played back,” stated an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday, by Grant Reger, Professor of Political Science at Maxwell University of Syracuse.
Righer doubted that the FBI investigation that Senator Jeff Flake (respublisher from Arizona) was under pressure at the last minute would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the chief adviser and resource person of the progressive group MoveOn (Keep moving on), Catherine Jean-Perrieu said on Friday, "The women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mick, on Friday morning, protesters sang "Listopad Coming!" during a demonstration at the Juridical Committee, when the Republicans decided to move to Cavanaugh's confirmation despite Dr. Christine Blazey Ford's testimony.
In an interview with Stu Rotenberg's news website, an outside political observer, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"It's said now, and it's true.
However, motivation may increase, especially in the 18-29-year-old female electionists, who have not yet been identified and often do not vote if they don't like the president.”
Even before Ford gave evidence in connection with the charges against the Supreme Court's candidate for a sexual offence, analysts predicted a negative reaction by the voters if the Republics insisted on acquittal.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, the former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, stated, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
In an interview with the news, Director of Priorities USA (groups that help in the democratic campaign) Guy Cecil said, "it's not about voting a committee, voting a final vote, or how Cavanaugh got caught up on the charges, but how they reacted and how they acted."
However, Americans' thoughts about whether they believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, are divided, and Ford has a little more support.
According to a new YouTube survey, 41 percent of respondents believe or are more likely to believe in Ford’s testimony, while Cavanaugh’s testimony either believes or is more likely to believe 35 percent of the respondents.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that they thought Cavanaugh was giving or was giving false testimony, whereas 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after Flack's insistence, the FBI is checking the charges against Ford and another borrower, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Juridical Committee about how Cavanaugh attacked her while in a state of alcohol abuse when she was 17.
Ramírez stated that the candidate for the position of judge of the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at a party during their studies at the University of Jella in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a "new Internet" to create a Google and Facebook competition.
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the global Internet, is launching a new startup to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is developing a platform with an open source Solid, an idea that belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users can choose where to store data and who to access information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the Inrupt target was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
It's a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid technology to enable users to create a "personal online data repository" or POD.
It can store contact lists, lists of current cases, a calendar, an audio library, and other tools for its own use and operation.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify at the same time.
A unique feature of this personal online repository is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities through data."
According to Inrupt Director General John Bruce, the company intends to engage in resources, processes and appropriate skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company is now composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several regular developers hired to work on the project, and a volunteer programmer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own self-contained applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee claimed that he and his team are not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all their business models experience radical changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Media Burners-Lee, Inrupt's mission was "to provide commercial energy and ecosystem and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners-Lee is an influential figure in the debate about online neutrality.
Even during the launch of the Inrupt Berners-Lee, he remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I look very optimistic at the next era of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Commemoration of the Church to the Order of Victoria during World War I
The only representative of the Anglican Church who received the order of the Victoria Cross for participating in the war during World War I is honored in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was rewarded for participating in the Battle of Belnglis and Leocourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper’s bullet four days later and never learned that he had received Britain’s highest military reward.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vanne, called "uniquely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he received the reward.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Colonel Vann transferred his batalion through St. Katen's Canal "through a very dense fog and under a thick fire of field guns and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the fire border, and with the "superious bravery" led the line forward, before that one broke into the field cannon and destroyed three enemy cannons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – a little more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vanne said that his grandfather did something he could never repeat himself and that deserved to be respected.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vanne, laid a crown after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vanne said that "he's going to feel very proud of taking part in this parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the respect that so many people show him."
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they were shown "Peppu Pig."
Imagine that you don't sleep all night just to watch Bellator 206, and you're not allowed to view the main event.
There were 13 battles in the San José tourrs, including six main program titles, which were broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just before Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to get together in a fight, United Kingdom television viewers died of surprise when Pep's pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the fight.
Some spectators were not thrilled because they had not slept until the morning, waiting for battle.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a child's cartoon seemed to him "some kind of bad joke."
"The government's decree of content, which was broadcast at 6:00 a.m., was inappropriate, so they were forced to release a child's broadcast," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and public relations Bellator, when asked for a TV broadcast,
Peppa Pig, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, promised to work on the schedule of broadcasts to cover future audiences in the UK.
"I think that if we talk about repeating the broadcast, we can do it," said Coker.
"On the contrary, it's Sunday, 6:00 a.m., and we can't do anything until we have Sunday and Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages that we responded to, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to eliminate it.
However, it proved to be an incompatibility with government orders.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to shorten the tour to five instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to redirect the signal to fans, but we're still canceling these attempts.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daly’s Olympic jump in the water tells us that he grew, feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete stated that he didn't understand that "not everyone looks like him" until he went to high school.
By participating in the Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he pointed out that he openly spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also claimed that because of his parenthood, he became less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, a longtime host, went to hospital for a few months.
When he came as a couple for Laverne's first program, he said that he felt worse than others in his childhood, because "the society doesn't like boys and girls."
He said, "To this time, the feeling of less cost and difference was exactly what gave me the strength and the strength to succeed."
According to him, he wanted to prove that something was "hard" in order not to disappoint all those who finally learned about his orientation.
The two-fold bronze Olympic Prior became a famous LBHT rights activist and took advantage of the appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke openly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this hope to others.
A three - time champion of the world admitted that his feelings for the man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 were a real surprise to him.
Daley took the Oscar Award winner, the 20 - year - old, last year, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so many things at this young age" (at the first Olympic games he performed at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also survive a similar fall and fall.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and since then, according to Daily, his "world perception" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would only think about what should be gold," he said.
"You know, there are things far more important than the Olympic Gold Medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said that his father couldn't accept the idea of the end, and before dying, he asked him if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him, "you can't sit in the front row because you're no longer around," said Daley.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daly took part in the Olympic Games 2012 and acquired bronze.
"I knew that that was what I had dreamed of my whole life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympic Games, and there was no better feeling than that," said Daley.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song – Proud (Hordy) in the performance of Heather Small – that resonated with him while preparing for the Olympic Games and still summons the ants.
Desert Island Discs is released at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 p.m.
On Saturday, a tournament match for the Ryder Cup led Michelson, who wasn't in uniform.
American Phil Mikkelson set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th tour game for Ryder's Cup, but it has to restore the form so that this event doesn't become a disaster for him.
Michelson, who is a record 12-year tourner, took Captain Jim Furyk out of the game at the time of the forballs and forsams.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner spent the whole day encouraging the team and training on the side, hoping to master the emotions.
Because Michelson was not famous for the appropriate blows, even while he was in the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete was not exactly suitable for a complex golf course, Le Golf National, where the raft usually punishes the swooping punches.
And if the field isn't that hard, on Sunday's ninth match, Michaelson will have to meet the champion of the Open Champion and the master of the exact strike by Francesco Molinari, who, together with the new Tommy Fleetwood, won all his matches this week.
If Americans who are behind three points after 12 single games start well, the Michelson game can be decisive.
Furic expressed confidence in his athlete, and he must have had nothing to add to that.
"He fully understood his role today, spattered on my back, hugged me, and said tomorrow would be ready," said Furic.
"He has no doubt about his powers.
Michelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, which has done so much for the teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I predicted more games, but that's how it worked, so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there in the field, like anyone else."
If Michelson goes out on Saturday, Nick Faldo's record will be broken, who played the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup tournament.
He might be able to complete his career on the "Ryder Cup" tour, which never matched his individual achievements.
Michaelson’s account for 18 victories, 20 defeats, and 7 nights of success, however, Furyk said that his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's a guy who's great at having a team," Furik explained.
"I think the younger players had a good time riding on it, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big break doesn't solve anything.
Thomas Bjorn, a captain of the European team, knows from experience that a marked break in before the single match of the last day for the Ryder Cup is yet to guarantee victory.
Dutchman debuted in 1997 in a game on the field of the Valderram Club, where the team headed with Sev Ballesteros ahead of the Americans by five points, but won the match with a slight break with a score of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in a game at the Walderram field; a big break in the Brookline where we lost, and in the Walderram field where we won," said Bjorn after watching Class 2018 winning games, with a score of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break is 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has yet been resolved.
Tomorrow we have to play with maximum return.
Go out on the field and do whatever you need.
The game will only be finished after the result appears on the table.
We have the goal of acquiring this trophy, and that is what we want.
As I said earlier, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we are well aware of who will stand up to us, the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a complex field, Bjorn added, "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow, things can be different.
They're expecting a personal match tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's cool to play field with a partner when things go well, but just when you're standing there alone, you can check out what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to configure the players to perform tomorrow: at the limit of opportunity.
You leave your partner with no support, and now he has to show you what he's capable of."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number, Jim Furic, expects his partners to play a better game at the individual level, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Up to Furik's very last day, the fate was returned by different sides: he was among the winners in Brookline, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, organized players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, like it was in Brookline and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone else’s side, the players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We've properly positioned the players in the team warehouse, as if we're going to, like, do something incredible tomorrow."
Thomas is charged with trying to lead the counter-attack in the top-match against Rory McElroy, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter are on the top half of the European team list.
"These partners are the ones I chose in this order because I want to share the effort equally throughout the game," so Bjorn commented on his choice of players at individual games.
The introduction of a new German battleship was rescheduled
The most recent German Navy frigate was to be put into operation as early as 2014 instead of old-fashioned battleships during the Cold War; however, according to the local media, this will not happen until at least the following year, because of the malfunctioning systems and the rapid increase in spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, obtained from a spokesman for military knowledge, the entry into operation of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of a series of modern frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery affected the implementation of the ambit project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some technologies to reduce visibility, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is a long period of technical support, and it is expected that new frigates will be able to avoid returning to the base port for about two years.
Journalists Die Zeit warns, however, that owing to the persistent delays, the military ships that were to increase Germany’s military strength in the sea will also become obsolete at the time of their introduction into exploitation.
A large-scale F125 frigate was hit in the headlines of the Toric newspaper when German naval forces officially refused to bring the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a naval ship returned to a shipbuilding company after delivery.
The reasons for the return are little known, but the German media referred to significant “software and equipment defects”, which made the battleship unfit for military operations.
Shortcomings of software are particularly important, as the ship's crew of the Baden-Württemberg class consists of about 120 sailors – only half the number of soldiers who served in the old Fragates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has been found that the vessel has a significant excess weight, which worsens its exploitative characteristics and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
The Rhineland-Palatinate frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7000 tons) for the same class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to malfunctioning equipment, another problem was the cumulative cost of the project, which also includes the cost of preparing the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euro has become a huge 3.1 billion euro (US$ 3.6 billion).
Problems with getting new frigates have gained special weight in the light of recent warnings about the fall of German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, an armed forces band, reported that the Navy of the country “was left with a small number of ships suitable for combat missions”.
The official stated that the situation had deteriorated for some time, since old ships had been out of use and no new ones had arrived.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could fill the Navy.
A National Trust Watches the Secret Life of Bats
A new study that is being carried out on land ownership in Scotland's highlands is intended to determine how bats use the landscape to search for food.
Scientists hope that the data obtained will help to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals so that they can be preserved in the future.
In the gardens of Invery in Wester Ross, scientists from the Scottish National Trust will observe species such as dwarf neopier and pygmee netopy, as well as the ears of a common and watery night.
Special registerors will be placed in strategic locations in the land area to observe the behaviour of the bats during the season.
Workers and volunteers of the Scottish National Trust will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and fitness of bat screams.
Then it's planned to develop a detailed map of animal residence and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their environment.
Rob Dewar, a natural resource person in the Scottish National Waste, hopes that the results of the study will help to determine which areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of measures to care for the environment (e.g. the formation of grasslands) and determine how best to conserve forests for bats and other associated species.
During the last century, bat populations have declined significantly in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened by the active construction and destruction of areas that deprive them of their places of nesting.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, adhesive fly paper, chemical processing of building materials, and attacks on home cats.
The brawls are not actually blind.
However, hunting at night helps their ears to catch prey more effectively than their eyes.
They use a sophisticated sonar technique to detect insects and obstacles to flight trajectory.
In Scotland’s National Spending, which covers over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance, and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, bats are taken seriously.
Ten specially trained experts carry out regular research, screening of nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only Fleet Reservoir in Scotland, which is located in the area of Trev in the area of Dumfris and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland are found.
David Thompson, the manager, says it's an ideal place for them.
"In the area of the Premises, the conditions for the bats are great," he assures us.
"There are old buildings, many giant trees, and other favorable living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot about bats, and with the research we do here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to prosper."
It insists that it is very important to test the territory for the presence of bats before any technical work is carried out, because the unintentional destruction of one nest for the young can kill up to 400 females with babies, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
Scavengers and their nests are protected by law, and animals are prohibited from killing, tormenting, or harassing.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Fleet Conservation Center, urged the public to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats.
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape, and his lawyers prepare a complaint against the German edition
Cristian Ronald called the charges of rape a "smart" and claimed that people were "tried to draw attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are prepared to file a complaint against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published suspect information.
Katrin Majorga, an American woman, accused the forward of the Portuguese collector and the Juventus football club of raping in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel magazine on Friday, Ronaldo was supposed to pay $375,000 to keep quiet.
A few hours after the charges were brought, 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to 142 million of his fans in video transmission to Instagram, calling the respective messages a "smart."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander,” a statement was made against the camera by the Golden Ball's five-time ruler.
"They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to profit from me, but similar situations are part of my job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," added a football player laughing.
According to Reuters Information Agency, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for published charges, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspicion in private life".
The lawyer, Christian Shertz, claimed that a footballer would demand compensation for “the moral damage in size that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious cases of personal rights violations in recent years”.
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronald fell in front of her and said that he was a 99 percent good guy, who was a one percent bad guy.
As documented, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with a model, but that he agreed to it.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital, where she was photographed, but later she agreed to a court order because she was afraid of revenge and was wary of "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous arrangement because she continues to suffer from an incident that she says happened.
At the time of the incident, Ronald was preparing to move to the FC Real Madrid with the FC Manchester United, and this summer he became a player in the Grand Italian football team, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will “everlastingly regret” the loss of automotive workers
The UK will be "long-lasting" if it loses the status of world leader in automobile industry after Brexit, which is warned by the Minister of Economy, Greg Clark.
He added that he was appalled by a statement by Toyota UK representatives who told BBC journalists that in the case of British exit without a deal, the company would be forced to suspend production and work of its factory in Bernaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," assures Secretary Clarke.
The Japanese automotive manufacturer argued that the effects of delays on the border in the case of Brexit without a contract could cost jobs.
The Bernaston factory, which produces Toyota cars of the Auris and Avensis models, released about 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain exits the EU excrucially at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other automotive workers, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain’s exit from the EU will affect without an international trade agreement.
For example, BMW stated that the Mini model factory in Oxford would be shut down a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automotive manufacturers are that Brexit without a deal could cause risks to supply chains.
Toyota's production line functions in the rapid delivery mode of parts and materials according to the needs – details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for the vehicles that are being commissioned.
If, on March 29, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there may be a breakdown in the supply of the details, resulting in delays and a lack of material.
As the company says, the Toyota warehouse can place the details for not more than one day, so the production will have to stop.
Greg Clark pointed out that in the organization's plan for a relationship with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Cheques Plan), "there are also plans to avoid problems on the border."
"We need a deal, and we need to make an optimum deal that I think will not only be able to succeed at the current moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have emerged," he said during the Today program at BBC Radio 4.
"Because of Toyota's testimony as well as that of other automotive workers, we need to preserve the highly effective supply chains."
The Toyota company has not been able to tell how long production will be halted, but in the long run, it is expected that an increase in costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, will cause the contraction of jobs.
Peter Tsovalaris, head of the United Trade Association in the Bernaston Factory, who worked here for 24 years, reported that other participants were extremely concerned: "I can tell from experience that short jobs are not being restored."
A government representative said, "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan to shape our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting can be postponed again, in the White House.
According to White House representatives on Sunday, the responsible meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "repeat for another week" while discussions continue on the nomination of Brett Cavanaugh as a judge of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Müller, who investigates Russia's interference in the election, relations between Trump and Russia's assistants, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For a few months in Washington, D.C., the possibility of releasing the attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence, is being discussed.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had commented on the use of microphones to record talks with Trump and the possibility of ending President's 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday, he visited the White House on the background of reports that an official was about to retire.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump claimed that "wouldn't want" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was set aside to avoid a time-to-date meeting with the Juridical Committee of the Senate, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump arranged to conduct a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh, which added to the vote in the Senate.
Pressecretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, performed on Fox News Sunday.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not set. Maybe it'll be this week, and I expect her to be suspended for another week, in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I keep watching the press have the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not conduct a briefing for the media in the White House since September 10.
The moderator, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that the infrequent conduct of the brilfings was not related to the public game, although she added, "I won't deny that they're playing public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
"The president answers questions more often than any president to him," she said, and added, without referring to the source, "Statistics speaks for itself."
Sanders pointed out that the britings are still going to happen, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States a question, it's better than talking to me."
We're trying to talk to the press a lot, it's supposed to be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the ability to talk to the U.S. President is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when outside the White House, open sessions or press conferences for high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why this is so by speaking to journalists in a strange and sometimes strange way.
The Scottish Secretary of State for Health has sent a letter to EU employees for fear of Brexit.
The Secretary of State for Health sent a letter to citizens of other EU countries working in the Scottish National Health Service to express their appreciation for their work and ask them to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the British withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already assumed the obligation to defray the cost of claiming permanent resettlement status for EU citizens who work in autonomous government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said, "For the long summers, there were talks between the United Kingdom and the EU on the issue of exit, and it's the fall that needs to be decided.
But the British government is intensifying preparations for a possible exit without a treaty.
I know this may be a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I would like to emphasize once again how much I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Associations across the European Union and beyond share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving health services for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, we really want you to stay."
Christion Ebercrombie Transformed Terminal Operation After Head Trauma
The half-back of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Ebercrombie, has undergone a short-term operation after having suffered head injury in a Sunday match against the Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team played with account 31:27. This was reported by a journalist in Tennesseean.
The head coach of Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He came to the side line where he got angry," said Reed.
On the sideline, coaches and medical staff gave Ebercrombie oxygen before taking it back on the load for further testing.
The official representative of Tennessee State Tigers informed Chris Harris from WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie had operated at the University of Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "until there's any evidence of the type and severity of the injury," the Tennessee State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-year student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after he moved from the Illinois team.
He did five captures of the ball on Sunday before he got out of the game, so he's got 18 intercepts in the season.

The higher government tax will be drawn from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Ministry of Finance expects an additional 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
As Teresa May announced today, foreigners who buy non-moving in Britain will pay more tomatoes, and extra money will be spent to help the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremiah Corbin’s efforts to involve young voters in promises of more affordable housing targeted at highly paid workers.
The raising of the tax will involve physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the government will provide additional funds to help those who are forced to sleep in the open sky.
An additional token, followed by an increase in the prehistoric age for the second dwelling and the non-moving of rent, may be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects an additional 120 million pounds per year.
According to estimates by specialists, 13% of the new immobility that is being built in London falls into the property of foreign citizens, which increases prices and complicates tasks for those who just dream about their own housing.
Many rich parts of the country, especially in the capital, are deserted, as large numbers of foreign buyers live most of the time outside the country.
The new plan of action only appeared a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lowering of the State to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for immobility by buying land without further use, and he urged Theresa May to give up the quota for affordable immobility in order to correct the "smart position on the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of important reforms in the area of non-rotation, such as the control of rents and the impossibility of dispersal without good reason.
He also proposes to expand the authority of the local council in the construction of a new home.
Theresa Mei said, "Toric promised that I would dedicate my premiere to the restoration of the British dream -- for every new generation of life should be better.
This requires changes in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always remain open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, the fact that individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens cannot be said to be fair.
For too many people, the dream of their own housing has become unattainable, and the problem of living in the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "More than anything, I want to be the chief coach of the Scottish Congregation."
Chief coach of the FC Sanderland, Jack Ross, claims that "the greatest desire" is to lead Scotland's collection ever.
A 42-year-old Scotsman went to rebuild the club from the northeast of the country, which is now ranked third in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to Stadium of Light this summer, returning the last season of the FC "St. Mirren" to the Scottish Premier League.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to the second collection in Scotland, but that's all over," Ross told me during the Sportsout program at the BBC Scottland radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of the collective Scotland at Hampden Park Stadium." That always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to be successful as head coach of the club."
Ross' predecessors at the FC Sanderland included Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Ellardays, Martin O'Neill, Roy King, Gustavo Poetus and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach of FC "Alla Atletique" claims that he didn't feel agitated about going to a big club following such authoritative names, rejecting offers from FC "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"In the current phase, I think I've succeeded if the club returns to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and its material and technical support, this club is no doubt equal to the Première League,” he noted.
"It's not going to be an easy task, but the other result I don't think is going to be a success."
Ross has only been building a coach's career for three years before he was the second coach at the FC Dumbarton, and spent 15 months at the FC coaching headquarters at the Garths.
And then he helped "Hello" out after the FC got to the third division, and the next season from "St. Merren" went from the run-off to the title of winners of the first division.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his FC game career at Clyde, Gartlpool, Folkerk, St. Merren, and Hamilton Academy.
"I'm at a crossroads," he mentions, referring to the transition to the FC "Hello."
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more appropriate to me than playing.
That sounds strange, because I've been successful, I've earned a lot of money, and I've reached some heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are many challenges that we have to cope with every week.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as a head coach, I feel right in my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt more comfortable in my adult life than since I chose this profession."

Study: 5:30 a.m. Sunday is the perfect time for a beer kitchen.
The summer heat has helped to increase the revenue of British pubs, which are not in the best of times, but have increased the pressure on the restaurant network.
According to estimates, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while the profits of restaurants declined by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of CGA, a business counsellor, said, "Because of the sun's weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup, July went through the same pattern as the previous month, when the price of the pubs grew by 2.8 per cent, and restaurants went even worse.
The red fall by 1.8 percent in July increased.
Pubs and bars focused on drinking so far have the best scores – increasing their profits is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
Pubs with food also suffered from heat, but not as much as restaurants.
Visitors seem to be interested in drinks only.
In controlled pubs and bars, the sale of drinks in a month increased by 6.6 per cent, and the sale of food decreased by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, an analyst of the Free and Hotel Department of RSM, said, "The same trends we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and large - scale social or sports events remain major factors affecting sales on the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, groups of restaurants continue to lose their profits. An annual decline of 4.8% in sales causes special concern over the need to reduce costs.
A long hot summer came at a bad time for catering facilities, and we'll see if the moderate temperature we've seen in August can give them the necessary rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowing down of new brands.
The galouse indicator of the volume of sales of the Coffee Peach Tracker in the British pubs, bars and restaurants is a reflection of the collected and analysed performance of 47 working groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds sterling. This is a generally accepted industry standard.
Every fifth child has a hidden social media account.
Research has shown that one in five children, sometimes under 11 years of age, has an account hidden from parents and teachers on social networks.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of falsified pages in Instagram
This news has increased concerns about possible sexual placement
20 per cent of the students reported having a "primary account" shown to their parents.
Every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years of age, creates a social media account that hides from adults.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of false pages in Instagram, a social network for the exchange of photographs.
This news has increased concerns about possible sexual placement.
20 per cent of the students were told that they had a clean “primary” account that was shown to their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
Mother, who accidentally came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a call for "rape me."
Research by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools revealed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social network profiles. Half of these children admitted that the additional account is secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC Association, said, "We're very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel that they want to create an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Aide Doyle will become "athletic interests" in Scotty Athletics.
Aide Doyle was elected to the Scotty Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general board of board members.
Doyle is a well-established Scottish athletic, and the head of Yen Beatty's council called this a great opportunity for those who lead the sporting movement to take advantage of its extensive experience gained at the international level over the past decade.
"Eylid enjoys great respect among the athletes of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that, by joining the council, the athletic sport in Scotland will be of great benefit," Beatty's assurance.
Doyle said, "Inspired to be an athlete, I hope I can really benefit and promote sports in Scotland."
The American, a four-time Olympic champion who won 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games, and now a BBC sports tourner, lost the opportunity to go through a transitor ischemic attack.
He wrote in Twitter, "That's when I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if and how much I could recover.
As a result of my tremendous efforts, I have been able to recover completely, and I have learned to walk again, and I am doing dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for your words of support!"
In advertising, women's milk-suckers were compared to cows – Internet users' thoughts split.
The milk-sucker manufacturer faced a mixed reaction from the Internet users to an ad that compares young mothers to active cows.
To mark the release of a product called the world's first quiet milk-sucker, Elvie's consumer engineering company published an ad in a humorist music video style to demonstrate the freedom that a new sucker provides for mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a blue-filled cinnamon under a song that says, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail," and "If you see it yourself, it's not a bleach, it's my chest."
Then the choir sings, "Suck it, suck it up to feed the kids, suck it, suck it off so you don't waste milk."
However, a commercial published on the Facebook company’s website has generated a turbulent discussion online.
The video has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the reaction of the Internet users has been mixed, and many have noted that the advertising has underestimated the “horrible organization” of milk production in the industry.
"It's not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their kids are being taken away from them a few days after birth,” wrote one of the users.
Elvie's milksucker can easily be hidden in a feeding bra (Elvie/Moother)
Here's another comment: "It's obvious that it's traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not engage them in advertising a milk-sucker for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone added, "These ads are far from reality."
Other users have been advocating for a commercial, and one of the women in the videos was "so much fun."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would certainly have bought something like that if I were still breast - feeding.
Sucking milk made me feel really like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I did not look for hidden content in it.
It's a wonderful product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "A funny commercial directed at moms who suck milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This ad is not intended to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women display milksuckers hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, Elvie's suction is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes, and easily hides in a feeding bra, so women can move freely, keep their children, and even walk out the street.
Ana Balarin, a partner and creative executive director of Mother's Advertising Agency, commented on this situation: "The Elvie Smoke Smoke is so revolutionary that it requires a bright and provocative presentation.
After sharing a parallel between women who cure milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the particulars of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way, showing the incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker would bring.
It's not the first time that the Elvie Sucker gets into the news headers.
As part of the Week of Fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on a showcase with this product during a show of clothing from modeler Martha Yakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent town on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively constant, partly because strict rhetoric and policy by Trump administration has complicated the process of placing children in caretakers.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers were the immigrants themselves who did not have the documents, and now they are afraid to put their own opportunity to stay in the country at risk, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their homes would be required to print their fingerprints and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official of the Bureau of Immigration and Tax Control, testified before the Congress that the Bureau's colleagues had arrested dozens of people who applied for juvenile care without accompanying them.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Around 80% of the people who are caregivers or members of their homes are in the country illegally, many of whom are foreigners who have committed offences.
So we continue to persecute these people,” Mr. Albins pointed out.
According to the shelter workers, in order to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of the children to appear in court within a month after being detained, not 60 days later, as they used to be.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing instead of coming to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to receive shelter as a result of a court decision will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and official data from responsible officials in the last months, the longer the children remain in the care of, the greater the likelihood that they will experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or escape.
Legal defenders argue that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor children’s psychological condition.
They added that by moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to friends, we risk increasing the trauma that many of them have suffered.
Syria ordered the United States, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw their forces.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been in war for eight years.
Moualem, who also works as a deputy prime minister, claimed that foreign forces had been on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so “the attitude towards them will be appropriate”.
"They have to go immediately and not make a deal," he said at the assembly.
Mu'alem insisted that "war against terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He claimed that Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The U.S. has deployed some 2,000 military officers in Syria, mostly teaching and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France sent over 1,000 soldiers to a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Mu'alem assured us that the country had created the right conditions for their return, and he also accused the "some Western countries" of "proliferating unsubstantiated fears" that prevented the refugees from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help people return," he said.
"We observe an attempt to politicize a humanitarian problem."
The US and the European Union warn that they will not help Syria rebuild countries until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of war has been made.
United Nations Diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlibu, the last large rebel cover, has paved the way for the continuation of political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by Syrian forces supported by Russia into a province of three million people.
However, Mu'alem emphasized that the agreement had “smart terms” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including Al-Qaida-related fighters, who would be “destroyed.”
UN-Embassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee that will include government representatives and opposition to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Moualem made arrangements for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, claiming that his work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and cautioned against intervention.
Why Trump Will Be Reconfigured
According to this logic, Trump can be reconfigured in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, he does not have the authority to follow scandal and impeachment.
No doubt it would have been the most dramatic conclusion of the presidency in all time!
At the moment, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and has actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Madow Show on the MSNBC cable channel peaked at 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news was discussed.
"This is the fire that attracts people because it's beyond our comprehension," said Neil Bere, the producer of the last candidate drama on ABC's channel about the Secretary of State, who becomes president after the devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovell, an experienced humorist writer and author of the book "The Less Funny Moments: As well as a few hard truths about entering the Hollywood men's club," offers another theory.
She remembered a trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's making me laugh," he said.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington can determine the future of Rowe's case against Wade, the possibility of reuniting immigrant families, and the state of the world economy.
Avoidance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you're watching a group of experts talk about Bob Woodward's use of "good-known" sources for his book The Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 strut skin jacket, and the effects of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy published by Storm Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the former.
"The sense of reality shows is partly related to the fact that you are consummated every night with something new," remarked Brent Montgomery, CEO of Weelhouse Entertainment, and author of the TV program "The Pawnbard Stars", about rotating in the acting unit and the daily plotting of the "Trump" show (a conflict from NFL, supported by Kim Chen In).
If you allow yourself to miss one episode, you can be hopelessly left behind.
When I was able to meet Mr. Flace this week at his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai, there was the heat of sunlight (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not when Brett Cavanaugh appeared before the Senate Juridical Committee, but the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the hair.
"I remember how we used to create all those crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I took it as a joke, but it seems they were right."

External Infusions of the Hardest Intermediate Elections in Congress
Not surprisingly, in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, there are additional money injections, as two of the right congressmen are running for a chair.
This parish region of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, is fought by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives, Conor Lemb, who won a victory in another district in an additional election last spring.
Lemb opposes another valid congressman, Republican Kit Roths, who now represents the 12th district of the state of Pennsylvania, whose borders are much the same as the 17th.
The maps were reworked after the Pennsilvania Supreme Court in January approved the decision that the old boundaries of the districts had been framed for the benefit of the Republicans, contrary to the Constitution.
The pre-electoral race in the new 17th district caused severe opposition between the financial subdivisions of the main parties, the United States Democratic Party Committee for Congress Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NCCC).
The name Lemba became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning with a minimal advantage in the 18th district during the additional elections at the Congress in March, which were widely publicized.
President Donald Trump won a 20-point victory in this area.
Political experts gave little preference to the Democrats.
In the United States, we considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for support of China, but we changed our mind.
Diplomats recalled Washington’s weak opposition to the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump had a warm meeting with President Panami, Juan Carlos Varela, before Trump had a hotel in Panama, until his partners removed the staff hired by Trump Organization.
Officials of the State Department decided to recall the leaders of the diplomatic missions of the United States of America from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions on non-removal of Taiwan”, announced the press secretary of the department, Heather Neuert, earlier this month.
But the sanctions were dealt with only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid in 2017, particularly in drug control and in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included shortening financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this country of Central America, with its high unemployment and murder rates.
According to the results of the internal council of the North and Central American states, the conference was postponed at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, and followed last year as a step forward in efforts to control the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by the middle of September, high-ranking representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and in fact, that's where the question of sanctions against El Salvador stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence is now planning to speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October to indicate that the administration considers this to be a very important event.
At the same time, three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, since there were no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s representative at the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, on conditions of anonymity.
The information they provided was confirmed by an external analyst close to administration, who also spoke on anonymous terms.
Learn History
The next discontent may be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Müller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which is a powerful confirmation of why it can be found in the public information now available.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is reported to be checking the possible link between Trump's campaign and the attack on our voting system from Russia.
If Congress’s influence moves into other hands, Trump will have to report to the congressmen, just as he does to the electionists and eventually to the same party.
There's a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't want to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as are his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to set up a coup against Hitler if only the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is defined by such crucial moments, and the uncontrollable movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a number of such moments.
What are we going to do if Trump fires A.D.A. Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Müller's fate depends?
Rosenstein was in trouble when this newspaper reported that he offered to record conversations secretly with the president and shared his thoughts on Trump's incompatibility with the position.
Rosenstein called information in The Times inaccurate.
"How will we react if the investigation of the case against Brett Cavanaugh, which recently started the FBI, is not sufficiently thorough or honest, or if Cavanaugh's candidacy is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, will we, in the medium term, vote for those members of the Congress who will be able to hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these trials, it will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech - speaking Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light up Saturday candles on the swastika table.
With such an inheritance, can I not look with optimism into the future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is looking forward to meeting the Vienna Rapid.
The FC Rangers accepts the Rapid on Thursday, and after an astonishing fact in Spain in a game with Villarreal early this month, winning the Austrians will give the Scottish Club a good chance of getting out of Group G of the European League.
Because of the injury to the knee, Graham Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a match with the Villarreal, which ended with a score of 2:2, however, he believes that the FC Rangers can use this result as a swing to achieve more.
"It was a good result for us, because "Villarreal" is a strong team," the 31-year-old player noted.
"We went out to play with the hope of getting something and got one point.
At the end of the game, we may be able to move forward, but nothing in general is likely to be a fair result.
In the first half, the opponent was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation for our own good.
On Thursday, there will be another important opposition in the European League.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not going to be easy. Our future rivals have shown good results in their last game, but we can count on the support of the batterers, and I'm sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was certainly hard, starting with my injuries and ending up with the changes in the club itself, but now the situation is normal.
We have a great setup, and all the boys are satisfied.
I hope we can move on, leave behind last season and succeed."
Women Lost Sleep for Pension Saving Fear
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few people spoke to their family about it.
About half of the people who were involved in the Nationalwide study said that they were talking to their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% of the interviewees talked to the kids about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't rush to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide subdivision on life insurance.
That's where we start.
Talk to your husband or wife and your children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need if you do not communicate your wishes to your relatives in advance.
Consult with your counselor and your family to determine where and how to take care of them, because this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Use a financial consultant to advise on how to cover the costs involved.
The sources of long - term care financing include the traditional insurance policy, the hybrid life - insurance policy, or self - support at the expense of your own money (as long as you have money).
Carefully prepare legal documents, which will help to avoid legal tracts in advance.
Prepare trust for your representative, who will control your medical care and ensure that experts do what you want if you cannot do it personally.
In addition, we recommend that trust in money be formalized.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills if you fail.
Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs immediate medical attention, so he is taken to the hospital.

In Ilfracoum, a man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle when he returned home from a party.
A 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracoum, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
The officers described the shooting that took place at 02:30 in British summertime as "accident."
The victim did not see the assailant.
His wounds do not pose a threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reported by government officials, but the number of casualties could increase.
Because of the break-up of communications, the officials involved in humanitarian assistance are unable to obtain any information from the Regentship of Dongal, a region north of Pale, which is nearer to the earthquake epicentre with a magnetic score of 7.5 points.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala.
Let us give a few basic facts about the city of Palu and the Regentship of the Dongal island of Sulawesi.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
When the earthquake caused by the tsunami occurred, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regential that stretches more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
According to the data for 2017, there are approximately 299,200 people living in the administrative region in the lower part of the province.
Fishing and farming are the main economics of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel production is also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morvala, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian agency for mitigating the effects of natural disasters in the past 100 years, Pala and Dongala have suffered from tsunamis several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people died as a result of tsunamis in Dongal and hundreds of houses were destroyed.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of the Dongala, and then nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismic Pacific fire ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
The following are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, located in northern Sumatra, caused tsunamis that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in Aceg.
2005: At the end of March, early in April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnetic earthquake of 6.8 points struck the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and caused tsunamis to hit the south coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: A magnetic earthquake of 7.6 points was observed near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 points struck one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing some 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Regentship of Subjaya in the province of Aceg, causing destruction and panic because people have not yet forgotten the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, there were no tsunamis, but over 100 people died under the rubble of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless houses, and thousands of tourists were unable to leave the island immediately.
Sarah Palin, the oldest son, was arrested for domestic violence
The track of Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and Vice President Sarah Palin's candidate, was arrested for assault.
According to a Saturday report from the state of Alaska, 29-year-old Palin of Wasilly, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing a report of violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman I knew tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took away her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is on guard in the Matanusca-Situne insulation unit with a 500-dollar bill.
He went to court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when he was asked if he confessed his guilt, and was reported online.
Palina is charged with three offences against class A, which presuppose arrest for a term of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with class B misconduct, which is punishable by a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is now before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as with obstructing the report of domestic violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol abuse when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for justifying her son’s cruel behavior by post - traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused tsunamis — hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawes on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 gallons caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communications and power grids have come out, and the number of victims can increase in the nearest days.
The earthquake took place near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The video, which is spreading on social networks, shows the moment when the natural disaster hits.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami landed.
Federal accusers demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City.
In New York City, federal accusers demand the death penalty of Syfullo Sayipov, a suspected terrorist in New York City, which resulted in eight deaths – a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
In October, the 30-year-old Sayipov, who was hired at Home Depot, was said to have taken a bicycle ride along the West Side Highway, Lower Manhattan, and began to beat the cyclists and pedestrians he encountered on his way.
In response to a report of the intention to commit execution in the south of the state of New York to justify the death penalty, the accusers must prove that the Saïves "wrongly" killed eight people and "deliberately" caused serious bodily harm.
According to the judicial records, each of these counts of the charge foresees the possibility of capital punishment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Jury Court charged Syipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of demanding that the federal accusers usually press charges for organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of vehicles.
According to the accusers who described the crime committed by Saïp as “serious, cruel and malicious”, this attack is the result of “serious planning and premeditated thinking.”
The victims to whom Syfulla Habibullahevich Saipov inflicted injuries, harmed or killed were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Laura Decadadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferrouche, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnocco, as described in the message of intent.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since, in the South District of New York, the last time a criminal case was committed, which is punishable by death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers, and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the death penalty for a federal case was carried out in New York in 1953, and the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov’s judicial records, Uzbekistan’s native did not show remorse the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he did not regret what he had done.
According to Sayipov’s accustomed act, he informed the authorities that he had been inspired to launch an attack on video IDIL that he was watching on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang the IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sayipov, said that they were "extremely disappointed" by the procuratura's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and sentencing life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only increase the psychological trauma that these events have caused for all the victims," said Patton.
Sayipov’s defense party had also previously asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
Parliamentarian of the Conservative Party believes that NYJEL FARAJA should be appointed as the negotiator of Brexit.
Today, during a protest at the Conservative Party meeting, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the national army."
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party stated that politicians should “hear the pressure” of the Europeans because one of the members of Parliament, Theresa Mae, had proposed his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bone, stated on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "have come" if Mr. Faraj were Secretary of Brexit.
Mae’s attention to the problems she faced in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks was even more attracted by the fact that deputies from the Conservative Party, who opposed the exit, joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying to implement the Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those who oppose the exit, and the EU.
The allies insist that she will not stop trying to negotiate with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and will force the Europeans and Labourers to choose between what she offers and "chaos."
At a Leave Means Leave rally in Solikal, Mr. Bone stated that he wanted to "retaliate from the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Faraj step out of the shadows and take responsibility for the talks with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out," he said.
MP Wellingborough added, "I'll support Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We did not fight in world wars to subjugate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that after the vote in 2016, public opinion changed: "The idea that the British changed their minds and did not want to come out is completely untrue."
A member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit, Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to reporters, "I'm just saying, "Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not backed by our party and our activists, who actually walk on the streets and fight for the votes of the voters.
Please throw away the Chequers and start listening."
In her address to Theresa May, she added, "The Prime Minister keeps his position when they fulfill their promises."
Mr. Faraj stated that politicians should “recognize pressure” if they were to reject the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a question of trust between us, people, and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them they won't get away with it."
In a report to a enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, who plans to betray Brexit, to feel pressure.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-conscious, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the opponents of the exit went through Birmingham and then held a two - hour rally in the center of the city.
A number of activists waved "Conservatives against Brexit" banners after the group was launched in these weekends.
Labour Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives because security problems had arisen since the opening of the conference through their party program.
"These people are telling us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "think seriously" about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after her November election, she would “think seriously about running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the general meetings in West Massachusetts, a representative of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, runs for a second term in November against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Diel, who was a co-head of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is viewed as the main candidate that could fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, her 36th meeting with the general assembly voters since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to participate in the presidential election.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up the government, and for that to happen, there must be a woman in his head."
Arrested a suspected murderer with a firearm from a basketball player, LSU Tigers, Sims.
At Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, on Saturday, it was reported that Wade Sims' suspect was arrested on Friday, with a firearm from a basketball player named LSU Tigers.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. in the east.
On Friday, they published a video shooter with a request to help identify the person on it.
A 20-year-old Simms was shot at Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head and died as a result," stated 247sports police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun and shooting at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Police Department.
Simms, whose height was 6 feet and 6 inches, and who performed in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge, and he played 32 games with 10 stars in the last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes in the field, 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Grand First Russia: Lewis Hamilton shortened the race for the world championship after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettel.
From the time that Walthery Bottas left Lewis Hamilton behind on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’ command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas got a good start from a poul-post and almost beat Hamilton, who tried to hold his position at the first two turns and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to the PET stop first and left Hamilton on the tray in the tail of the race, which was supposed to solve everything.
The Mercedes crew pilot drove another circle and went out behind Fettel, but Hamilton broke into leadership after a certain wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre, as a result of which Ferrari's driver reluctantly left the interior space because of the risk that he would be pressed after the double manoeuvre managed to get forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstoppen started from the back row of the net and remained in seventh place until the end of the first circle.
Then he led most of the race, as he did not change the tires to get to the finishing point quickly and move Kimy Rykkonen out of fourth place.
In sum, he stopped at the 44th lap, but couldn't increase the pace at the last eight, so Rykkonen sat down fourth.
"It's a tough day, because Valttery was full on all weekends and was noble when he gave me the opportunity to pass.
The team did an exceptional job to sit first and second place,” said Hamilton.
The Language of the Body Was Not Impressed
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein for her firm position that she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christine Blazey Ford, who accused a candidate before the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh of sexual violence.
During a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not address directly the presentation given by Ford to the Senate Juridical Committee, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which he said had demonstrated human “subordination, impropriety and lying.”
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that's been happening in the Senate for the last few days, is anger, you see evil people showing vileness, vileness, and lying," he said.
"You're looking at the publications and the information they've given, and then they're like, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you share the information?
Recall her answer... did you announce the contents of the documents? — “What?
Oh, no.
I did not disclose it."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Feinstein received a letter with a detailed statement of charges against Ford against Cavanaugh, and in early September, his contents were released, but Finestein denied that the information leaked in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't disclose the information I received from her," said the Financial Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn't break my promise."
But her denial seemed to displease the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting, "I'll tell you, her body language wasn't astonishing at all.
She may not have done it, but I've never seen anyone hold on to it."
Continuing to defend a candidate to the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual violence by three women, the President assumed that the Democrats were using charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power in any way necessary.
You see abhorrentness, abhorrentness, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to go through to gain power and control,” Mediaite quotes the president's words.
Elite League: Dundy Stars -- Belfast Jayants, 5:3
Jayants player Patrick Dwyer dropped two pucks in a match against Dundee.
The Dundy Stars rehabed for a five-day defeat in the elbow from Belfast Jayants, winning a 5-3 match and report on Saturday.
The Jayants gained an early advantage of two pucks, thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boville.
Mike Sallivan and Jordan Coney levelled the score in the home game, and then Dwyer redirected the Jayants.
The Dandy player, François Bouchard, compared the score, and the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen secured their victory.
This is the third defeat season of the Elite League team, Adam Keith, who won a free victory over Dundee with a score of 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season, and three previous matches were won by the Giants.
Dwyer dropped the first puck for the fourth minute (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall McFall, and four minutes later, Boville, who received the puck from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period of fourteen minutes (13:10), Sullivan returned the landlords to the game, and at sixteen minutes (15:16), Coney, after receiving a puck from Matt Markwardt, compared the score.
Dwyer secured the favor of the Jayants before the first break, throwing his second puck at the end of the first period.
The owners of the fields were regrouped, and Bouchard, at the twenty-eighth minute (27:37), rebalanced the score by throwing a puck when his team was in number.
Thanks to the efforts of Coney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen, at the end of the second period, for the first time brought Dundee forward and secured the victory of his team in the last five-half period.
On Friday, the Jayants team, which has already lost four of the last five matches, will play a race against Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on a plane could avoid an earthquake.
The flight controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he had helped to fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his life.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after a severe earthquake that caused tsunamis on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong underground surges continue to shake the area, and many people are trapped in rubbles in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agun refused to leave his post in a very dispersed tower at the airport of Muthiar SIS Al-Juffri in Pala.
He stayed there to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, who was on the landing line at the time, was safely airlifted.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought it was going down.
He later died in the hospital.
Johns Syrite, a representative of the Indonesian Aeronautical Provider Company, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter from Blikpapan to Kalimantan, who is to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of casualties can reach thousands, because the mitigation agency of the country's natural disasters claims that access to the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is restricted.
"The number of victims can increase because many bodies are still under the rubble, and many of them cannot be reached," said a representative of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves of six meters have devastated the city of Pala, where mass graves will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes deliver aid and food.
Lisa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute, quick help brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water.
Minnies are everywhere looted."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helmand, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help the people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they're going to find.
It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
President Joko Viodo of Indonesia arrived in Pale on Sunday and asked the country's military officials, "I ask all of you to work day and night to perform all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Early this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on the island of Lombok, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: As Air Niugini reported, after the plane fell into the lagoon, one man disappeared without news
The airline that was flying the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one person has disappeared, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated that it was impossible to find a single passenger on Saturday day.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a husband and are working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to do so.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane fell on the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men had been taken to hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and they were all stable.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane landed in a lagoon near the landing lane.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has flown into the landing lane.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was very low above the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told me that he and others were able to get to the crash exits on a thin plane by the belt of the water.
He told us that the stewardess were panicking and shouting and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that seafarers who were working near the modernisation of the dock also helped in rescue operations, bringing people to shore by using an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the last two decades in plane crashes associated with registered PNG airlines, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst restored the chronology of the night on which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution took a stand against a man who was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rawlett, an analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, gave testimony as an expert in the field of operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used the mobile phone records to play the movement of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the murder.
Roulette, according to The Clary Ledger, told that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in the city.
When the accusers asked if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said he was in the Sanford picapi that night, Sanford said that he was "blowing, because my pickap was in Nashville."
Another incompatibility was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulette told me that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he had removed text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers’ phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Gail said.
The defense must present its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop-poppers want to challenge a negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – political ideas and struggles to solve social problems have gone away.
They want to go back to the outskirts and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugues and the Common have recently witnessed the revival of this direction in the United Kingdom thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
In New York, the nanny filed a couple for release, receiving a "racist" message.
In New York, the nanny filed a couple for discriminating release after she received an incorrectly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was another black girl.
The marriage denies that they're racid, comparing the claim to "beating."
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who had come on her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Ms. Maurice twice.
As reported by New York Post, while acknowledging her mistake, Mrs. Plaxson-Flaxman felt "inconvenient" and released Ms. Maurice, she claimed that their previous nanny, who was African-American, was not doing her job well and that instead she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day of work, and then sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple, hoping to get a payback in the amount that she would have received in six months of living with the couple she was initially hired for, although without a contract, she would have paid $350 a day.
"I want to show them that you don't have to do this," she said, "and she added, "and I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they would be racist, the couple claimed that it was a wise decision to release Maurice because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they were offended.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not going to be racist," said her husband Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with a man you've been rude to, even if it wasn't intentional?
Your baby?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Comparing the challenge with "beating," Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months ago and had "not yet taken care of."
"Would you have avenged someone after that?
It's a bad move," added an investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly convicted the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
According to the new letter, Padington’s publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear who could speak
The daughter of Bonda Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to print, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the position of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the tremendous success that Padington's story has made."
Telling that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before a little toy bear inspired him to write a child's book, was optimistic that his work had been rejected, she shared, as on the 60th anniversary of the book's release, at the same time, she felt "rejoicing and sadness" because his father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was a rather modest man and he didn't like to brag," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child!
I think he looked at Padington's success exactly like that.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the 2th Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
"It was a regular phone call, saying it was really bad, that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"And then over there called me and said that she would die for the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The doctors gave her medicine to keep her heart beating, and she gradually stopped acting and left her body.
She died a while before everything was shut off.
I should have just sat there and waited, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn't stifle, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to really hold myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who had suffered from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, ignoring the severe trials she had had to endure.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I put my head down and couldn't stop crying.
It was difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deep compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Gamfries leave cards on the Wallian bridge with telephone numbers that people can call for support, as well as messages to inspire them.
Mrs. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he killed himself.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as I do every day," she said.
The 45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in linde, told her that her son was a promising chef with a nice smile.
"Everyone knew him for smiling.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter."
But he quit his job before he died, because he was "a word in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother’s body after he killed himself.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always afraid it'll have consequences."
Ms. Davis made the cards, so people knew there were people they could turn to and talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Don't shut yourself down, you have to talk."
Ms. Gamfries, who had been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her 15 - year - old husband, Mark, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed, that he was depressed or depressed," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas Day, he was completely discouraged, and when the children opened their presents, he didn't look into their eyes or anything.
She told me that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to survive it, "It caused a devastating
I'm going to the family.
But we have to keep on living and fighting."

The future of Brett Cavanaugh is hanging in the hair: the FBI is starting an investigation.
"I thought that if we could get what we asked for -- limited in the time and nature of the investigation -- we might have reached some agreement," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, and added that he feared that the committee was "breaking up" in the background of a desperate loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his lobbyists want the FBI investigating?
Their resentment is related to time.
The mid-term elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6, if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously complicate their attempts to hold their own people in the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators asking to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush's reign, and by which he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, voting will take place.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes at the Senate sitting, allowing Vice-President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and to approve his candidacy as a judge of the Supreme Court.
During Kim's reign, the number of North Korean crossovers "have"
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of transients from North Korea to South Korea was reduced, according to the South Korean legislator.
Park Pion Seug, referring to the data of the Ministry of the United Republic of South Korea, stated that the number of offenders in the past year was 1,127 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the key factors were the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, and that smugglers carrying illegals now demanded more money.
In Pyongyang, they refrained from public comments.
The majority of North Koreans are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans were reported to have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats transients as illegal migrants, not refugees, and is often forced to rehearse them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally in a state of war, has improved markedly in the last months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issue of denuclearization, the negotiations of which were stalled.
This took place after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen In in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yon-Ho, in the background of the approved sanctions, accused the US of not making progress since then.
“With no confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no one-sided disarmament language,” said Ri Yon-Ho in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "historical" and says he's not fit for the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the post of Justice of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, “historical” and stated that he was at the same time not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've been thinking all along that if a woman ever acted like this, she'd be called "historical," "Pelosi commented on her reaction to Kavano's testimony before the Senate Juridical Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Cavanaugh acted very emotionally, sometimes almost screamed and coughed up, discussing his family and school years.
He also publicly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him an “absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation”, organized by the liberals, who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
According to Pelosi, Cavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as it showed his bias toward the Democrats.
"I think that with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will take his own candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was furious when asked if she would try to declare Cavanaugh's impeachment if his guilt was confirmed, and whether the Democrats would receive the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he works now," said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is now serving as a judge of the United States Court of Appeal in the district of Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions against the Accessible Medical Care Act or the Row v. Wade case, because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the question of confirmation at Cavanaugh’s office, he went to the side of the question whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, biased person and we will say how wonderful that is," said Pelosi.
Women must possess this weapon.
These are just words that contained months and years of anger, and she could not utter them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," she said to me 45 years later, Miss Steinem.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "One woman who was working as an executive director somewhere, and she really helped me, said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had her own technique, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to her fellowman, "You can think that I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
And I am evil."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are considered to be a permissible way out of anger, partly because they are perceived differently.
One of my most obvious memories of my first job in the office, where men were mostly employed, was a situation where one day I cried out of inexplicable anger, and an older woman, an unkind manager that I had always feared, grabbed me by my cell and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to get to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught out of wedlock on board a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, the deeply disappointed Ms. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate was the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation "Smallfoot and Seven Dwarves."
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in the fundraiser, so she made a promise that she would not take part in the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret the support of men for $1,000, had only given her $250.
"They think I'm going to get a cut?" she wondered.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not hold an official campaign, she was emboldened – thanks to the people who supported her, disillusionment with the system, which made the collection of money very difficult, and forced her to be less targeted than the members of the House of Deputies, as well as the anger of sexism, and she was ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," says Ms. Schrader, "the press response.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
Did I think about what they would write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How a US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the US-China trade war were desperate, and, although far before its conclusion, Beijing can benefit from long-term differences.
President Donald Trump of the United States made the first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
This week’s biggest situation has been the new tariffs on products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), which actually tax half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Peckin paid back with the same coin every time, recently putting a tomato in the size of five to ten percent on American goods for a sum of $60 billion.
China has committed itself to similar US measures, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to miss the opportunity to live up to that promise in the near future.
Making Washington retreat means accepting the demands, but for China’s president, Xi Jingpin, the US’s public worship is too shameful.
However, experts believe that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure in the US trade war can give China a long-term perspective, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic fall in any country, and this actually poses a greater threat than observers have previously admitted," said an analyst, Abigail Grace, who deals with Asian-related issues at the Center for New American Security.
The Foreign Minister stated that Syria was “prepared” for the return of the refugees.
In Syria, it is claimed that they are ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and are seeking help in rebuilding a country devastated by war that lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"The real situation today has become more stable and safer because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the terrorized neighbourhoods so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have been forced to abandon because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and limited their means of subsistence.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to accept assistance in rebuilding a war-torn country.
But he emphasized that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the riot.
Europe holds the victory for the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team conquered the Ryder Cup in 2018, when the U.S. team won with a sum of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time since 1993 and has not won the Cup of Ryder tour.
Europe returned the crown when a team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the victory over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikkelson, who worked hard for most of the tour, hit his first long-distance strike on the 16th hole of steam-3 into the water and passed over to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever gone through the 5-0-0 account since the start of the tour in the modern form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit has been defeated with a score of 5:4 from the lowest-rated player in the European Turbierne Olesen team in Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world ratings, gave up his 2:1 account to Jan Polter of England, who may have been in the final tour of the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish man Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Kubka Ryder, who had already taken part in the tour eight times, became a European who had won most of the tournaments all along, bringing 25.5 points to his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, so happy to return the cup.
It's a team's credit, and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia after winning Europe, without controlling his emotions.
He gives the esophete to his countryman John Rem, who won the American golf legend of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single game with a score of 2:1.
"I feel tremendous pride in defeating Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now has a career record for the "Ryder Cup" 13–21–3.
Amazing statistics for one of the most famous players of all time, who won 14 Major Tourners, only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. assembly tried to reach the fairway area during all weekends, with the exception of Patrick Reade, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed high-level golf throughout the tour.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said about his team after a disconcerting performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we briefly dominated Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the United States Association of Professional Players and the Committee of the Ryder Cup Tourners, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
They are to be commended.
We lost."
