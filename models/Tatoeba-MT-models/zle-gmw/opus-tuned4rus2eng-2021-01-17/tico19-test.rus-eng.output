The coronavirus infection (COVID-19) was rapidly increasing in the European Union and the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
Communicable coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK, thereby confirming that, despite different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve preparedness for COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown ethos were reported in Hubei Province of China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the infection is caused by a new type of coronavirus, now known as the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-COV-2 has become known as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, about 80 percent of people with COVID-19 have an lung disease, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with most of the patients recovering.
About 14% of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe hospitalization condition, while the remaining 6% take a critical form when intensive treatment is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyses trends in the cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the UK, and compares them with those of Hubei Province of China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is now developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamics as China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveillance of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were recorded in France on 24 January 2020, all three of them returning from Hubei Province of China.
As at 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had detected COVID-19 infections, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750, including 1,441 fatal cases, were reported in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative disease of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates every day at 8 a.m. data on the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources such as the ministries of health of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.
COVID-19 was calculated as an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases in 14 days, taking into account the normal COVID-19 current in each EU/EEA country and in the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 on 15 March 2020, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in Great Britain
Trends in the 14-day semblance of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in Britain were generally consistent with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to rise around 21 February, and there was a surge (additional material) on 28 February 2020.
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK similar trends were observed in the cumulative disease of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, compared with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as at 8 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about three weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of registered COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative disease of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this is despite different stages in different countries, the differences in the response measures taken by national public health authorities, and perhaps different criteria for the recognition of cases, and different rules for the selection of patients for COVID-19 testing, including “up-to-date” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already as full as possible.
To date, data on admission of patients from COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) the EU/EEA Intensive Care Unit are only available for 6 per cent and 1 per cent respectively (not reported).
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such information in order to supplement current surveillance data, which are subject to the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a study carried out in 2010-2011, there is a significant variation in the number of beds in intensive care and in intensive care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth update of the ECDC on the results of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment presents scenarios for the modelling of the loading of health system resources with estimated data for the hospitalization of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of a shortage of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
As the cases are now grouped into certain EU/EEA and British regions, and hospitals and intensive care departments usually serve the population of a certain territorial group, information on infection cases and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to provide, as far as possible, nomenclatures of territorial units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and Britain.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for a long-term contact scenario of SARS-COV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and integrated approach is important to curb the proliferation of SARS-COV-2, with a subsequent shift from containment to minimization, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have sufficient time to understand, adopt and adjust their responses accordingly, unless such measures are taken in advance.
The rapid risk assessment report also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time in which they can intensify their monitoring efforts to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks, health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a flood of patients who will need intensive treatment.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 2 (SARS-COV-2), has become a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have died in China and elsewhere in the world and more than 80,000 people have been infected.
Like the homologous SARS-COV virus, which caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older persons more often than young and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on new diseases, this article provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject matter of the study.
We will look at basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnostics, treatment, prediction of further current and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The spring celebration (China’s New Year), which fell on January 25, 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for weeks after the outbreak of a new virus infection.
Given the high level of coronavirus (COV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the virus SARS-COV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the accompanying disease coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then in almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been detected, and more than 40,000 patients had recovered and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy to society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, ethics, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus separated from a number of patients.
The review is an attempt to synthesize research findings in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus-induced disease, the coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which erupted in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known to date on prevention and forecasting of the current, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among pathogens that are not deadly to humans and mainly cause about 15% of the total respiratory disease 4.
However, in this century, we have faced twice the highly pathogenic coronaviruses of humans, that is, the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV), which caused an outbreak of disease in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other States with a terrible severity of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first reported cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, a genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death in the city of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, medical workers were reported to be infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted from humans to humans.
On 23 January, a quarantine was imposed in the city of Uhan, and the city's public transport service ceased.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Uhan, which was considered a starting point for infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of the coronavirus was a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already reached about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
Given the rapid evolution of the situation, the final scale and degree of risk of outbreak remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centric clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with COVID-19 confirmed, provided the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 has been infected by all age groups, but most people between 30 and 65 years of age have been infected.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
The infection of SARS-COV-2 among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusters mainly in Hubei Province and nearby regions.
On average, 5 days (2–9) were taken from the time the symptoms of COVID-19 were exhibited to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0–7.2).
From the time the symptoms occurred to death, the average number of days was 9.5 (4.8 to 13 days).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the corrected R0 was 2.23-4.8.
By January 23, 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons, which coincided with large-scale traffic on the eve of China's New Year.
The mortality rate for confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10 - 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02 - 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 contamination were: sex (male), age (≥60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one thread of the RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta-coronaviruses are known to be affecting people.
In the case of coronaviruses of type SARS and MERS, glycoprotein glycoproteene of spice-shaped strata (S) is connected to cell receptors of type 2 angiotenzine converting enzyme (ACE2) and diptidyl peptidesis 4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
In the cytoplasm, the genome of the viral RNA is released; after replication of the viral genome, the genome RNA, together with the luxurious glycoprothenes and proteins of the nucleocopsis, generates viron-containing vesiculi, which then merge with the membrane of the cell, releasing the virus.
The first genomic sequence reports of SARS-COV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
SARS-COV-2 is found to be a new type of betacoronavirus whose genome is 99.98% similar to the 10 consecutive samples collected at the first outbreak of disease in the Juanan seafood market in Wuhan.
==History==SARS-COV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-COV than to MERS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 particles were found in ultra-tone cuts of human respiratory epithelia using an eclipse.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-COV-2, as well as for SARS-COV.
However, S-protein SARS-COV-2 links to the ACE2 enzyme of a person less than that of SARS-COV, which explains the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes patients to have a lower degree of illness than SARS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-lived protein encoded orf3b and secretly encoded orf8.
Orf3b of the SARS-COV-2 virus can play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the expression IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a group of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) submitted reports on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-length ACE2 human enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 Å at the B0AT1 amino acid transporter complex.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed information, was collected as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-protenins, which is evidence of coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-COV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Owner
Both SARS-COV and MERS-COV are known to be the source of bats from which the virus was transmitted to humans through cibres and camels, respectively.
The philogenetic comparison of SARS-COV-2 with other coronaviruses revealed that the first owners of SARS-COV-2 are bats, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely, the coronaviruses of SL-CVZX45 and SL-CVZX21.
However, it is not known which species has become the intermediate host, which has enabled the virus to break the species barrier and infect humans; the route of transmission is also yet to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the vectors of the virus from bats to humans were snakes, resulting in a homological recombination in the S-prothein.
According to their research, Chinese scientists in Guangzhou suggested that the pangolins, long-size mammals who feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate owners of SARS-COV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic resemblance between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-COV-2.
However, the difference of 1% distributed between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-COV-2 are mostly still unknown.
Under laboratory conditions, SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and between 40 and 50 per cent humidity.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-COV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; the virus can be effectively blocked by ester, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorine disinfectant, percussic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexide.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-COV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
At present, there is no detailed research on the immune response to SARS-COV-2.
So we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, especially SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Figure 4).
Typically, the virus in the host first recognizes the inborn immune system by means of image-recognizing receptors (ORPs), including receptors of Lectine C-type, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through a variety of mechanisms, the virus provokes the excitation of inflammation factors, the ripening of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferones, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the fagocytosis of macrofags against viral antigens.
However, the SARS-COV N-Quick can avoid immune reactions.
Soon an adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.
T-limphocytes, including T-cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in protecting the body.
T-cells CD4+ stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and T-cells CD8+ directly kill virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory citocines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T cell functions, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies removed from a recovering patient were neutralized by MERS-COV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system results in the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst scenario leads to polyorganic insufficiency and even death.
The SARS-COV-2 infection, which is characterized by clustering, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have immune problems.
According to a survey of the first 425 infections in the city of Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-COV-2 is between 1 and 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, with a difference of between 0 and 24 days.
More recently, a study based on demography data of 8,866 cases showed that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0–7.2).
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time frame for quarantine measures to take into account the most accurate calculation of the length of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected with the disease without symptoms.
It is common practice to have a 14-day quarantine for persons who have had contact with the virus or are infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptoms of COVID-19 are often high temperatures, which can be the only symptoms, or may be accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, obstructed breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, sniffing, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
A week after the outbreak of the disease, some patients suffered from respiratory and (or) hypoxia.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
High-temperature patients and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis, even if there are no pathologies in the chest.
A demographic survey carried out in late December 2019 revealed the following rates of symptoms: 98%, high temperature, 76%, dry cough, 55%, and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilation of their lungs.
Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies of domestic infections and transmission of the virus from non-symptomic infections.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-COV, who also had high temperatures (98%), dry cough (47%) and breath (55%).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial ventilation of their lungs, which is much higher than for patients with COVID-19, and corresponds to a higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), breath (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and throat pain (13-25%), and artificial ventilation of the lungs is required from 14-20%.
As at 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2 per cent, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide was 66,576.
By November 2002, the mortality rate for SARS was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study carried out in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to an earlier study, the base value of reproduction (R0) for SARS-COV-2 was set at 6.47 at 95% of the confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-COV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above figures show that SARS-COV-2 is more proliferating than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but the mortality rate for new virus infections is lower than the latter two.
Thus, it will be much more difficult to contain the SARS-COV-2 epidemic than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV epidemics.
Cluster displays often occur when infected within the same family or group of people who have gathered together for any reason or have come together on any transport, such as a cruise ship.
Patients have often travelled to the city of Uhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with infected or sick persons during the last two weeks prior to the outbreak of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients can again become carriers of the virus, and this is a warning signal for the extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphopia with white blood cells < 4×109/L, including white blood cells < 1×109/L, as well as elevated aperture-aminotransferase and virus levels.
Some patients found elevated levels of liver enzyme, muscle enzyme and myoglobin in their blood, and most patients had elevated C-reactive protein levels and red blood cells.
In patients with severe disease, the D-dimer level, the fibrine degradation product present in the blood has been increased and the number of lymphocytes has been steadily decreasing.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 found pathologies in the chest X-ray analysis with uneven blackouts on both sides or darkenings of the type of “matter glass” in their lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory disease.
In the development of an EPR, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of liquid and progressive fibrosis result in a significant disruption of gas exchange.
The pneumocytes of Types I and II reduce surface-activities and increase surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increase the risk of lung fall.
Thus, the worst X-ray results often coincide with the worst cases.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the separation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membrane and intertwined lymphocytary infiltration, and multi-nuclear syncythal cells in lung patients who died of the disease were consistent with viral infection pathologies and ARZs, similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criterion used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the detection method of SARS-COV-2 RNAs through a polymeraceous chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (reverse-transcrypted PCR).
However, given the high level of false negative results that could accelerate the epidemic, China began to diagnose from 13 February 2020 on the basis of clinical evidence (not relying solely on reverse-transcrypted PCRs).
The same was true of SARS diagnostics.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results.
On 14 February 2020, a team of specialists, led by Mr. Feng Zhang, described the protocol for the application of SHERLOCK, based on a repetition of CRISPR, to detect SARS-COV-2; this method allows for the detection of synthetic fragments of SARS-COV-2 RNAs with a density of 20 × 10 - 18 moles/l to 200 × 10 - 18 mole/l (10 - 100 copies per microlitre of the reference sample) with less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can greatly enhance the sensitivity and ease of testing.
Due to the lack of experience in countering the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors are basically able to provide patients with COVID-19 only with supportive therapy, while trying to apply any therapeutic methods used or offered in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, as well as other virus diseases (table (table 2).2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-viral drugs, immune agents, steroids, plasma of healed patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even plasma of healed patients should be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-COV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, as well as possibly to a lesser extent other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, work failure and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, in order to alleviate symptoms and save lives, it is critical to support the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are assigned according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulation technique used to treat life-threatening cardiovascular or respiratory deficiencies.
In addition, maintaining the water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organs are essential for patients with SARS-COV-2.
The cytokin storm is known to be the result of hyperreaction of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process developing in response to a series of citocines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN
These cytokines cause immunocytes to emit a huge amount of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of RHDs and polyorganic insufficiency.
In the treatment of the cytokin storm, especially for patients in serious condition, suppression of immunity is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumabs, monoclonic antibodies, serving as interlakin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat the cytokin storm.
Other techniques for treating cytokine storms based on the suppression of immunity include modulation of the immune response aimed at controlling T cells; blocking the production of cytokines IFN-α, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of the Janus-Kinaza; application of pan-atumomab, cytokine sensors 4 and hystondeacetalas ingibiters.
The use of steroids as agents of immunity is widespread in the treatment of SARS viruses to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes.
However, steroids in high doses are not useful in treating severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially awascular osteonocrosis, which significantly worsens the forecast.
However, short courses for corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended for use with caution in treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective anti-virus therapy.
However, the intravenous introduction of the remdesvire, the nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for the American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivere is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, the Remdesiver also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with single-chain RNAs, including those of MERS and SARS.
Based on these data, Gilead has provided this drug to China for a couple of tests on patients infected with SARS-COV-2, and the results are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavira and ribavirin were suggested as options for treatment for acute respiratory symptoms patients.
Combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavira may be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver failure and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other medicines assigned to patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibodies
Blood collection from patients recovering from contagious disease has long been used to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect a healthy population.
Indeed, the blood of healed patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to fight pathogen.
The antibodies are in the immunoglobulin produced by B-limphocytes to control pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.
Based on this premise, plasma was extracted from blood samples from a group of patients cured by COVID-19, which was then introduced to 10 severely ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, inflammation and viral stress decreased, and oxygen saturation increased.
However, in order to propose that the method be applied in a mass manner before specific treatment is carried out, untested and uncompleted explanations are required.
In addition, in view of the therapeutic effect, some shortcomings in the use of plasma should be carefully examined.
Antibodies, for example, can unduly stimulate the immune system and cause Cytokine release syndrome, which, given the toxicity, is a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma is needed to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the global epidemic.
It is therefore more important and more practical to separate the B-cells of healed patients and to define the genetic code of effective antibodies or screen to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can go straight to mass production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
Its effectiveness, however, depends to a large extent on a combination of multiple components of a formula that differs depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or uncertain, as it is difficult to separate and verify these components or to test their optimal combination.
At present, due to the lack of effective specific treatment of COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild and moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of illness.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were considered effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest proportion of patients who recovered from COVID-19 was found in a number of provinces in China where traditional Chinese medicine was used to treat 87 per cent of patients, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ninxy (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hubei, where traditional Chinese medicine was used to treat only about 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, the lowest proportion (13 per cent).
However, this is a rather rough comparison, since the evaluation must take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively in Western medicine and combined treatment in Western and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time frame for normalizing body temperature, correcting symptoms and providing hospital care was considerably shorter for patients who were treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who were treated only in Western medicine.
Most surprisingly, the proportion of patients who began to suffer from symptoms (from mild to heavy) was markedly lower in the group, which was treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine, than in the group, which was treated by Western methods only (7.4% as opposed to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% as opposed to 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficiency and security of Chinese traditional medicine still require more carefully monitored research on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest if possible to have a description of the mechanism and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine or a combination of them.
Patients suspected of or confirmed to have COVID-19 are mostly highly fearful of acutely contagious and even deadly diseases, and those who are quarantined also suffer from boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak caused by the SARS virus, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including chronic depression, heightened anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotorism, psychotic symptoms, deliriums and even suicidal behaviour.
Compulsory contact monitoring and quarantine, which are among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to persons suspected and in contact with them, and to all other people who require it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary psychiatric teams, the establishment of clear information with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-COV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission chain from animal carriers and infected people to sensitive hosts and are often used in addition to anti-viral therapy to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been done to develop S-protein-based vaccines aimed at developing long-lived and highly active antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed live, weakened vaccines against SARS viruses.
However, prior to the start of clinical research, the impact of these possible vaccines in the natural environment should be determined when they are used by age patients, the pattern of infection with lethal doses and the degree of protection against infection with zoonic viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported ever since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of disease caused by the MERS virus continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions as a result of the conservation of zoonic sources in endemic habitats.
To combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using the activated virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles and elements of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been assessed on animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 for those without immunity is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed in order to contain the rampant epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long time (average of 18 months) needed to develop the vaccine and the dynamic transformation of the coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical current of the disease at the cost of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with the high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease in order to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the clinical data provided so far, the following factors may affect the prediction of the current of the disease in patients with COVID-19 or be connected to it (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the current of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 affects mainly patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study, 8,866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have initial diseases and complications, and they were much older than those who did not need such treatment (average of 66 years versus 51 years), indicating that age is a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: The infection of SARS-COV-2 among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to develop acute myocardial and arrhythmia.
Cardiological phenomena were also the main cause of death for patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-COV-2 could also be associated with ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which could cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely linked and can distort results.
Deviations identified in laboratory studies: the C-reactive protein level in the blood reflects the severity of inflammatory process or tissue damage and is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor in the current of the disease, reaction to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between the C-reactive protein level, the severity of the disease and the projection at COVID-19 should be taken into account.
In addition, increased levels of lactatedehydrogenase, aminotransferase asparagina, alanin-aminotransferase and creatinzinase can also predict the result.
These enzymes are in large quantities separated by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and released by tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: In order to predict results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, data from the chest X-ray study and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account, among other factors.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunities that are commonly used in infectious diseases as complementary therapy to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS forms, many of the survivors developed an awascular osteonocrosis that caused lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if the use of steroids is necessary to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be given in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure prolonged quarantine periods, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and witness the death of their relatives and other patients.
Psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided to reduce the stress of such patients and help them to return to normal life.
According to demographic studies carried out so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be distinct from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in lower respiratory paths, the SARS-COV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses causing common cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in upper respiratory paths and cause weak symptoms or no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients whose early stage of the disease or the incubation period has not yet ended may, through their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, making epidemiological surveillance very difficult.
However, the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus was believed to occur when patients were seriously ill, while in most cases the infection did not occur at an early stage.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it's harder to control.
China is currently working hard to declare universal quarantine in the city of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, and to extend the quarantine regime for virtually the entire population, which has been introduced to break the proliferation chain of the SARS-COV-2 virus.
While these measures have caused enormous damage to the economy and other areas of the country ' s life, the number of new patients identified has been declining, indicating a slower spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will be over by March, and the fading phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues estimated that the outbreak of COVID-19, which looks much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) designed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-COV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-COV-2 virus was found in nose and throat swabs taken from patients who recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the decline in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, pointing out that the strategies currently employed may have had an impact.
Initial predictions suggest that Ebola would affect up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.
But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to control it.
It is likely that, like the SARS-COV virus, the infective potential of the SARS-COV-2 virus can weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with those of SARS and MERS (Figure 55) is given below.
The SARS-COV-2 virus is characterized by high transmission rates through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the cripple, which means that oral fecal transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 cases studied may have resulted from infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders, contacting patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; and surgical masks and N95-class respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgeon masks prevent micro-capables from spreading liquids from potentially infected people into the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (series No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virion sizes of 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5% of virion; SARS-COV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-COV, both of which are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, health workers who are in direct contact with patients must wear N95 masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health workers should wear a uniformed protective robe to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also reach the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-COV-2 even though he wore a Class N95 mask; the virus may have hit his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent face boards or closed-type protective glasses.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands with disinfectant washing tools more frequently, to try to stay at home while maintaining self-insulation and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
A reasonable distance to a patient is a distance of about one metre.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-COV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, its high level of similarity with SARS-COV, as reported on 7 January 2020, was to be a warning to China, taking into account its experience during the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Center for Disease Control in Uhan calmed the population, reporting that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive procreation from person to person, and that prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement has significantly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing for the celebration of China's New Year, and a critical time has been missed when the disease could be contained within the city of Ouhan with minimal losses.
China’s health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since each word is considered by citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain the potential epidemic in the early stages of its development rather than calm the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly monitor and improve the public response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by a previously unexplored coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type II (SARS-COV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China and, at the time of writing, has spread to 50 countries in the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a relapse of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are relevant to controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality rates among older persons are also higher than among young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even in an unsymptomic course, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases, so it is more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-COV-2 is spreading much faster and larger than SARS-COV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative conventional samples for SARS-COV-2 RNAs.
On the other hand, cured patients can again show positive samples for the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Against the background of such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-COV-2 virus?
Despite the detection of a 96% homologist between SARS-COV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that SARS-COV-2 infection was from bats.
What kind of animal has become an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transmission route, and the epidemiological situation can escalate at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-COV-2 is connected to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory path cells and induce subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of transmission from human to human?
Will it cause a global pandemic, disappear as SARS, or relapse from time to time like a flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
But we have no choice but to, whatever the cost, stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zoonic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated co-evolution of coronaviruses (COV) and their carriers, including human beings, for millennia.
Before 2003, it was known that two human coronavirus (HCV) causes a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening a human coronavirus can be.
The appearance of the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type II (SARS-COV-2) in central China in late 2019 again attracted attention to the coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmission but less pronounced pathogenicity of the virus than the associated SARS-COV virus.
A human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and an understanding of its zoonic origin will be very useful.
The majority of human coronaviruses are derived from bats for which they are not pathogens.
There are also known intermediate carriers of some human coronaviruses.
The definition of animal carriers has a direct impact on the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Research on coronavirus - bearer animals can also shed light on coronavirus pathogenesis in humans.
In this survey, we provide available data on the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on their history of detection, as well as their zoonic origins and modes of inter-species transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of disease caused by the coronavirus found in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for successful change of hosts and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar RNA thread.
These viruses with the largest RNA-containing genome, containing between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides, have been named because of their form, which, when viewed under an electronic microscope, resembles the crown.
From a structural point of view, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with the same organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcast in the polyprothenes of the app1a and pp1ab relics.
These polyprothenes are later processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spice protein (S), silk protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronaviruses also encode a number of lynic special accessor proteins.
Based on the differences in protein \ coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma and deltacoronaviruses), with betacoronaviruses containing the majority of human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is philological evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and betacoronaviruses is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecies barriers, and some of them have evolved to pathogens that are dangerous to humans.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include human alphacoronaviruses HCV-229E and HCV-NL63.
The remaining five beta-coronaviruses include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV), the coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV) and the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type II SARS-COV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of light form, such as cold and (or) diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and recently detected SARS-COV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe infectious lower respiratory diseases in relatively larger numbers of patients with a higher risk of acute respiratory disease (ARS) and abnormal symptoms.
The first thread of the human coronavirus HCV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample separated from a nosole of patients suffering from a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has generated more knowledge of HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were ill, and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long-term epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadicly to the rest of the world.
The new coronavirus, discovered in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-COV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which, as of 3 March 2020, killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people.
An alarm has been received, and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are of zoonic origin, their sources are bats, mice, or pets.
Numerous data sets have shown in favour of the evolutionary nature of all human coronaviruses from bats whose organisms are well adapted and without pathogenic properties, but exhibit a wide range of genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic challenged China and the world from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.
Research on the zoonic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will help to understand their natural history, the forces of their evolution and the factors limiting inter-species transport.
It may also suggest or accelerate the search for an intermediate and amplifying SARS-COV-2 carrier, which is very important to prevent the re-emerging of the disease in the future.
This overview provides general information on the zoonic origin, inter-species transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following common feature: the original viruses that have produced human coronaviruses are not usually pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but are pathogenic after inter-species transmission to the new host.
We are also analysing the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by reduced pathogenic properties.
The result of the current SARS-COV-2 outbreak is also considered in the same context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the strain of B814 HCV-229E was first extracted from a sample separated from a nosole of cold patients, various coronaviruses were found in different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been detected in recent decades.
Table 1 provides an informative and illustrative summary of the history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCV-229E virus was derived from samples taken from the respiratory paths of patients with an infectious upper respiratory failure in 1966; it was subsequently adapted to breed in the pulmonary cell lines of WI-38.
Patients infected with HCV-229E showed cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, general malaise and throat pain, with high temperatures and coughing in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was released from organ culture and subsequent massage in the brain of the sucker mice.
The clinical signs of HCV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCV-229E, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens, such as Type A influenza virus and Rhinovirus.
Both the HCV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus are common in the world and are usually transmitted during winter time in moderate latitudes.
Mostly the incubation period of the two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to a volunteer study, healthy people infected with the HCV-229E virus developed a common pulmonary cold.
Only a few patients with reduced immunity showed severe infection in the lower respiratory paths.
The outbreak of SARS, also known as the “atypical pneumonia epidemic”, was the first well-documented pandemic in human history to be caused by the human coronavirus, and the virus SARS-CoV, the third known human coronavirus, was the cause of the disease.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.
Excluding super-active distributors, it was estimated that each of the patients could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days, and the viral load peaked at 10 days.
Patients infected with SARS-COV initially had muscle pains, headaches, high temperature, general malaise and cold, and later symptoms included respiratory, coughing and respiratory failure.
Common laboratory deviations from the standard for SARS are lymphopia, liver sample disturbances and elevated creatinase levels.
Patients with SARS are also exposed to diffuse alveolar damage, epithele cell proliferation, and macrophages.
About 20–30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation of their lungs.
Other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may also be infected in such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tracts, usually accompanied by a cytokin storm, which may be fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
For the first time, the virus was singled out from an open biopsy of a patient’s lung relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCV-NL63 was assigned to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
Initially, it was found to affect mainly young children, older persons and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory diseases.
HCV-NL63 is characterized by shrivelling, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolite.
Another independent study describes the separation of the same virus from an 8-month-old boy in the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of the diseases it causes is at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCV-NL63 is linked to the obstructive laryngitis, which is also called the croupe.
HCV-HKU1 was singled out in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCV-HKU1 is linked to asthmatic diseases.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, the HCV-HKU1 virus causing lung respiratory disease was detected worldwide.
All four of the coronaviruses of the human being, causing out-of-hospital infections, have been well adapted to humans, and their mutation, resulting in highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents were and their causes are unknown, as in a rare example of a more virulent subtype of HCV-NL63, which has recently reportedly caused serious infection of the lower respiratory paths in China.
Usually, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic by acquiring the ability to effectively transmit and maintain themselves in humans.
The coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV) was first released in Saudi Arabia in 2012 from a 60-year-old lung patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, there have been import cases and distributions through occasional secondary cases of contagion in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak of 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), both of which are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also developed acute kidney failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronaviruses transmitted to humans.
More than 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases of high-death Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent) were recorded, and MERS-CoV is therefore considered one of the most deadly viruses known to humans.
Between mid-December 2019, Hubei Province of China found patient clusters with pneumonia, which, looking back in the past, are now linked to infection caused by a coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CV-2).
The World Health Organization announced that the continued outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-COV-2 was a global public health emergency, and the disease itself became known as Crown Viral Infection 19 (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with approximately 3.4 per cent mortality.
It should be noted that mortality is 4.2 per cent in Hubei Province of China and 1.2 per cent outside China.
SARS-COV-2, like SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by rising temperatures, cough, and breath.
Some patients also experience diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to rapidly enter acute respiratory syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of philogenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but has a greater potential for transmission than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 cases of non-symptom-free infection have been recorded, indicating that the virus is likely to spread rapidly worldwide.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-COV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, transmissible coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this respect, SARS-COV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-COV and four human coronaviruses causing outpatient infections (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-COV-2 infections are similar to those most commonly found in human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections, including non-specific symptoms, mild symptoms or even absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-COV, a small sub-group of severe COVID-19 cases can be distinguished, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, the SARS-COV-2 transmission plan also shows interesting patterns that are common to both human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections and SARS-COV.
On the one hand, the transferability of SARS-COV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses causing outpatient infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be checked whether the transmission of SARS-COV-2 is decreasing with each subsequent transition of the virus (i.e. infection of each next person), as in the cases of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-COV-2 can be found in scala samples.
We still have to answer the question as to whether the fecal-oral path of the transfer of SARS-COV-2 is as important (at least under some circumstances) as it is for SARS-COV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-COV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.
Nevertheless, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-COV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable distribution after a human transition.
All four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections with lung symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, perhaps these people have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be described as the only survivors of past human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause severe disease in humans and people whose human coronaviruses cause severe disease have simply not survived.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses have to replicate in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations that counter the constraints of the host.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus is fully adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop its transmission among people through quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, four out-of-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing common cold among people with healthy immunity.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
The highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-COV and MERS-COV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and reproduce in their zoonose tanks and look for the occurrence of vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or augmenting carriers.
SARS-COV-2 has features such as SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCOV outpatient viruses.
It's very easily transmitted as an out-of-hospital HCOV, at least now.
But he's more pathogenic than HCV out-of-hospital and less pathogenic than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to humans and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and reservoir carriers of HCV viruses.
The animal is an evolutionary host of HCOV if it carries a close-born ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequencing level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic in this medium.
Similarly, HCOV has been continuously transported over a long period of time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCOV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCOV was only placed in an intermediate carrier just before or around the time when it was carried to a person, it was not well adapted to the new host and was often pathogenous.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonosis source of human infection and play a growing host role, allowing the virus to replicate zipperically and then hand it over to people, increasing the incidence of human infection.
HCOV can survive a dead end infection if it can't withstand a transmission inside an intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate medium and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological evidence has shown retrospectively that the zero patient SARS had an anamnese contact with hunting and fishing animals (wilder).
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that the prevalence of IgG antibodies in the SARS-COV virus is higher than in the general population.
The Himalayan cyvetes (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog in living animals' markets were the first known carriers of viruses like and almost identical to SARS-COV.
This was implicitly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all the cibes in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan cyves, living in nature or on farms and not entering markets, had not been determined in most cases by SARS-CoV, which led to the conclusion that Himalayan cyves could serve only as an intermediate augmenting host rather than as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Significantly, since 80 per cent of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies for SARS-COV, it is not impossible to rule out the possibility that multiple species of small mammals can also be intermediate augmentors.
They all seem to be the deadliest carriers of the SARS-COV virus.
A subsequent search for a natural animal carrying SARS-COV revealed a close-fashioned COV of bats, which was referred to as the SARSr-Rh-BatCOV HKU3 coronavirus associated with atypical pneumonia, and which is present in Chinese podcast bats.
These mice are positive on antibodies to SARS-COV and the genomic sequence SARSr-Rh-BatCOV HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses of bats have the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV by 88-92%.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats had become bearers of new human pathogens.
The bats also found several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-COV), but none of them except one, which means WIV1, cannot be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-COV receptor is known to be the human angiotenzine converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, derived from a sample of bat feces, uses ACE2 bats, cybetes and humans as a receptor for entering the cage.
Interestingly, the serums of recovering patients from SARS could neutralize the WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, dividing 95% of the nucleotide homology.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not the direct parent of SARS-COV and that bats are not the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-COV.
The MERS-CoV is classified as a group of COV-HKU4 bats and COV-HKU5 bats.
COV-HKU4 bats and MERS-COV use the same host receptor, dipeptyldipidezu-4 (DPP4) to infiltrate viruses.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of the MERS-COV virus are philogeneticly closer to the sequences of betacoronaviruses of bats detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild bats have not found a live MERS-COV virus.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences MERS-COV and its closest relative COV-HKU25 bats is only 87%.
So bats may not have been the direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-COV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-brown camels are seropositive of antidote-specific antibodies specific to MERS-COV, as well as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The living MERS-COV, identical to the virus found in humans, was removed from the swabs of single rib camels, further confirming the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-COV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimented with MERS-COV had slight symptoms, but massive viral dispersion.
Significantly, the infected camels produced the virus not only by respiratory means but also by fecal-oral means, which is also the main way of extracting the virus from bats.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome did not have any contact with camels before the symptoms occurred, and are plausible in terms of human transmission or transmission by unknown channels, including unknown species of animals that are carriers of MERS-COV.
The nucleotide nucleotide geology of SARS-COV-2 is 96.2 per cent similar to the COV RaTG13 of the bats selected from the Asian subconduits Rhinophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the divergence between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to attribute parenting to them.
That is, bats may not have been a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-COV-2 unless in the future almost identical coronaviruses of bats are found.
Suggestedly, the direct animal carriers of the SARS-COV-2 virus should be among the wild species sold and killed on the Ouhan optic seafood market, which was associated with many initial COVID-19 cases, which suggests a possible transfer from an animal to a human.
Several recent metageneomic sequencing studies have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as Panis javanica (Manis javanica) could also carry parent betacoronavirus related to the SARS-COV-2 strain.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new genomes is 85-92% similar to SARS-COV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with the identity at the nucleotide sequence level being about 90%.
They are clustered into two sublines of differentiation of viruses such as SARS-COV-2 in a philogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-COV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequences.
In contrast, SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 RSDs are more divergent, despite the higher degree of homology of sequences in the entire genome.
An earlier study of Pangolin patients also reported the definition of viral contiguity in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-COV-2.
The study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to produce a genome sequence of about 86.3 per cent of the full-scale viral genome.
It is not impossible to rule out the possibility that the pangolin has become one of the intermediate animal carriers of SARS-COV-2.
However, as a result of the diverging sequences between SARS-COV-2 and the betacoronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-COV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-COV-2 from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-COV-2 and the betacoronaviruses associated with SARS-COV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-COV-2 has not yet been established for bats, pangolins and other mammals.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in the RSD between SARS-COV-2 and the betacoronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest homology of sequences across the genome.
Very theoretically, a high degree of resemblance between the betacoronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-COV-2, and SARS-COV-2 is linked to parallel evolution through selectiveness.
The opposing proposal favours a recombination between the betacoron virus of pangolins related to SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonic origin of SARS-COV-2.
In addition to HCOV viruses, the zoonic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 are also studied.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E can be derived from the coronaviruses of bats, while the parent viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
It was reported that a coronavirus of bats called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in a North American three-coloured suctioner showed a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E is genetically linked to another coronavirus of bats called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate host could also be camels.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
Philogenetic analysis provided evidence of the events of the HCV inter-species transmission in anamnesia.
When the HCV-OC43 virus was transmitted interspecies around 1890 and people were infected by domestic animals, a respiratory pandemic was reported.
The history of HCV-229E interspecies is not so clear.
Alphacoronaviruses of bats, similar to HCOV-229E, were found.
There's an alpaca alphacoronavirus between them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was people, not alpacas, who could contact bats in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, alphacoronaviruses of bats associated with HCV-229E are diverse and nepathogenic in bats, while alphacoronavirus of alpaca has caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alphacoronavirus was not found in wild animals.
Thus, the probability that the alpacas have received an alphacoron virus related to HCV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that bats could directly pass HCV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while alphacoronaviruses of bats could serve as the gene pool of the HCV-229E virus, alpacas and singlerbial camels could be intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just like the MERS-COV virus.
MERS-COV provides an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to single rib camels and from single rib camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its original identification and was then confirmed by subsequent research.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make bats “the perfect spreaders.”
On the other hand, the MERS-COV virus was introduced to single-rib camels decades ago.
It adapted well to these camels, which from an intermediate host became a stable and natural reservoir host.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very slight disease and is characterized by relatively low mutations.
His occasional transmission to a man is an accident, and the man remains a dead end bearer of MERS-COV because his transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the MERS-COV transmission, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus is different.
In particular, the betacoronaviruses of pangolines are highly pathogenic to the pangolines.
They can be dead-end carriers of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-COV-2, as well as cyvets in the case of SARS-COV.
In future studies, several possibilities for interspecies transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus from animals to humans need to be confirmed or eliminated.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-COV-2, almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
People can divide the ecological niche with bats by coal mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Second, the pangolins may be one of the intermediate augmenting carriers in which a related SARS-COV-2 virus has recently been infected.
People are infected with the virus through carcass cutting and the consumption of animal meat.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-COV-2.
The survey of domestic and wild animals on antibodies is justified.
Third, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-COV-2 could have occurred in a third form, which had contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-COV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of animal carriers, the three main factors on the part of viruses have also contributed to the intersection of inter-species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered “medium-high” with an average frequency of approximately 10-4 replacements per year for one section 2 depending on the stage of adapting the coronavirus to the new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in an extremely high rate of mutation and loss or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogy of Remdesivere suppresses the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivere is one of the most promising tools against SARS-COV-2, which needs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, mutation frequency can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-COV with high mutation rates, the frequency of SARS-COV-2 mutations is likely to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV, which is well adapted to single rib camels.
Theoretically, vaccines and antiviral drugs from SARS-COV-2 are unlikely to quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large genome of RNA in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the probability of interspecies coevolence, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by the many unique open frame of reading and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3 ' end of the genome.
Third, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch the matrix during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the host, which serves as a mixing vessel, threads are often switched.
High-level, full-dimensional and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and in coronaviruses such as SL-COV and BatCoV-HKU9 bats.
Interaction of the virus with regard to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, another key factor important for inter-species transmission is the interaction of the virus with the host receptor.
This article provides a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in inter-species transfer events, a recombination of SARS-CoV.
Based on a comparative analysis between the SARS-COV strains of humans and cyvets, SARS-COV is believed to be rapidly adapting in different media, especially with regard to mutations to RSD protein S.
In general, RSD squirrel S interacts with the cellular receptor, and the antibodies of the host actively select it.
SARS-COV is an amino acid, from 318 to 510, on a fragment of S1, which links the virus to the angiotensin perverting enzyme 2 (APF2) of humans, as well as its cohorts.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD can recognize APF2 receptors of different animals, including bats, civates, mice, and raccoon dogs, making it possible to transmit the virus interspecies.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in the RSD, which differ from human viral strains and cyvets, 4 of which are in a receptor-related motive to interact with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-Cov cyvets have mutations of K479N and S487T in the RSD, which can increase the affinity of the spine protein to the human receptor of APF2.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important in adapting the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-COV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
The difference of 30 per cent between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in segment S1 of protein S results in the possible change of the S protein affinity to human APF2.
Indeed, the cryoelectronic microscope study suggests that the affinity of this connection is 10 to 20 times higher than between APF2 and protein S of the SARS-COV virus.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors were required for the transfer of SARS-COV-2.
It's surprising that HCV-NL63 also links to APF2 but to another segment of S protein.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as Aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E and 9-O-acetyl acid for HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for successfully adapting these coronaviruses to humans after interspecies transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the HCV inter-species transmission is also controlled by other factors of dependence and restraint of the host.
Divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural HCVs reservoir carriers, such as bats, single-rural camels and rodents, may constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful inter-species transmission to HCVs, it is necessary to usurp the factors of dependence and to subdue the factors of restraction of carriers.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important field of interaction between the virus and the host still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can result in an impartial, full-genomic screening of dependency factors and restrective carriers for SARS-COV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
Emerging new HCOV: back to zero
The variety of coronaviruses of bats creates a great deal of potential for new HCOVs.
In this sense, the coronaviruses of bats serve as a genetic pool for HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCOV and are two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the Accessor Proteins, SARS-COV is considered important for adapting to humans, as the viruses of bats related to SARS-COV have been isolated, but they have been found to coding orF8 divergent proteins.
In the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide division was found, characteristic of the SARS-CoV coronaviruses.
This division breaks OrF8 into OrF8a and OrF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-coronavirus lines where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Localization of the recombination was also defined in non-structural nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-rib camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCOVs, where HCOV recombined other animals with coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which are likely to occur as a result of the virus being freed from the sequel pressure, for example, from the host immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain HCOV-229E through a bi-nucleotide deputation.
While an intact open OrF4 reading frame can be observed in the viruses of the bat and camel associated with HCV-229E, the alphacoronavirus of the alpaca displays a single-nucleotide box, leading to a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoir carriers.
Infected by bats with coronaviruses, slight or no symptoms were recorded, indicating a mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the inflammatory response of bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats has been suppressed by the apregulation of the inhibitor receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low level of expression of the molecules of the main Class I complex.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen, which is produced by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, simultaneously influencing the reading of exoribonuclease, thus creating a sampling pressure to generate strains of the virus that, when entering the new host, are highly pathogenic.
The more pathogenic strains of the coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or the properties of the protein to adapt the host.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last 20 years.
Coronaviruses are nepathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They replicate confidently without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is the secret to why we see unsymptomic carriers and what causes severe human infections.
The severe symptoms are mainly associated with the hyperactivity of the immune response and the cytokin storm, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the lung injury.
On the contrary, the immune response of unsymptomic carriers does not involve the replication of the coronavirus.
The same anti-immune response strategy can have positive effects in anti-SARS-COV-2 therapy.
The bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, the acceptance of type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-COV-2 infection, should be beneficial for humans.
In addition, the bats have been disrupted by NLRP3-inflammasom activation.
On this basis, the inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasoma with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 follows the general pattern that created SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
While the bat betacoronavirus, whose nucleotide homology is 95% the same as SARS-COV, is found, there is also a bat coronavirus, whose nucleotide homology is 96% the same as SARS-COV-2.
Although it has been found that cyvetes and other animals in the markets carry viruses, identical SARS-COVs have not been installed directly for SARS-COV-2.
The betacoronaviruses of the pangolin were found, astonishingly homologic SARS-COV-2, indicating that the pangolins could be one of the intermediate hosts, or that fragments of the genes of the betacoronaviruses of the pangolins could be included in the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
The coronaviruses have attracted general attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-COV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonic origin and HCV animal reserves in human transmission.
Convincing evidence showed that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 originated from bats and were transmitted to the human through intermediate hosts.
If the SARS-COV infection comes from contact between people and cyvets in markets, closing the wild markets and destroying the cilities in them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of various lines of betacoronaviruses of pangolines close to SARS-COV-2, the pangolines should be removed in order to prevent the zoonic transmission of infection from the food markets.
However, whether SARS-COV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals, and how this can continue to be the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV virus has long existed in single-row camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for control of MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the proliferation of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to halt the periodic outbreaks of MERs, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-COV for camels, combined with other infectious control measures.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, there may be new genes that cause outbreaks.
The world is circulating a variety of zoonic coronaviruses.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonic potential are extremely diverse.
There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and (or) more deadly to humans.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
After severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 steels, better preparedness and a plan to respond to such situations are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be seized.
Although many of the properties of bats are beneficial to the spread of viruses, it is possible to minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
For a better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed, which will be useful in preventing the transfer of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the virus is to keep people away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of the zoonic viruses.
SARS-COV-2 is still missing some fragments.
First, if bats have passed the Ancestral SARS-COV-2 virus to the pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same environmental niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-COV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, a pangolin, or another mammal, it's expected that SARS-COV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-COV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases” COVID-19 need to be updated.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a brief reference manual on the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCOV), which provides insights into our experience and valid recommendations to combat the pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and we present the latest diagnostic criteria for “surveillance” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Treatment for COVID-19” (the seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), began to erupt, and the virus itself was called the "heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-COV-2 infection, our team developed a short reference manual and published it on the Internet on the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted great attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven issues of the “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Treatment for COVID-19” published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were issued, with some of its provisions significantly changing.
Recently, the work done by Zhou (Zhou) with the co-sponsors commented on our recommendations, which contained simple proposals for diagnostics based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on this global pandemic.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our appreciation.
However, according to the latest edition of the Recommendations on Diagnostics and Treatment for COVID-19 (probable seventh version) and on-going research, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of the document (dated 3 March 2020), a single element of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease must be combined to provide a comprehensive analysis of the case of suspected illness:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or location in and around the city of Wuhan, or in other localities where cases of COVID-19 were reported within 14 days before symptoms were detected; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-COV-2 (positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from the city of Uhan and its environs or other localities where cases of COVID19 were reported during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms recorded for two weeks in small areas such as a home or a house, a school, a classroom, etc.).
Clinical: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external exposure to COVID-19; (3) total white blood cells are normal or reduced with reduced lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
Diagnosis for confirmed cases should be based on suspicion of a disease with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence points, namely: (1) real-time PCR tests are positive for SARS-COV-2; (2) full-genomic sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity for new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-COV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in test result from negative to positive for SARS-COV-2 antibodies of IgG, or an increase in titra at least four times in the recovery phase of the relevant acute phase.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of the document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory paths or blood samples was added.
Pathogenic diagnostics of the blood sample were added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions, and then the seventh issue added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of respiratory samples, including blood sampling, which improves the availability of different samples and helps to incorporate positive test results for specific antibodies into the disease validation criteria.
However, there is growing evidence of the need for caution in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without express symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in the work of Zhou (Zhou) et al. should be updated as it classifies persons without clinical symptoms as a low-risk group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practices and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspects” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations that are made in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, a day maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in a day.
That's the largest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 ongoing cases of infection, as well as 33 recovering patients at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two deaths were aged over 60, two between the ages of 51 and 60, and one between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic official told the local news agency Anadole that Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was one of the dead, who was being treated at the Maitri clinic in Kuwait.
On Saturday, on an online video, Bangladesh's Minister for Road and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, stated that public transport would cease for longer than originally planned until the next Saturday.
Public transport was stopped from 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods — medicines, fuel and food — has still been authorized.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March for two people who returned from Italy, as well as for one of their wives.
As of 19 March, the three men had already recovered.
SARS-COV-2 has crossed a millionth of the world's infections
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of coronavirus infections worldwide exceeded one million.
The coronavirus COVID-19 killed at least 52,000 people.
The accident occurred on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first case of infection and Zambia recorded the first case of death from a coronavirus.
North Korea claimed that it was one of the few countries with no coronavirus infection as of Thursday.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10:00 Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to Johns Hopkins University data, reported more than 1,000 deaths due to coronavirus infection in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced increased measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobyan, extended the regime of self-insulation of the citizens of the city until May 1.
President Vladimir Putin had previously stated that Russians throughout the country, despite their isolation, would receive wages until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of an extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of the voting was 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy towns of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while the previous curfew lasted from only 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that the state self-insulation regime had been extended by order until May 1.
Shops in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian Walworths and Coles stores have reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time in all stores in the country, to two and one package, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a cap on one package.
These restrictions were reported in the cashier's ads as well as on the Facebook page.
Citizens are reported to have started to make emergency stocks because of fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a general self-insulation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on 4 and 5 March, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited the number to 4 packages.
The Colles trading network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that, with the introduction of a restriction on four packages, “many shops still buy toilet paper too quickly, one delivery within an hour”, and called such a demand “unprecedential”, while ALDI on a Facebook post published on Tuesday called this trend “unexpected”.
According to Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the number to two packages last week.
To make up for the shortfall, Coles began ordering larger shipments from suppliers and increasing the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made stocks for a special stock of early sales on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Ritter Association, reported that the restockers were trying to replenish the stock, but this was made difficult by the restrictions on the travel schedule of trucks by local authorities.
It looked forward to increasing the cost of products, as suppliers were trying to meet demand, but less and less favourable offers were available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, owing to stock depletion, some stores were unable to share on Wednesdays.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the University of Technology of Queensland, told us that stores restock every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a cumbersome product, so the stock stock stock was small and, after the sale of the entire product, the long rows of shelves remained empty, exacerbating the lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers would probably not panic so much,” says Russell Zimmerman.
In the last Wednesday, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Who Givens a Crap, announced the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a toilet paper company, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent brands, reported that they worked 24 hours a day to provide sufficient quantities of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne fell due to the absence of buyers during the week of Labour Day, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The Thursday issue of NT News, published in Darwin, included a tab of eight pages for cutting and use as toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report of March 3, shops initially reluctantly imposed restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, claiming that they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, galantery, hand-washing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening, it was observed that the Ocado online store of the British supermarket also restricted the sale of toilet paper by Andres to two packages of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a COVID-19 infectious disease pandemic caused by the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus.
Although the term “pandemia” refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to take action:
“All countries together are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate, monitor cases of disease, and mobilize their citizens,” the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom Gebreous, explained.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming prevalence and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedent.”
He said in an interview on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than flu has yet been monitored from its inception to its continued global spread.”
Mr. Gebreus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international importance and then gave it a new status — a pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauchie, said, "This is just the beginning, it's going to get worse."
According to Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019-2020 is the current coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome Syndrome .
The outbreak was detected in Ouhan, China, in December 2019, and a public health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing, and respiratory problems.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between the first symptoms and the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also range from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The basic treatment is symptomatic and supportive: Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering mouths with cough, maintaining distances between people, detecting and ensuring self-insulation of people suspected of infection.
The authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closures.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or elimination of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as widespread shortages of products aggravated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting some 99.4 per cent of the world ' s students.
The Internet has begun to spread misinformation about the virus, xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens, or people who resemble them, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where there are significant cases of the spread of the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased as a result of reduced travel and closure of heavy industry.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in the city of Wuhan (Hubay), China, reported cases of pneumonia with unknown cause, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Infectious cases were mainly linked to the Juanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to be of zoonosis origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-COV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that has a large resemblance to the coronaviruses of the bat, the coronaviruses of the pangoline and the SARS-CoV. Later it was found that the very first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019 and that the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, a publication by the South China branch of the newspaper Morning Post, which had not been verified, suggested that the very first case of infection had occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the incidence of new infections in China had fallen but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases can be significantly underestimated, in particular because of the number of cases with weak symptoms.
By 26 February, there had been relatively few cases of infection among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4 per cent worldwide, and the United Kingdom Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Wallance estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity was established.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test was positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, a formal policy had been adopted not to conduct testing with only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, 86 per cent of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China and that such unregistered patients had become sources of infection for 79 per cent of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infection (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this figure could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are recovering safely.
In other more complex cases, the time from the beginning of symptoms to the moment of death ranged from 6 to 41 days, and the most frequent time was 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent of deaths were related to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic typically include deaths of patients with positive results on COVID tested according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not include those who have not been tested — for example, in their own homes, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVID figures by 4 to 5 times.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Spokesperson acknowledges: “We know that [the reported number of deaths] is lower than actual.” His words are supported by reports of some isolated cases in the U.S., which are often incomplete in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 Swine Influenza epidemic, and the first confirmed death was recorded in Uhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and on 14 February in France outside Asia.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents other than Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods were usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary according to the region and the time of the spread of the disease; they are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time of the outbreak and the parameters of the population, such as age, gender and general health status. The mortality/infection ratio is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed infections within the specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality-to-pregnancy ratio fell from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of the percentage of deaths due to disease (CFR), the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from disease and the percentage of deaths due to infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
The University of Oxford Centre of Evidence estimates that the overall mortality rate from this pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The top figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random testing on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with the statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO argues that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash cannot be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Matei Boni, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, states that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to go to the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers ends, they begin to fade.
However, in the current situation, it is virtually impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.”
The Chinese Government's Senior Medical Adviser, Jun Nanshan, claims that “everything can be over by June” if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO's recommendations on measures to halt the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-COV-2 would “circumvent perhaps within a year or two.”
According to a study carried out by the Imperial College under Neil Ferguson, “until the vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) is available”, physical distancing and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, an employee of the University of Vanderbilt, says, "I don't think that this coronavirus will ever disappear forever, because it is so easily transmitted," and that it may “be transformed into a seasonal disease that flares up every year.”
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may suffer the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are elevated temperature (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetness in the respiratory paths (silence), loss of smell, breath, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chilling, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list acute symptoms such as respiratory problems, permanent pains or feelings of chest depression, sudden feeling of consciousness confusion, difficulties in awakening and blueness of the face or lips. If these symptoms are present, medical attention should be immediately sought. Further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and death.
In some infected people, the disease may run unsymptomically, without any clinical effects, but the results of the tests confirm the infection, so doctors recommend that patients who are in close contact with confirmed patients be placed under strict control and tested for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate the number of cases of non-symptomic currents ranging from a few to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; usually it is five days. It is not yet fully clear about the symptom of loss of smell: the initial estimate is that the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptom initially was 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small droplets released into the air with cough, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Some studies indicate that drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) with open cough.
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops released into the air during a conversation that can stay in the air for a longer time. Respirator drops can also be produced by exhalation, including during a conversation, although the virus is usually not transported through the air.
Drips can reach the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (CLR), can lead to the dispersal of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches the contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also fears that the virus can be transmitted through fecals, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission of SARS-COV-2. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the symptoms appear, although it may occur both before the symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.
There were times when tests were positive in testing three days before the symptoms appeared, which suggests that the virus can be transmitted before the symptoms are expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of non-symptomic disease, but contact monitoring studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from non-symptomatic carriers.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that it is not clear how easily the virus is spread, yet it is known that one patient usually infects two to three other people, and the virus can survive on surfaces from hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304), the virus could live for up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day, and on the copper surface for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, with positive results for domestic and other animals on COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as they do after contacting other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
The severe acute coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus that was first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-COV-2 virus are found in the nature of congenital coronaviruses, and outside the human body, the virus can be eradicated by domestic soap that dissolves its protective shell.
It is assumed to be of zoonic origin.
A genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoravirus, suburb of Sarbecovrus (cell line B) in conjunction with two other strains of bat viruses.
On a holistic-genomic level, it is 96% identical to other specimens of the coronavirus of the bat (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in the aminozurens of certain parts of the genome of pangolin viruses and human viruses.
A whole-genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest proportion of similarity (92%) is between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-COV-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it should eventually be confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PRR) of an infected secret or computer CT scan.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Uhan showed that the CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease current processes.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has issued a recommendation that “no CT be used to screen or test the first line in COVID-19.
WHO published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-COV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-CPR) is tested.
It can be performed on breathing and blood samples.
The results are usually available for a period of several hours to several days.
Usually, swab swab is used for the test, although swab can also be used; a number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had proved to be sufficiently accurate to obtain approval for universal application.
In the U.S., the Cellex serological test was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristics of the visualization of symptoms in X-rays and CTs include asymmetric peripheral disturbances of the type of matt glass and the absence of pleural effluents.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for drawing up an international database of confirmed infections.
Due to similarities with other infections, such as adenovirus, in the identification of COVID-19, photographs not supported by PCR tests have a limited clinical specificity.
In China, a major study was carried out comparing chest CT results and PCR testing and it was found that although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be deciphered more quickly; they were also more sensitive and therefore the diagnostic method could be considered a screening tool in the contaminated areas.
In order to diagnose the virus with X-rays and CT scans, an artificially based neural grid was developed.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintenance of general personal hygiene, washing of hands, avoiding touching of eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, use in coughing or sneezing of napkins, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that physical distance from people should be avoided, and many Governments recommend that any urgent visits to countries and areas affected by the outbreak should be avoided and that the movement of citizens should be restricted.
Nevertheless, the virus has spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading among populations whose members do not know where or how they have been infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for patients who may be infected should use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with other people and eye protection, and that contact tracking is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (Amnesty International), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring that this kind of surveillance be restricted.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working to develop solutions to ensure confidentiality of personal data, such as recording the user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he would be notified. There are also baseless versions of how to prevent infection - for example, nose and mouth stripping, which is actually ineffective.
So far, there is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on it.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends that hands with soap and water should be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or severe hand contamination, as well as before food, after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens up its protective casing.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of disinfectant for hand treatment on a alcohol-based basis of at least 60 per cent alcohol content.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated by a number of solutions (on the stainless steel surface, the disinfectant begins to operate a minute after application) with 62 to 71 per cent ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent isopropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent iodine.
Other components, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorgexide gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of suspicion of or confirmation of COVID in an institution such as an office or a day-to-day facility, all the spaces of such a facility, including rooms, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment such as tablets, sensor screens, keyboards, remote control and ATMs used by patients, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that the mouth and nose of the elbow or napkin should be covered with cough or sneeze and that the used hygiene items should be discarded immediately.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to use medical masks, as the use of the mask may limit the volume and range of exhalation products that dissipate in the air during conversation, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and touching the face with dirty hands is the main way of infection.” Masks are also recommended for those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are exposed to high risk, such as those who take care of a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of the mask does reduce the number of touches on the person.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC Centers, U.S.A., recommend wearing non-medical tissue facial masks, and China has singled out the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with other people (1 meters (3 feet) or less.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or public places.
Health officials in Thailand encourage people to make facial tissue masks in their homes and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going out without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government has required all visitors to the grocery store to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks were produced per day since mid-March, medical masks were prescribed for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were obliged to wear a medical mask while outside; those who could not buy masks were advised to sew them themselves in the home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Safeguards include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures to stay at home, limit travel, avoid crowded places, use non-contact greetings and physically distance themselves from others.
Many Governments in the regions, particularly those affected by the outbreak, now prescribe or recommend social distances.
The maximum number of people who can meet in one place, as recommended by U.S. government authorities and health-care organizations, has been rapidly reduced from 250 (in regions where data on the proliferation of COVID-19 was not available) to 50, and later to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two persons. The CDC recommends that older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of becoming seriously infected with the virus. The CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. In late March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term “social remoteness” with “physical remoteness”, thus clarifying the objective of this measure to reduce physical contact in social relations, whether through virtual communication or through physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be subjected to total social exclusion rather than remain in contact with others in alternative ways, and some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it was recommended that you only have sexual relations with your permanent partners with whom you live, and in whom you are confident that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are recommended for home-based self-insulation.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-insulation, and many Governments have also made mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas be placed in quarantine themselves.
The most stringent quarantine was ordered for persons at high risk.
Persons who may have been in contact with COVID-19 infected, or have recently visited a country or region significantly affected by the epidemic, were advised to be in quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat outbreaks include controlling, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and is intended to track and isolate the infected, and involves other measures of infectious control and vaccination to halt the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease can no longer be controlled, efforts are directed towards mitigation: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease can be pursued simultaneously.
The suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the equalization of the epidemic.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and allow more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, medical masks and self-insulation; social measures aimed at physical distances, such as school closures and mass cancellations; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and environmental protection measures such as surface cleaning; and, once the severity of the outbreak became apparent in China, more decisive action was taken to contain the outbreak, such as the isolation of entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries have also adopted a number of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced, as well as a referral system for the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected persons who were self-insulated and imposed heavy fines on those who had not done so.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has increased and the accumulation of excess stocks of medicines has been fined, and the British and U.S. modelling has shown that there are serious challenges to mitigation (delaying but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the increase of the epidemic).
Optimal policies to mitigate the impact of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3 and mortality by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Pressure may be preferable, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or as long as the vaccine is not developed, if sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has had social and economic costs.
There are currently no anti-viral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking unreceptive medicaments against cold, drinking enough liquid, and rest can help to alleviate the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection and respiratory support.
The use of steroid drugs can only be harmful.
Several compounds previously approved for other virus diseases are also being considered for use in COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic means” could alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and the adaptation of health care to patients with COVID-19 as the main response to an outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for primary health-care clinics and services to assist in the redistribution of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the elimination of non-immediate procedures, where possible, for the detection of the virus and the isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the expansion of intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the availability of HVF and beds.
There are different theories about where the very first case of infection may have occurred, the so-called “nil patient.”
The first known case of new coronavirus infection probably occurred on 1 December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The number of cases of coronavirus infection in Hubei province gradually increased during the month.
They were mainly related to the Juanan seafood wholesale market, where living animals were also sold, and one theory was that the virus was infiltrated by one of these animals; in other words, the virus was of zoonosis origin. On 26 December, a case of massive pneumonia was reported at Hubei County Hospital, with whom the doctor Zhang Tianjin worked, reporting the case to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Ouhan, on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the central clinic in Wuhan warned their colleagues about a “coronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlyan, were warned by the police of their responsibility for spreading false rumours, and the doctor, I Feng, received a reprimand from his superiors for raising panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Ouhan issued a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.
The Uhan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January, and at the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, thanks to Chinese New Year's holidays and the fact that Uhan is the transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already had symptoms of infection; as of 26 March, the United States had outpaced China and Italy in the largest number of confirmed cases worldwide; as of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 had died, and more than 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen zone have restricted their freedom of movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to control the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory stay at home, compulsory shelter or isolation) and curfews. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million were in isolation from the Philippines, about 59 million were in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later the figure rose to 2.6 billion, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Uhan on 1 December 2019; another report, whose credibility was not verified, reported on 17 November.
On 26 December, Zhang Jisian, a doctor, worked with a case of massive pneumonia of an unknown type, which was notified by her clinic on 27 December by the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Wuhan.
The initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, revealed the existence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Ouhan issued a public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In response to such notifications, the police alerted the doctors in Ouhan to the responsibility for “distribution of rumours” of the outbreak.
Originally, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no “probable evidence” of the ability of a newly discovered virus to transmit from man to man.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, later called China’s Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping’s “people’s war.”
Events of “the largest quarantine in the history of mankind” began to unfold, on 23 January the health border and the ban on entry to and from Wuhan were announced, and subsequently extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
In the city, the use of private transport was banned.
In many places, the celebrations of the Chinese New Year (25 January) were cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Huoshenshan, which was completed within 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leišenian, was built, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also reassigned 14 other institutions in Ouhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the period of celebration of the Chinese New Year.
Universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced remote working arrangements.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and outside Hubei Province.
The public transport schedule has been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
Many cities have introduced a regime for controlling the movement of citizens, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have faced some form of outdoor restrictions, and since the outbreak entered the global phase in March, China’s authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing introduced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city, and as of 23 March, only one case of intra-country transmission had been recorded in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of intra-country cases had largely been halted and the outbreak in China had been controlled.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei, other than Uhan, were lifted, two months after the closure of the province into quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with a visa or residence permit would be suspended as of 28 March.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on businesses and factories to resume work and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On 4 April, at 10 a.m., a national “minute of silence” was held, opening a day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus, announced by the State Council of the country and coincided with the Quinmin holiday, but the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the dead online, observing physical distances to avoid the re-emergence of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely because a large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji had gathered in Tegu.
Shincheonji's followers came to Tegu from Ouhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 (about 13 per cent) of the 9,336 church followers reported having symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea reported the highest level of alarm.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, and as early as 29 February, the figure rose to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers had been diagnosed with a virus.
The outbreak has affected the number of flights, so the flight schedule of airlines has been changed, and South Korea has launched a programme to screen the population for the presence of the virus, to monitor contacts and to arrange quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered the largest and best organization in the world.
Screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile application to all those who came from abroad, routine testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the following day, and increased testing capabilities, which allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.
South Korea’s programme is considered successful in fighting the outbreak of disease, despite the fact that entire cities have not been isolated, and South Korea’s society has initially been divided by President Mun Jae In’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for the Government ' s perceived inadequate response to the outbreak.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea recorded the lowest total number of infections in one day within four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed in a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on 1 April, 121 countries requested assistance in testing the virus in South Korea.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-COV-2 infection in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Health Education, two people died later the same day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sports activities, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but that only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
In March, plans were announced to limit intercity travel, but intensive movement between cities continued before the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrines in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020, and Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the background of allegations of concealment of the scale of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February more than 10 countries had linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the outbreaks there could be more severe than the 388 recorded by the Iranian Government by that date.
Iran’s parliament was closed down, and 23 of its 290 members were reported to be positive on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release all prisoners eligible for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons, where adequate medical care is lacking.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By March 23, 50 new cases of coronavirus were reported every hour in Iran and one new death every ten minutes from the coronavirus.
According to the WHO representative, the prevalence rate in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
The US sanctions against Iran are also expected to affect the country’s financial ability to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for the easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had entered Italy when two Chinese tourists had a positive impact on the SARS-COV-2 tests in Rome.
The number of infections has increased rapidly, prompting the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed in quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “The entry into and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as there had already been 100 deaths in Italy.
All major sporting events, including the A series, were scheduled to take place behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analysis, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIARTI) issued recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for the prioritization of medical care that may have to be used.
On 19 March, Italy surpassed China's death rate from the coronavirus, ranking first in the world, after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovery cases, most of them concentrated in the Lombardia region.
One CNN report notes that this high mortality rate in Italy can be facilitated by a combination of two factors — a large number of older citizens in Italy and a lack of capacity to examine all who are currently suffering from coronavirus.
The United Kingdom had responded to the virus most calmly in all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government had not obliged citizens to observe any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not responding quickly and seriously to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all unimportant travel and social contacts should be avoided, inviting people to work from home to the extent possible and to avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised workers to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than Pound2,500 per month, as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter measures for social distances, prohibiting more than two persons from gathering and limiting travel and active rest in the outdoors to cases of extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by police, fines and crowds.
Most enterprises have been ordered to close, with the exception of those that provide “life for the population”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business stores, fuel stations and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading U.S. government public health organization, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, testing of the population in the United States was not immediately initiated, and the true incidence of the outbreak during this period has been hidden.
Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, by the absence of authorization by the Federal Government before the end of February to use non-State test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, and by restrictive criteria before the beginning of March, which would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done for the appointment of a medical practitioner).
The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been carried out in the United States by 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been carried out by March 13.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: “Many patients, even with symptoms and appointment of a doctor, were waiting to be tested for hours or days.” After the first death from a coronavirus in the United States was reported from Washington State on February 29, Governor Jay Insley announced a state of emergency, which was also announced shortly by other states.
On March 3, Seattle schools were cancelled, and by mid-March, schools were closed all over the country. On March 6, 2020, a group of Epidemiologists from the Imperial College, London, informed the United States of the forecasts of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Anti-Coronavirus Readiness and Response Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency assistance to the federal authorities to respond to the outbreak.
Corporations imposed travel restrictions on staff members, cancelled conferences and encouraged staff to work from home.
Sports events and seasons were cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions to most of Europe, with the exception of Britain, for 30 days starting March 13.
The next day, he extended the restrictions to include Britain and Ireland as well.
On 13 March, the President declared a state of emergency in the country, allowing federal funds to be used to deal with the crisis.
Since March 15, many companies have started to close or shorten their working hours throughout the United States, helping to combat the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On 23 March, 10,700 cases were reported in New York in a 24-hour period, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On 25 March, the Governor said that social distance was likely to be an effective measure, as estimates of the doubling of cases fell from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, 32,308 cases were reported in New York and 672 persons died, and more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States on 26 March than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy, and as of 8 April, 400,335 cases were confirmed in the United States of America, while 12,841 died.

On the same day, the USNS Comfort hospital ship was fixed at the port of New York for 1,000 beds.
On April 3, 884 deaths from coronavirus were recorded in the United States within 24 hours.
In the state of New York, on 3 April, the number of cases exceeded 100,000, and the White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring information entering the public domain through the office of Vice-President Mike Pence, monitoring public statements and publications of health officials and scientists related to the virus.
Generally speaking, President Trump ' s supporters shared their views on how successful he was in dealing with the crisis.
Some officials and observers criticized the US’s dependence on imports of essential materials, including essentials, from China.
In mid-January 2020, the Travel Medicine magazine published an analysis of air travel patterns, which was used to map and predict spread models.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of travelers from Uhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist destinations, Bali has been identified as the least prepared for outbreak, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared. Australia adopted its emergency plan for the new coronavirus (COVID-19) on 7 February.
In this regard, it is stated that much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will pay special attention to border control and communications in a threat situation.
On 21 March, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.
Thanks to effective quarantine measures in the public transport sector in Uhan and Hubei, some countries planned to evacuate their nationals and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights by their home countries, to which the Chinese authorities had granted permission.

On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate U.S. citizens on board a cruise ship, Diamond Princess.
On 21 February, a plane with 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Brilliant Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian Government began to evacuate its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways aircraft chartered by the South African Government flew with 112 South African nationals.
Prior to the flight, a medical examination of passengers was carried out, and four South Africans found to have signs of coronavirus were left in China to reduce risk.
Only South Africans with negative tests on the coronavirus were evacuated.
The tests were taken from all South African citizens, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers who participated in the humanitarian mission, and they were all monitored and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort as a precaution.
On March 20, the United States began to withdraw in part from Iraq in response to the pandemic.

Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to be distributed by the organization to its States Parties.
Later, he also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks and 5 IVL devices to Panama.
The Czech Republic, Georgia, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey also donated medicines to Canada, and expressed concern about medical masks and testing kits for Chinese production.
Spain, for example, withdrew 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits with accuracy of only 30 per cent, while the Netherlands withdrew 600,000 missing Chinese medical masks.

On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency relief operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of infection.
WHO noted that there were clear differences between the pattern of pneumonia outbreak in 2002-2004, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of seizing information, which allegedly prevented prevention and control of the spread of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central Government “regulously provided updated information on the situation to avoid panic on the eve of China's New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban transport in Uhan, the WHO representative, Goden Galea, noted that, although “this measure was certainly not recommended by WHO”, it was also a “very important demonstration of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the most common site” and described it as “unprecedent in public health history.” On 30 January, after the confirmation of the ability to transmit infection from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of infected people in other countries, WHO declared an international public health emergency (PHEIC) which was the sixth time it was first introduced during a pig flu pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, said that the announcement of PHEIC was due to “the rapid global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to provide $675 million in strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need for urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the measure of our readiness is the level of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest” and called on the international community to “make the choice of investing today or paying for the future.” At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide a “potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem.”
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Team has been established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO states, will “concentrate on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to combat the outbreak in a broader social and economic context”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc team, which provided international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in internal management and assessment of the “seriousness of the disease and its contagion”, organized seminars and meetings with key national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of the response at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that “it is too early to call the disease a pandemic, but countries must nevertheless be prepared to do so”.
When the outbreak erupted in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the probability of the global spread of the coronavirus would be increased from “high” to “very high” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, warned in his statement, “It is a test of every government on the planet's preparedness for reality: it's time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared,” and stressed that the right response can help the world avoid the “worst scenario.”
Ryan also stated that current data did not justify the declaration of the global pandemic by public health officials, and added that the announcement of the pandemic would mean that “we are in fact recognizing that everyone on the planet would be at risk of contracting the virus.”
On March 11, WHO declared the outbreak of the coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO “is deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on the problem.” WHO is severely criticized for the perceived inadequate approach to the concept of pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the current situation, Mr. Tedros Adanam, Director-General of WHO, was petitioned to resign, signed by 733,000 as of 6 April.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to take life-saving measures against him and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and recommendations.
The digital hub provides information on the policy measures of different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonara, for its efforts to combat the pandemic, which began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the provincial level have been dismissed for the quarantine measures they have taken in central China, and these dismissals have shown dissatisfaction with the response of the political establishment to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect China’s Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger over the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the outbreak of the coronavirus had begun in Uhan, but took a side to the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the US or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration called the coronavirus the “China virus” or the “Uhan virus”, stating that “censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus, which has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement was criticized by some commentators, who claim that such an approach is racist and “distracts from the inability of the U.S. President’s administration to control the spread of the disease.”
The Daily Beast has access to a U.S. government telegram that contains a communications strategic trick, apparently invented by the National Security Council, with the following references to strategy: “It's all in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television speeches.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of the “advocative pressure” to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitic component that includes the struggle for influence through the PR and the so-called policy of generosity.”
Borrell also stated that “China persists in promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, as opposed to the US.”
China also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some reports of aid being sent to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned in connection with the US sanctions imposed on April 3.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of redirecting aid intended for other countries to their own country.
Other countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy also had disputes over medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has taken over hundreds of SVL vehicles destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the EU, said that “China alone responded bilaterally.
This clearly does not reflect European solidarity.”
On March 22, following a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for Russian military nurses, specialized disinfectant transport and other medical equipment to be sent to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source” claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “unhelpful or of little use to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on world public opinion at the “geopolitic and diplomatic” level.
President Attillo Fontana of Lombardia and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected the media attacks and expressed their gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The Spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, stated that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they will also be able to respond if necessary.”
NATO Defence 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the cold war — will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 (Protector 2020) exercise: “In the current public health crisis, these exercises endanger not only the lives of the US military and many European participating countries, but also the people of the countries in which such activities are to take place.” Iran’s government has been severely affected by the virus; about two dozen members of Parliament have been infected, as well as 15 other current or former politicians.
On 14 March 2020, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani, in an open letter, asked world leaders for help, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets owing to the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran, and the epidemic had led to calls for the adoption of social policies in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified health and childcare system, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Politologists expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, and the pandemic has made diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worse.
South Korea criticized Japan's “undefined and passive quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any South Korean citizen would be placed in a two-week quarantine in government-specific locations.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-jin's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for the Government ' s perceived inadequate response to the outbreak of the disease, and the pandemic forced countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Victor Orban the indefinite power to govern by decrees, to suspend the functioning of Parliament, and to hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fake information about the virus and on government measures to deal with the crisis.
The outbreak of the coronavirus was cited as the cause of several supply shortfalls owing to the global increase in the use of anti-emergency equipment, the acquisition of goods in panic situations and disruptions in production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings of a shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased demand for and disruption of suppliers.
There were also panic shopping in several localities, which resulted in the disappearance of essential goods, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which in turn resulted in a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanam, the demand for personal protection has increased 100 times.
This leap has resulted in a 20-fold increase in prices over the normal price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment around the world, and WHO warned that health workers would be at risk for that reason.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, the Daigo buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities have resulted in a lack of infant food in some supermarkets and were subsequently banned by the Australian Government, despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in North Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, acute food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation and illicit trade of critically important products, which have proved successful, have averted the severe food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
North Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but the industry believes that agricultural prices can rise.
Food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork supplies to ensure that the population was well fed.
Similar laws require food producers to conserve food supplies in case of emergency also exist in Italy.
The damage to the world economy has affected China: according to media reports of 16 March, China’s economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to combat the spread of the virus, which have reduced retail sales by 20.5 per cent.
Mainland China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, a virus outbreak is considered to be a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agatha Demarai, a member of the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that market volatility will continue until the potential results become clearer.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could exceed the effects of the 2002-2004 SAR epidemic.
According to an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis, the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last for up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have begun to take “emergency measures” following a sharp fall in oil prices due to a fall in demand from China.
On February 24, world stock markets collapsed because of a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, because of growing concerns about the outbreak of the coronavirus, various US stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones for industrial companies, have shown the sharpest fall since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1,191 points, the largest one-day fall since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10 per cent drop.
On February 28, Scape Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The stock fell again because of concerns about the proliferation of the coronavirus, and the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.
The economist Mohamed El Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks react faster than in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in relation to travel bans, closures of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendation of Governments not to make any travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines have cancelled flights owing to a sharp decline in the demand for airline tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe has ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise industry has proved to be more powerful than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of events involving a large number of people, including the annual New Year's Festivals; private companies have also closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.
Many New Year ' s events had been cancelled and tourist attractions had been closed in order to prevent mass crowds; for example, Beijing had closed the Holy City and abolished traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and districts of China, the authorities extended the New Year ' s holiday until 10 February, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities have increased their response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year's celebrations, and the retail sector has suffered globally: shop hours have been reduced and some stores have been temporarily closed.
Visits to retail points in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
The retailers in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, the attendance of shopping centres fell by 33-43 per cent in March, compared to February.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that a recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic may leave between 14 and 22 million more people behind poverty than it would in a similar situation but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Ouhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their own country or locked up in Hubei Province, and in March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought the help of the Government.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that in the United States, the outbreak of coronavirus could deprive 47 million people of jobs and unemployment could reach 32 per cent. Self-insulation measures introduced in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed on a daily basis. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44 per cent of Canadian households were in some way unemployed. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, while 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit; almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their employees to government-subsidized reduced working hours — part-time.
The German part-time wage scheme has also been introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often publicly funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, if possible, supporting the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed down for an indefinite period, or had been restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances had been cancelled or postponed to other dates.
In return, extensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered disruptions, and the Vatican announced the cancellation of the Festival of the Good Week in Rome, which is being held during the last week of the Christian repentant period, the Great Post.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services have begun broadcasting on radio, live or television, while some church leaders have offered to perform outdoor worship.
The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closed down its churches, chapels and St. Peter’s Square, where Christian pilgrims have not yet appeared, and later other religious organizations have also abolished worship and restricted access to public worship in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourbarians.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the Coronavirus and the holy sites were later closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited foreign pilgrims and its own residents from entering the Holy Places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most of the major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA League of Champions 2019-20, the 2019-20 Premier League, the Euro-2020 UEFA, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak of the Coronavirus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “post 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021.” The casino and other gambling institutions around the world were closed down, and poker tournaments, which were usually broadcast live, were either postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to go online, and many gaming sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also suffered because various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, have also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, organizing live web concerts or web festivals; this helps people in creative professions to continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
There's a lot of internet memos on the subject of the coronavirus online, many of which are humorous and smoothing down the anxiety of periods of uncertainty.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as against people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
Information reports for February (when most cases of infection were still confined to China) revealed racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retribution for anything.
Anti-Chinese sentiments are also growing in some African countries.
Many residents of Ouhan and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Support was provided to Chinese citizens, as well as those living in virus-affected areas, both offline and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, and citizens of such regions may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia, and citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed a petition at an early stage, insisting on prohibiting Chinese nationals from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComToJapan (#Chinese Don't Come Japan) took the lead on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report a growing level of racist sentiments and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus “the Chinese virus”; critics consider this to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Uhan to the New Sanjara.
Students coming from north-eastern India bordering China and studying in the large cities of India reported cases of persecution related to the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Dileep Ghosh, President of the State Division of Bharatiya Janata Party, Western Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “so God had avenged them.”
These remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them “misguided.” In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents resurfaced as “foreign garbage” and “retirement” objects.
Many newspapers with paid access to information removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made available their scientific articles on the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to their research results on the printers' publications servers, such as biRxiv.

Laboratory testing of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-COV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the OTCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect the SARS-COV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
Antibodies detection (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.
Tests on antibodies reveal the number of people who have suffered from the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated in the hospital or not at all.
The exact mortality rate from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests carried out in different countries was very contradictory.
Such data differences are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
A polymeraceous chain reaction of real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) can be performed on airway samples obtained in various ways, including swab swab or wet sample.
The results are usually available for a period of several hours to two days.
The OT-PCR test carried out on smears taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, but it continues to breed in the lungs.
Infected patients tested in the second week of the disease may alternatively take material from the lower respiratory pathways by sucking catheter, or use refreshment products (nail).
An early PCR test was developed at the Sharite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis for 250,000 sets, which were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-COV-2 detection kit based on the PCR at the clinical level (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It detects the "E" gene common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the "RdRp" gene specific to SARS-COV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group is one of the first companies to obtain permission from China's National Drug Administration to use the SARS-COV-2 detection kit on the basis of PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnostic panel for RT-PR in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from older versions of test sets produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow area of testing by CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and only after that date were State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
Testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency application permit, and US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 on the basis of RT-PRCs throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing on COVID-19 throughout the country on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been declared; the sampling and processing of the analyses should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Research Centre for virology and Biotechnology “VECTOR”.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service, and it was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA to use a test that can be performed within 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application permit (EUA) to Abbott laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; previously the FDA issued a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for a test of about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses amplification technology for insulated nucleic acids instead of the PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternate temperatures, it can produce positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott is planning to increase production to 50,000 tests per day, and Taiwan is currently developing a monoclonal antibody test that is uniquely linked to the nucleocapsid protein (N-squirrel) of the new coronavirus, and it is hoped that it will be possible to produce results in 15 to 20 minutes, like the flu express test.
A study of specialized literature in March 2020 concluded that “breast cell rentgenograms have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while the results of CT [computer tomography] may be of such value even before symptoms occur”.
Typical signs identified during the CT include bilateral multi-pillar sub-plural seals of the "matter glass" type with peripheral, asymmetrical and a posterior distribution.
Sub-plural dominance, the symptom of rocky bridges, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Uhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that the CT was much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincided with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has issued a recommendation that “no CT be used to screen or test the first line in COVID-19.” As of March 2020, it is the PCR method that is recommended for initial CDC screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is to produce antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to carry out population control, and can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by in situ diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-productivity automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT usually uses one sample of peripheral blood, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
At the PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by piercing each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood sampling phase is not required. On March 26, 2020, the FDA identified 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and can now extend their tests to antibodies.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA had approved only one emergency application test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits to use their test kits, which can be detected in the blood samples of IgG and IgA antibodies.
The test output is several hundred samples over several hours and therefore the method works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of the viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection; early in April, Britain found that none of the antibodies test kits it had acquired were satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspicion of the virus to stay at home: “Emergency officers hand over a sample tube to the patient”, the patient spits into it, gives it back and receives the results of the test some time later. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases in the home, which eliminates the risk of infection by the patient of other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it is used to transport the patient. During the emergency test on COVID-19, a medical officer takes the analysis in suspicious cases using all appropriate precautions.
Express testing centres helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures in any other country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors stated that they were ready to do about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient conditions, and a week earlier they could only do 10,700 tests a week.
If the examination is appointed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the President of the Institute, Robert Koch, Germany's overall testing capacity is 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, rapid testing had been proposed in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was not known, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of calendar week 12/200, a total of at least 483,295 tests were taken on SARS-COV-2, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33,491 (6.9 per cent) samples were positive. Researchers at the Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Uhan, a 2,000-kw meters emergency laboratory called Huo-Yang (Chinese or Fire Eye) was opened by BGI on 5 February 2020, which could handle more than 10,000 samples a day.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by the founder of the BGI Van Jiang and completed in just five days; the simulation showed that if the laboratory had not been put into service at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher, and consequently quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
The Huo-Yang laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened after the opening of the laboratory in Uhan, in a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day, and open multiplex Origami Assays were released, which can test up to 1,122 COVID19 tests using only 93 tests, and these balanced designs can work in small laboratories, excluding robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to a shortage of reagents, mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States became problematic.
As a result, some authors have referred to test sample treatment protocols, which provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) within 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the amount of testing for the coronavirus currently being conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita was higher than that of any other country and that a large proportion of the population would soon be tested.
This was the result of rapid testing opportunities, along with the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yang emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PRC tests per day and is the world's first laboratory of such a large scale operating outside China.
Various testing options for different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of test kits, which are sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Sanitary Epidemiology Centers was not available until January 28, which resulted in the absence of test kits in the U.S.; at the start of the outbreak, China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test kits, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient sets recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts say that the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has worked to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many of the United States private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of tests, were overburdened and stocks of swab and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by CDC had “disadvantages”, and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private development of the tests, and Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese firm Schenzen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these sets were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the inaccuracy of the results could be caused by poor sampling or misuse of sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the incorrect sets and replace them with other sets, the Shenzhen Bioeasy sets. 80 per cent of the test kits that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had yielded incorrect results. The 1.2 million test kits acquired by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović suggested that they should be dropped to the Danube. Atesh Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had “high errors” and the Ministry “not used them.” The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was declared unfit for use.
Quarantine measures for those whose tests had been positive on SARS-COV-2, as well as surveillance of the people with whom such patients had been in contact, had had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where COVID-19 died for the first time in Italy, conducted two test cycles for the total population of about 3,400 people, at intervals of about 10 days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were placed in quarantine.
The entry into the locality had been closed, and the measure had completely stopped the spread of the infection.
With intensive contact monitoring, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries, and extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and shops had not been imposed.
Many activities were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore urged residents to stay at home, but schools that ended on 23 March opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also coped with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions have been less aggressive.
A statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were carried out than deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because they were able to identify more patients with low or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative test results to COVID-19 in one of the 16 WHO monitoring laboratories for validation testing.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America, and one in Australia.
In the next graph, the column values of the `positive results' depend on a country-specific test policy.
A country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher rate of success than a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, all the other conditions being equal.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygienic, is a process of cleaning hands to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted in a fecal-oral manner.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common cold, for example, if he touches the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous skins) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, after which hands should be washed with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the patient's care procedures.
After changing diapers or washing a baby to the bathroom.
After sniffing, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, feeds or wastes of animal origin.
Hand hygiene refers to hygiene related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before taking drugs or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The primary medical goal of hand was to clean up the hands of pathogens (bacteries, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing disease) and chemicals that could be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Handwashing is very healthy: for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the rate of infant mortality in domestic births.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by taking advantage of simple habits such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure has the potential to reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income regions.
A 48% reduction in the number of cases of diarrhoea may be related to the washing of hands with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (PRSs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in each house, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of the SRI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia in general kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children’s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after food, which has become a solid habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce mortality from diarrhoea by almost half, and death from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also prevents impetigo – a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A slight negative effect of frequent washing of hands is that it can lead to drying of the skin and, in the event, to damage to it.
A 2012 Danish study found that too often washing of hands can lead to a skin jaw and skin bleakness – a disease known as eczema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too frequent washing of hands can also be considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal oral transmission of the disease: after discharge (feeding, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (change of diapers), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after treatment of the cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or shrivelling, after contacting the waste of animal origin or animals, after contacting the garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is not very common.
A 2015 study on hand washing in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7 per cent of families had used hand washing with soap. A 2014 study found that the highest, 97 per cent, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the US on the list was close to the middle, 77 per cent; the lowest was found in China at 23 per cent. There are currently several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group hands washing from schoolchildren at the scheduled time of the day is one such methodology that helps to train children to do so.
The “Emergency Health Care Programme”, implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale interventions to improve child health and education.
The national programme is based on deworming, which is conducted twice a year, as well as daily soap and fluorine teeth cleaning.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from skin covers is more effective if soap or cleaning materials are added during the washing process.
The main action of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and to raise the level of solubility.
Water itself is not considered an effective instrument for skin purification, as the fats and proteins that are components of organic pollution are poorly dissolved in water.
Sufficient water, however, contributes to the process of purification.
Solid soap, because of repeated use, may also contain bacteria that can be found on the previous use.
A small amount of research into the skin cover of bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap suggests that this is unlikely to occur because bacteria are washed away from the foam.
The CDC continues to argue that “liquid soap with a hand-dosing device is the preferred option for washing hands”.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence of the fact that the use of recommended anti-septic or disinfectant substances has selective effects on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by their nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclozane, to which many resistance strains of organisms are persistent.
Thus, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not selective against antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may be inconsistent with the advertising.
In addition to the surface-activated substance and skin protection, complex compounds may contain acids (acetic, ascorbinic, dairy) as a controller for pH, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other excreta (alone faith, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). An integrated analysis by the Public Health School of the University of Oregon has shown that, in terms of disease prevention and removal of bacteria from the skin, simple varieties of soap are as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclozane.
Hot water is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37 °C.
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold to remove natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria.
Contrary to popular opinion, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial pressure on the hands.
Hand disinfectant (sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a hand-hygienic without water.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, the use of non-water hand-hygienic means (also known as disinfectant hands-on-alcohol, anti-septic devices for disinfecting hands or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these products are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, with the addition of sealants such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or humidifiers such as glycerine in liquid or foam form, which makes it easier to use these devices and reduce the effects of the drying of the skin by alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity, and disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectant products kill bacteria, including bacteria with multiple drug resistance (MRSA and VRE), a tuberculosis stick, as well as certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectant substances containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (the 3.5 reduction log is similar to 35 decibel) on their arms 30 seconds after use and 99.99% – 99.999% (the 4-5 reduction logarithm) on their hands 1 minute after use. Hand disinfectants are most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectant is virtually inefficient against viruses of the noroviral (or Norwalk) type, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient amounts of antiseptic or alcohol-containing drugs must be used to thoroughly treat and saturate the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and back surface of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers over the entire length of the fingers, shall be spread for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing to wash hands rather than use disinfectants, especially when the hands are heavily polluted.
The growing popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of hand disinfectant on a alcohol basis may cause skin dryness if their composition does not contain softening agents and (or) skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and (or) other softening substances to the ingredient.
In clinical trials, hand disinfectants containing softening components caused much less irritation and dry skin than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact sprinkler syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually non-existent.
The lower probability of irritating contact dermatitis has become a factor in the choice of disinfectant compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water means do not clean their hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that disinfectant hands are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as conventional soap and water, as the use of such devices still leaves pathogenic microorganisms in their hands.
The efficiency of the disinfectant for non-alcohol hands depends to a large extent on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than in alcohol or alcohol-containing substances.
Most recently, it has been shown that the drugs that use benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, as opposed to alcohol, which has been proven to be ineffective after multiple use, probably due to progressive by-product skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ashes or clay.
Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, the ash is a disinfectant, as it forms a alkaline solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend the use of hand-washing techniques, which include the following steps:
Spread your hands under warm or cold flowing water.
It is the running water that is recommended because standing water can be polluted, but the temperature of water is irrelevant.
Wash your hands with a large amount of soap, including the back of your hands, as well as areas between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that when soap is used (not just one water), people tend to wash their hands more carefully.
Trim your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Training helps to remove germs from your skin, and the longer you do so, the more germs are removed.
Spread your hands carefully under flowing water.
Handwashing in standing water can cause recontamination.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry themselves.
Wet and wet hands are more easily polluted, and most often people ignore areas such as the thumb, wrist, between their fingers and under their fingernails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that moisturizing lotion be used to prevent the drying of the skin of the hands, which could cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If current water and soap are not available, there are a variety of inexpensive ways to wash hands: water from a hanging jerrican or a bottleneck with holes and (or) the use of ash, if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. Water-saving solutions, such as foot taps and other low-cost options, exist in areas with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries).
A foot - pedal crane is a simple design consisting of a vessel suspended on a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to get water on its hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand-drying is an integral part of the hand-hygienic process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Growing research shows that paper towels are much hygienicer than electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was carried out by the University of Westminster in London, sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Servants and Towels, to compare the hygienicity of paper towels, hand dryers with warmer air and more modern air dryers for hands.
It was found that after washing and drying the hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the fingers was an average increase of 194 per cent and 254 per cent on the palms.
It also turns out that after washing and drying the hands in the airflow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increases by 42%, and in the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips is on average reduced to 76 per cent and on the palms to 77 per cent. Scientists have also tested the possibility of cross-infecting several visitors to toilet rooms and toilet environments at each type of drying.
A stroke-air dryer, which releases 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h), is capable of blowing micro-organisms out of his own unit and potentially infecting other users of the toilet and toilet within a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
No significant microorganisms were detected using paper towels, and TUV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study in 2005 to evaluate various methods of hand-drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of hand-drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to dry paper towels.
Hand-cleaning with disinfectant napkins can be an alternative to travel without soap and water.
Hand disinfectant on a alcohol basis shall contain at least 60 per cent alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignatz Semmelweis found it to be highly effective (in 1846) in the prevention of disease in stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget it.
According to one study, the use of such devices does help to reduce infection.
Medical washing of hands lasts at least 15 seconds, and a large amount of soap, water or gel is used to wash and wash each part of the hand.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other by crossing their fingers.
If there's dirt under your fingernails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water on their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them with clean towels.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to close the crane and, if necessary, close and open any door.
This prevents re-pollutation of hands from these surfaces.
The goal of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“microbes”) and to prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the flow of catheter-related blood by 66 per cent, and the World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard hand-washing and hand-treatment procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and open to public discussion.
The review was co-sponsored by Whitby.
If proof of compliance is required, commercial devices may be used to measure and verify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization refers to “five points” when it is necessary to wash hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before the use of antiseptics, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap in hand-washing ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such anti-bacterial properties may be necessary before performing surgery or in a highly antibiotic resistant environment. The “cleaning” of hands before surgery requires a crane that can be turned on and off without touching it; a little chlor-hexidine or ion water should also be used to wash hands, sterile hand-washing towels, a sterile friction brush and another sterile instrument to clean under the fingernails.
All jewellery must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for two to six minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands too long, like 10 minutes.
During the stripping, the water with the forearm must not fall back on the wrists of the hands.
After the washing, the hands are dried with sterile tissue and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use antiseptic handwork before and after care procedures.
In order to combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of washing was the most beneficial and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the hand washing rate was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared with the washing of antibacterial soap, hand washing with conventional soap results in more than three times the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food, comparing hand washing with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, on average 30 seconds per procedure, showed that hand treatment with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand alcohol solutions in reducing the number of A H1N1 flu virus and the Clostridium Diphphylium dispute. Hand-hygienic development activities in health facilities may include training in hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-containing hand solutions, and written and oral reminders to staff about the need to wash their hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective types of interventions in the various health facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered cost-effective and important for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to develop a habit of regularly washing hands.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand-washing cranes are not available in every private or public toilet, although there are cheap ways of doing hand-washing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits rather than by lack of soap or water.
Promotion and encouragement of hand-washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
Monitoring and evaluation of results are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve the situation of hand hygiene in lower-middle-income countries, there is effective community-based health and epidemic surveillance, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of advocacy on hand-washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's "Three Star Approach" approach: it promotes simple cost-effective measures in schools to encourage pupils to wash their hands using soap as well as other hygiene requirements.
By meeting minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
Handwashing is one of the possible measures implemented through the hands-hygienic information campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
Global Handwashing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour, and as a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of emojis that symbolize hand washing.
Some studies examined the overall efficiency of hand washing in developing countries as compared to DALYs (maintained years of life without disabilities).
However, one study suggests that the incentive to wash hands with soap is a much more economical solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for vulnerable groups such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid-19th century as two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), an English nurse and “the founder of modern care.”
At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by rotting smells called myasms.
In the 1980s, as a result of outbreaks of diseases that spread through the digestive tract and health-related infections, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent infection.
As a result of the outbreak of pork flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with “good hand-washing techniques” were posted in public toilets, as well as in office and airport toilets.
The phrase “give your hands” is a manifestation of your reluctance to accept responsibility for anything or to be a participant in anything.
It is derived from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate was “smarting his hands ” when deciding to crucify Jesus Christ; it was later used more widely in some English communities.
In the play "Macbeth" of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands unwittingly in an attempt to cleanse the imaginary blemish that symbolizes an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes that she committed herself and prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who remember or observe an unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than others, and handwashers are more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have been able to wash their hands after what they have seen will participate in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as volunteer activities.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning; the symbolic washing of hands with water but without soap is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Woodhu in Islam; and religion also prescribes the hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19 involves the application of occupational safety and health techniques to control risk and control the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk management depends on location and work, based on risk assessment, community severity and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) reported that posts with lower risk levels have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand-washing, incentives for workers to stay at home for signs of illness, respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis but are likely to be infected because of the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include workers in contact with the public, for example in schools, a highly densely populated working environment and some large retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic preventive measures, include airborne air filters, protective screens and accessible personal protections in the event of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health-care and morgue staff who have been in contact with a person with confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 infection are classified as high-risk, with the risk being increased to very high levels in aerosol-related procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such personnel include the use of engineering safety equipment, such as negative pressure venting rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
An outbreak of COVID-19 may have different effects at the workplace.
Employees may be absent from the workplace because of their own illness, the need to care for others or the fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns may vary in terms of both the types of goods for which demand is available and the ways in which such goods are purchased (e.g., purchases in non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Plan for Epidemic Preparedness and Response can be used to provide protection.
The plans address the risks associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising at home and in communities, as well as the risk factors of individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also identify the monitoring tools needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise from the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the goals of responding to the epidemic: reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses are affected by the severity of disease in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such tools according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be addressed, the most effective means of safety are engineering, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Engineering security means that employees are isolated from work-related risk areas and do not rely on employee behaviour, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures requiring action by the employee or employee.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to address certain risks.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected according to the threat to the employee, be of a size (e.g. respiratory) and be used continuously and properly, regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly filmed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Office of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) believes that the lowest-risk positions have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic responses to the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with respiratory etiquette, including hand-coughing and sneezing, provision of napkins and garbage containers, preparedness for remote or replacement work, as appropriate, for workers to avoid other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected persons is a critical step for the protection of workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff with acute respiratory symptoms stay at home until the heat stops, no elevated body temperature, and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using heat-resistant or other symptoms-free drugs, and also require flexibility in hospital leaf policy, allowing staff to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and ensuring that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but are likely to be infected by SARS-COV-2 due to the spread of the disease in society in the area where the business is located, or in connection with the recent visits of such person to the locations where COVID-19 is spread.
These categories include workers with high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers, such as transparent plastic protection screens, and the installation of windows for customer services without exiting the vehicle. Administrative measures for such a group and higher-risk groups include recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, replacement of personal meetings for virtual communication, scheduling, discontinuance of non-critical trips to COVID-19 sites, development of emergency communication plans, including a forum for responding to stressful workers, provision of relevant training for workers on COVID-19 risk factors and protection measures, training of workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, correct use of such tools, provision of resources and work environment conducive to personal hygiene, regular hand washing requirements, limiting access to workplaces, including personal and public safety nets, provision of protective clothing and other protective measures.
In rare cases, workers at such risk may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick in a plane, measures such as the isolation of a sick person from other people for a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of a crew member to care for the sick person, the provision of a mask to the sick person or the request to the person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin or sneeze are required to ensure the safety of workers and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protection if the patient has a fever, a regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected; in cases of commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, safety measures include the postponement of travel in the event of illness, self-insulation and immediate notification of the medical centre on board a ship in the event of heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should be carried out in such a person ' s isolation room; in the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average infection rate in the community, social distance strategies can be introduced, such as the cancellation of exits for personal meetings, gatherings and other mass events, such as physical exercise or choir singing, taking food in cafeterias, increasing the distance between the parties, regulating the time of arrival and care, limiting insignificant visits, and the use of a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of proliferation in the community, in addition to social distance strategies, long-term non-attendance measures may be considered; for law enforcement officials who perform daily duties, the immediate risk to health is considered to be low, according to CDC.
Law enforcement officials who are obliged to contact persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 contamination are encouraged to follow the same instructions as are prescribed for ambulance paramedics, including the use of suitable personal protections.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers are required to clean and disinfect their uniforms and equipment before reuse by household cleaning aerosols or by anti-handling, to comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the disposal of used personal protective equipment, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who contact patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection in their aerosol-related procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 contamination.
The procedures followed by the formation of aerosols include sounding, coughing, bronchoscopying, some dental procedures and examinations or collection of samples by invasive methods.
The staff of the morgues at high risk are those who handle the bodies of persons with confirmed illness or suspected COVID-19 contamination at the time of their death; if they do an autopsy, they become highly risky. Additional engineering equipment for such risk groups includes the use of insulated rooms for patients with confirmed illness or suspicion of COVID-19, including in aerosol-related procedures.
In some health facilities and morgues, the use of special, negative-pressure ventilation can be an effective measure.
Samples should be treated in accordance with the precautions for biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients should be distributed to distinct waiting areas depending on suspected COVID-19 contamination. In addition to other personal protection devices, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers who interact at a distance of up to 6 feet with confirmed patients or suspected of infection with SARS-COV-2, as well as for persons conducting aerosol-related procedures.
In the U.S., NIOSH approved respirators for a person with a N95 or higher filter need to be used as part of a comprehensive written programme on respiratory protection, which specifies the requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort to the staff member; WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for personnel performing screening at the patient reception point.
WHO recommends that persons collecting samples from the respiratory paths of patients with COVID-19 or the vectors of the disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation should wear a surgical mask, protective glasses or face shield, robe and gloves.
In the course of the procedures followed by the formation of aerosol, the respirator N95 or FFP2 should be worn instead of the surgical mask.
Given the insufficient availability of personal protection equipment worldwide, WHO recommends that the need for such protection be minimized by the use of remote medicine, physical barriers such as so transparent windows, access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of personal protection equipment only necessary for a specific purpose, the prolonged use of the same respirator without removing, in dealing with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection and the recommendation not to use masks for persons without symptoms.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Facilitation and preparation for the future
DATE/DEVICE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
PREVENTIONS: CC0: No protected rights
This month, we are living under unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interconnection of people around the world and our responsibilities to each other.
We have had no precedents for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen friendly and caring relationships among all our colleagues, as reflected in e-mails, calls, and chat rooms — a remarkable demonstration of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people are working with us.
I speak with great gratitude and pride of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the appreciation of our work.
I've been reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to approach Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And that's possible thanks to your work, whether it's about making websites work, paying our colleagues, or protecting community security.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and this is even more important today than ever before.
At a time like this, not only what we do, but how we do it, is important to achieve meaningful results for the world.
Given the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way we work together, starting with the coming week.
Adjusting our working order and timetables
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
In the course of our communication, we considered our ideas for the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to ease the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, then let it be.
For all personnel, contractors and non-staff personnel:
We expect that it will take about four hours a day or 20 hours a week before further orders are received.
We don't announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, it's allowed for our mission.
But the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether you care for your family, buy food or go to a doctor's office, your well-being is our number one priority.
We're not following your working time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't be working.
That is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
There is no need to make a sick leave or a day off: simply inform your supervisor and help the team to review the calendar and schedule to ensure coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation).
The hourly rates will be fully paid.
We have already announced and confirmed our intention to honour our obligations to our contractors and staff with an hourly rate of payment.
Each person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This involves, in particular, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll back you up.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can yield remarkable results, especially in times like this.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (including others) teams perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and to shift the focus to support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we're just focusing on the most important projects.
The slowdown today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “two more to catch up” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not be required to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new targets and timetables, if possible.
What's going on with the APP (annual plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the time frame for the implementation of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose an extension of time for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will enable staff to prioritize critical work, self-help and caring for loved ones, while all who need or want to work will be given a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions across the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, provide representatives and teams with relevant information on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
Thank the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an anti-viral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used antiviral medical solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules of caution, using products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in D.C. (DC) is on the Web site of WeWork, which has shared with us and all the staff in DC its COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in D.C. moved completely to remote work in accordance with instructions from San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting a place in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues, working remotely, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider the possibility of splitting them into a course of several days.
Define clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda, and circulate the material in advance.
By default, use video communications to facilitate interaction and communication, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For ease of reference, appoint a focal point — a person who will follow up on questions in the chat room and monitor the list of speakers and the one responsible for notes (or joint notes).
If necessary, contact the Technical Support Service by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement as you purchase snacks.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomics manuals, available in web-based format, to facilitate the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grantees to cancel the massive activities funded by Wikimedia, such as "editathons", until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may lead to the impossibility of carrying out agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for having to delay or change such objectives.
In the coming week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
Global sentiments in the global community are not only frustration over interruptions, but also some relief with mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and more.
In terms of perspective, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide space for the community to monitor exposure and communication.
We remain in touch on matters related to COVID-19.
We'll send an invitation to a special staff meeting in your calendar next Thursday, 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we'll take the opportunity to share more relevant information, answer your questions, and spend time with each other.
We're together in this situation, and we're willing to help anything we can.
You can continue to receive information from such an e-mail, while other important information on COVID-19 is from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If there are questions about travel, events, key workflow, lighting problems or other assistance, contact the CRT.
We stand ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If there are confidentiality problems, contact Brian Judean, director of HR International Global Operations by e-mail.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it recognizes the possible ongoing need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait until the right time.
Today is the time to support each other and to create space for the important work to be done in the weeks to come and perhaps months to come.
For that to happen, we will need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work as efficiently as possible as soon as such a need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katerine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and the rest of the Team Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jamie V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotenzine converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 is countering the activity of the corresponding angiotenzine-transvertive enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotenzine II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as haCE2.
Angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal fermentation located on the surface of endothelic and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-end peptidetic domain M2 and the C-end transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, and its enzyme active domain reaches the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular domain is separated from the trans-membrane domain by another enzyme known as shaddas, and the soluble protein obtained is released into the bloodstream and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most pulmonary pulmonary cells, type II pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary endotal, arterial and venous endotal cells, and cells of the smooth muscles of the arteries of most organs.
The biosynthesis of the ACE2 IRNA is also found in the cortex of the brain, the stratum, the hypothalamus and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE splits the hormone angiotenzine I into a vascularly-reducing angiotenzine II.
ACE2, in turn, decapitates the carboxylene end acid phenylalanzine from angiotenzin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into a vasodilative angiotenzine (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also split a number of other peptids, including [des-Arg9] - bradikinin, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A and greline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.
As a trans-membrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-COV (the SARS virus); and SARS-COV-2 (the COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, linking the S1 protein of SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 to the enzyme ACE2 domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and transposition of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosome inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the pyming of the S protein with a serium protesis of the TMPRSS2 host, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, and has led some to think that lowering ACE2 levels in cells can help in controlling infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend that standard APF and BRA inhibitors should continue.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant 34 per cent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than for patients with general risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is supposed to be an innovation in pulmonary acute pulmonary therapy and appears to improve pulmonary hemodinomic and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory syndrome caused by lipopolishaharids.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the start of the operation is 30 minutes, in addition to the 24-hour exposure period.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with intransigence of classical renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases where circulation angiotensin II has been elevated. RhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile phone software applications designed to assist in the epidemiological investigation of the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20, i.e. the identification of persons (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many annexes have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
Several communication tracking applications have been developed.
This has led to a discussion on confidentiality issues, especially with regard to systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of applications users.
The softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join forces to integrate the Bluetooth support function directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipai, launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they had contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore, it uses an app called TraceTogether.
The application has been developed by local IT companies, has an open source and will be placed under government control. North Macedonia has launched the "StopKorona" application, working on Bluetooth, helping to track contact with potentially infected people and providing operational communication with health authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was expected to register with Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking app was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks, and similar applications were planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and BlueTrace protocol, and Russia intends to use an application with a geosonic function to ensure that patients with COVID-19 diagnosed in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a safety professor, University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false response and potential inefficiency if the application is used by only a small part of the population.
In view of concerns about the proliferation of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that could offer their coronavirus applications to the App Store to include only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also introduced similar restrictions.
The privacy campaign expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance of the population through applications related to the coronavirus; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure established to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat would disappear.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of oversight.
The organizations have announced eight conditions for public projects:
Monitoring should be “legitimate, necessary and proportionate”;
The expansion of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by time limits;
The use of data should be limited to the purpose of controlling the proliferation of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity should be protected and evidence of such security provided;
Digital surveillance should prevent cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the legislative level;
Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters With Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their list of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing their joint plan to address the problem of ongoing monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, web-based location tracking is used instead of applications, which excludes the need to load the application and avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to baseline location data also have significant potential confidentiality problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of systems with confidentiality have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracing information from various sources, including tracking of mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then merged them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government not only used this information to alert citizens to potential contact with infected persons, but also made information on the location available to the public, which was made possible by significant changes in the legislation on the protection of information that had been introduced following the outbreak of MERs in that country.
Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites; countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups were working on confidentiality solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record users approaching other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized traceability with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Context EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identified personal data never leave the device and that all comparisons are made on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, develops SafePaths, a platform to maintain confidentiality in the collection and use of location or path data to track COVID-19 distribution.
The work of the platform is based on the studies published in March 2020 by Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company that develops confidentiality technology, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware to enable users to share confidential data on location and health with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols founded the TCN Global Coalition, which aims to reduce fragmentation and to ensure global compatibility of the tracking and warning applications, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography to preserve confidentiality.
They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Establish tools to enable Governments to establish official applications to track the movement of infected citizens, but with data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple, they plan to solve problems with constant surveillance by first introducing the system through the upgrades of the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Repositioning a drug (also known as reprofiling, redirecting, changing tasks, or therapeutic diversion) is reprofiling an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or medical condition other than the disease originally envisaged in the development.
This is one of the research areas that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of reconvalescent plasma.
Analysis of these sequestration sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective anti-viral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-COV-2 are the papan-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, helica, S protein and ADF-ribophosphasis.
Hussein AA and the co-authors in their doclinical study examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analysed their similarity with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-COV-2, which will be recommended for clinical research.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the “Solidarity” clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that testing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate in accordance with the emergency use permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is allowed under EUA only as an experimental emergency treatment for patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical trial schemes.
CDC stated that “the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection has not yet been established”.
Doctors say they use the drug when there's no other way out.
The Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The Medical School of the University of New York at Langon examines the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Uhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravirus is “singlely effective.”
In the 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug, the result was negative, on average, after 4 days, while in the 45 patients who did not take the drug, the duration of the disease was 11 days.
In Uhan, a study was carried out to monitor 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of whom received favipiravir and the other half received umithenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Authority reminded the public that the results of the drug's effectiveness were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to replenish its stocks and that it would use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post newspaper, Shinzo Abe informed Trump’s administration of the possibility of buying a drug, which could be less effective in neglected cases.
Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who try to get pregnant.
One study on the combination of anti-viral drugs, lapinawire and Ritonawire (Kaletra), concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of the drugs has not been identified”.
The drugs have been designed to inhibit HIV replication by linking them to protease.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a connection that will connect to SARS-COV-2 protesis, and the scientific community is criticizing the reprofiling of drugs that were specifically developed for HIV and AIDS therapy.
WHO has included a combination of lopinavir and rhytonavir in the international Solidarity test.
Remdesivere was created and developed by the Guiled Sciences to treat the Ebola virus and the Marburg viral infections. Glead Sciences later discovered that the Remdesivere has antiviral activity in vitro for a multitude of philo, pneumo, paramix and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with anti-viral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies have shown that the remdesivere may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical trials are under way, including two by Cleveland University Clinics; one by moderately moderate patients; and the other by more severe patients.
Three clinical trials are currently under way for injecting vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, Azitromycin antibiotic tests began in New York State.
The Japan National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclonesonide) Taijin, an inhalation corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for use in the treatment of pre-symptomic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II, a form of angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2, is tested with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who are hospitalized with severe diseases to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with weak COVID-19 symptoms.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 with light symptoms that do not require hospitalization were invited.
Pregnant, breast-feeding women who do not use effective contraceptives cannot participate in the study.
In Italy, several coagulants are being tested.
Low molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has prompted the Italian Drug Administration to publish recommendations for the use of the drug.
On 14 April, a multicentury study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy to study the use of sodium enoxaparian in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-COV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on reprofiling approved anti-viral drugs that were developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially suitable for use in the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has been clinically tested, many attempts to develop it continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the SARS-COV-2 vaccine would be available before 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing phase I security studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-COV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the required speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms for an effective vaccine against COVID-19 were being explored and developed in early 2020.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the phase I security study:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, RNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus vector type 5)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are being used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 additional vaccine candidates have been reported, but there is little public information available (presumably in the planning or development phase).
Phases I to II carry out pre-tests for safety and immunogeneity, usually Randomized, Placebo-controlled and at several sites, while at the same time defining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III of the tests usually involves more participants, including the control group; at this stage the preparations are tested for disease prevention efficiency while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates under active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet undergone human testing (although doclinical research is still in progress).

On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, and the Army Research Institute, Walter Reed, Silver Spring, located in the western part of Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that she had entered into a partnership with Novax Inc.
For the development and production of vaccines.
Partners have also announced plans for the doclinical and clinical trials of phase I by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that it would take at least one-and-a-half or two years to develop the vaccine in an accelerated manner.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec, reported that with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they had created a coronavirus-like particle.
A potential vaccine is under laboratory testing, and human testing is planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac “great amounts of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an INC-based vaccine.

On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), France, announced an investment of $4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine development consortium, with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
The other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford, and University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-implementing COVID-19 RNA-vaccine.
The vaccine candidate drug was developed within 14 days of the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of $275 million to finance 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for a national vaccine bank, which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronavirus.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported on the testing of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, stating that “MNA introduced sub-unitary SARS-COV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong responses to anti-gen-special antibodies [in mice] that appeared two weeks after immunization.”
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Canadian Pharmaceutical School announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be produced in the form of bulk spray.
With bacteriophages, DNA will reproduce within human bacteria and form harmless viral-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-COV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined IBM supercomputer resources with cloud computing resources, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologic effects, also called non-special effects.
This means that they can have other benefits than disease prevention properties.
Another case study in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines that are being developed may prove unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies on the effectiveness of animal-based vaccines, which are characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, point to the need for measures to contain infection with biosafety 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines available to treat SARS that are safe and effective for people.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world, and there is no verified vaccine against MERS either.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the SARS study that had been conducted at that time could be the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-COV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that had passed phase I of human clinical trials, and three other vaccines, all of which were virus vector-based vaccines and were in the process of being developed, two were adenovirus (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA-vectoral (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media spread conspiracy theory, claiming that the COVID-19 virus is not new at all, and that the vaccine against it already exists.
Social media publications quoted some patients who claimed patents for genetic sequences of other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) which is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and respiratory problems.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between the first symptoms and the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also range from two to fourteen days.
The majority of cases are mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows to viral pneumonia and polyorganic insufficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people died of the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is spread mainly through close contact between people, often through microscopic drops released into the air by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these drops are formed by exhalation, they usually pose a threat by entering the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air at long distances.
People are also infected with contaminated surfaces and then with their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after the symptoms appear, although it may be possible both before the symptoms appear and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymeraceous chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PRC) on a sample taken as a swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients with suspicion of illness, as well as to those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks differ: some agencies recommend that they not be used at all, some recommend their use and others require it.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local prevalence was reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breath.
Emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, constant pain or a feeling of depression in the chest, confusion of consciousness, difficulty in awakening, facial or lip condition; if the symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought without delay.
The symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, sniffing, or throat pain, may be more severe.
Also, in different percentages there are gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Some cases reported in China were initially merely a feeling of chest depression and heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress into pneumonia, polyorganic insufficiency, and eventually death.
It's called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people start showing symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, and not all of them are reported to show symptoms.
The role of such non-symptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of people infected with non-symptomic disease is currently unknown and is only being studied, while the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations of the virus were symptomless.
The National Health Commission of China began to include non-symptomous cases in its daily report on 1 April; of the 166 cases reported on that date, 130 (78%) were rejected without symptoms at the time of testing.
Both wet and saliva can have a greater concentration of the virus.
In a loud speech, more drops are released into the air than in a normal volume speech.
A study conducted in Singapore found that the drops can spread up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) with open cough.
The virus is generally not airborne, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transfer of particles of the virus by bioaerosol is still possible, and the testing of the air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (CLR), can lead to the dispersal of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through fecals, but the risk is considered to be low; the virus is the most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms occur, but the risk is small.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that it is not clear how easily the virus is spread, yet it is known that one patient usually infects two to three other people, and the virus can survive on the surface from hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could live on the cardboard surface for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% of the copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These figures, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, when properly used, have a rather useful effect in controlling infection: soap destroys the fat layer of the virus, deactivating it, and can also remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorgexide gluconate (surgical disinfectant) are less effective against the virus, and in a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
For five out of six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and for the sixth patient, the highest level of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.
The severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome that was first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All signs of the new SARS-COV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens up its protective casing.
The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19 because the virus penetrates host cells through angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar lung cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell with the characteristic surface glycoprotein, the "spin" (peplomer).
12 per cent of the infected people admitted to the hospital in Ouhan have been diagnosed with severe damage to myocardial, which is more common in a severe form of disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the system inflammatory response and immune system disturbances observed during the progression of the disease, but acute damage to myocardium may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in large quantities in the heart because they participate in the work of this body.
The high frequency of thrombosis (31 per cent) and venous thromboembolia (25 per cent) was observed in patients in the CIT with COVID-19, and may indicate bad predictions. The autopia of patients killed by COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar injuries (DAD) and lymphocytho inflammatory infiltrations in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropic effect on ACE2-expressing epithelial paths, patients with heavy flow COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it has been found that GM-XF pathogen T cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes emitting IL-6 and heavy lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocitar infiltrations were also found at the autopsy.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
The real-time polymeric chain reaction (RT-CPR) is a standard test method.
The test shall normally be carried out on respiratory samples obtained with a swab from the nose, but a swab sample from the nose or wet may also be used.
The results are usually available for a period of between a few hours and two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate the strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibodies tests that could detect infection at the present time, as well as possible contamination in the past, were under development but are not yet widely available.
Chinese experience with the results of these tests has shown that they are only 60 to 70 per cent accurate.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, allowing it to be used at the end of this month.
Bilateral multi-pronged sub-propellural compaction tricks of the type of “matter glass” with peripheral, asymmetrical and a posterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Sub-plural dominance, the symptom of a rocky bridge (adjusted chunking of a variable alveolar-filled partition) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic injuries and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
Main results of an autopsy pathological study:
Macroscopy: pleurite, pericarditis, sealing and lung swelling
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light form of pneumonia: lung swelling, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocitar infiltration, and multi-nuclear giant cells
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudat.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory stress syndrome (RDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Acute pneumonia: organization of exsudes in alveolary beds and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravenous folding (DVC Syndrome); leukaeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowds, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the ulna.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a quality hand hygiene procedure be carried out.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, inter alia, to limit transmission of infections by persons with an unsymptomed flow of disease; social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have resulted in the closure of schools and businesses, the restriction of citizens ' movement and the abolition of large public activities.
Distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no proven-efficiency drugs against COVID-19. Since the development of the vaccine is not expected to be completed before 2021, most of the measures against the proliferation of COVID-19 are to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the “to-the-plateau” epidemic.
CDC also recommends that hands with soap and water should be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or severe hand pollution, as well as before food and after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of alcohol disinfectant (alcohol content at least 60 per cent) for hand processing, but only where soap and water are not available, and WHO provides two prescriptions for local production to regions where such disinfectant is not sold.
These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial disputes in alcohol and is not a suitable tool for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
Patients are shown support therapy, which may include infuse therapy, oxygen support, and other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they are infected with the virus wear a common medical mask.
Extracorporal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
In order to strengthen immunity, personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diet are recommended.
Supportive treatments can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease, and WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care doctors and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic advice of various institutions in a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some doctors recommend that paracetamol (acetaminophen) be opted for the treatment of symptoms as first-line drugs in relation to ibuprofen.
Precautionary measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health-care facilities, when performing procedures in which air-capable emissions, such as intubation or hand-drying, may occur.
The CDC recommends that health workers who care for people with COVID-19 should be placed in an air capsule (AIIR), an additional measure, in addition to the standard contact and air precautions, and the CDC has published recommendations on the use of personal protection devices (PISs) during a pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves; it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
The N95 repairers have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the Emergency Application Permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but, when used not according to instructions, the protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If the medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective face screens or, in the event of emergency, the making of masks independently in the home.
In most cases, the forms of current COVID-19 are not heavy enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory insufficiency associated with COVID-19 is currently under active study, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by using an oxygen nozzle with intense airflow or a two-tier positive pressure in the respiratory paths.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods are as effective for patients in critical condition as SVL.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, if available, because this method significantly restricts the distribution of particles in the air compared to the high-velocity nasal tubules; the risk of severe disease for older persons (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
Many developed countries lack hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the dramatic increase in the incidence of severe COVID-19 infections that require hospitalization.
One study in China revealed that 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 eventually enter the ICU.
The task of providing artificial ventilation of the lungs is complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), developed with COVID-19, and oxygenation is increasingly problematic.
EVLs with inhalation pressure and PCRs are necessary to deliver maximum oxygen to the lungs and to ensure that they are minimized by ventilation, which can result in pneumothorax development.
In earlier fan models, high PVCs may not be available.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and several anti-viral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
The most promising is the Remdesire.
The development of new medicines may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested for patients with severe diseases.
Recommended by WHO, volunteers are involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted temporary permission to use reconvalescent plasma as a pilot treatment in cases where life is at serious or immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to clinical research to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat the outbreak.
Users must enter their name and identification number for entry.
The application may detect “near contact” with observation data and, therefore, determine the potential risk of contamination.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is discovered, the application not only recommends self-insulation but also sends a notification to local health authorities; large-scale data analysis from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence; such tools are used to track infected people and people they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to track the mobile phone data of people allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Measures had been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who could contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, he provided federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to detect violators of quarantine.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said that cellular network operators reported that “40% of people still move around the territory.”
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
The Estonian President, Kersty Kalulaid, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People can experience stress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor: “Enhanced social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming the mental health and well-being of people.”
Diseases can occur in light form with slight or missing symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common cold.
Patients with mild illness generally recover within two weeks, while the treatment of patients with severe or critical forms may take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of having a heavy form of COVID-19 based on data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although such data are not available for COVID-19. Some people may be exposed to lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In the case of persons with the most severe current of the disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorganic failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, anomaly, and heart, kidney, and liver problems.
Anomalies of thromboforming, especially the increase in protrombin time, were described in 6 per cent of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while 4 per cent of the group experienced kidney impairment.
About 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early studies, the average time between the initial symptoms and the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study carried out by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 per cent and for women 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exsudates in both lungs.
There were viral cytopathic changes in the pneumocytes.
The appearance of the lung was similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome.
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths registered by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were caused by an increase in the level of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary according to state due to such regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
Inadequate calculation of cases in light form may lead to an overestimation of mortality.
Nevertheless, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is undervalued.
In the case of smokers, the severe symptoms of COVID-19 were generally 1.4 times more frequent, with patients about 2.4 times more in need of intensive care or dying than non-smokers, and concerns were expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of a clinic in Hong Kong found that some patients recovering from the disease had reduced their lungs by between 20 and 30 per cent, and their scans revealed injuries.
After recovery, it can also lead to after-intensive care.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients recovering from the virus were immune to the virus.
According to the current of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but there were also reported cases where the coronavirus test was still positive after recovery from COVID-19.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an aggravated prolonged period of disease rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, animal and infectious.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the infection was almost entirely attributable to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, describes 1 December 2019 as the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, the date was 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to measure mortality.
All figures vary according to region and time, and are also affected by the level of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time of the outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and general health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency codes to ICD-10: U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinical or epidemiological-diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-COV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191).
This figure varies from region to region; some other methods include the determination of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died as a result of the disease, as well as the determination of the transmission mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of a certain segment of the population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced by all patients who have been infected, the presence of such antibodies suggests how many people have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castillon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 persons (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the celebration of carnival to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population can have antibodies based on blood supply.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates vary between men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The group most at risk is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women has narrowed only since the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of female smoking, associated with male diseases (e.g. hypertension in men at younger ages than women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were men, and 72 per cent of deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not maintained gender statistics for COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and EPRI have different gender statistics.
The majority of health-care workers, especially nurses, are women and therefore have a better chance of becoming infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom Gebreus, explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease” and the 19th year when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of humans, as required by international recommendations for naming to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
In public communications, WHO uses the terms “COVID-19” and “COVID-19 virus”.
Both the disease and the virus themselves are commonly referred to as the “Kronavirus.”
During the initial outbreak in Ouhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the "Kronavirus" and the "Khana Coronavirus".
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “spicular respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names "COVID-19" and "SARS-COV-2" were published.
Because of the limitations on the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials, such as nose swabs, as well as details of SVL machines.
In one such case, the Italian clinic was in urgent need of a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame, and one of the local facilities was reprofiled and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake information about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects became available at a high rate on the Internet.
Humans may be able to infect other animals with the virus.
Research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
So far, there is no approved vaccine against the virus or drugs for its treatment.
Various international studies on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 are currently being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial programme, the aim of which is to assess the treatment effect of the four existing compounds considered to be most effective to date.
There is no completed vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 penetrate human cells with the ACE2 receptor, so research uses the results of previous research on SARS-COV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead form, is intended to trigger a rapid immune response from the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a sub-unit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that increases the immune system's sensitivity to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, such studies aim at destroying the S-shaped protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA-vaccines, new vaccine methodology).
Experimental vaccines developed in any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, Seattle began the first clinical test of the vaccine on four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code, copied from the virus that causes the disease, and the antiteleosaviable increase has been identified as a potential problem in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted.
The drugs approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven tests, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The reprofiling of anti-viral drugs is a major part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III studies had been carried out in several countries.
As of April 2020, the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for COVID-19 was reviewed dynamically. Several other existing anti-viral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered for the same purpose, including remdesivere, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/retonavir, combined with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of remdesvira are available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients who received the Remdesivere as an exception.
Phase III of the clinical trials is already under way in the US, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used for malaria treatment was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling the dose is very dangerous and can lead to fatality.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a permit for the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for detailed study in vivo by demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-COV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that in order to penetrate SARS-COV-2 by interacting with the ACE2 receptor, a transmembrane protein serine 2 (TMPRSS2).
Research on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study; Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemy may occur as a complication at late stages of the heavy form COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinemy properties, and a small study by the National Health Commission of China has included tocilismab in the recommendation for the treatment of coronavirus.
This drug has reached stage 2 of a non-randomised test conducted at the national level in Italy, after positive results have been obtained from patients with severe disease.
Combined with a blood serum test on ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counter factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved antagonist interlakin-6 receptor based on retrospective case studies to treat the release syndrome of steroid refractory cytokine caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective remedy for Cytokin release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 to people in need is now seen as a non-vaccinary method of passive immunization.
The strategy was tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but the results were not convincing.
Neutralization of the virus is the expected effect that passive antibodies therapy can provide protection against SARS-COV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as anti-body-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis, may be used.
Other forms of passive antibodies therapy, such as those made with monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of a liquid portion of the blood of healed patients and contains antibodies against the virus, can be increased.
