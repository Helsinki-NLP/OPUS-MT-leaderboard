Republican Strategy to Resist Obama’s Re-Elect
Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat falsification in elections.
However, at the Brennan Center, the latter is considered a myth, arguing that falsifications in the United States are rarer than deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 electoral falsifications in the United States in ten years.
One thing can be said with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions have partially discredited the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have enacted laws since 2009 that complicate the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon gained a new dimension after the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were passed in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require the voter to present a photographic identity card and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish voter registration on the date of expression and remove the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to produce a photo identity card.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated legislation requiring voters to produce photographic identity cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Québec, American citizens do not have the same universal identity card as a health insurance card.
Indeed, 11 per cent of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have an identity card with a photograph issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such a document.
However, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over the age of 65 and 20 per cent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo identification.
But that's not all.
Students who are considered to vote for Democrat candidates are not allowed in several states to use photo identification cards issued by their educational institution.
However, the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use the licenses issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required proof of American citizenship for voting.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are US citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latin Americans.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators initiated legislation in 2011 to abolish voter registration on voting day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those wishing to register.
That restriction did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to put about 10 million citizens on the list.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17 per cent drop in the voter registration rate in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although the latter represented only 13 per cent of the total number of voters in the state.
The same was true of Latin Americans.
They represented only 11 per cent of the electorate and accounted for 24 per cent of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike white voters, who formed 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of those who voted in advance.
Of course, Democrat legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws have been enacted by the Democratic Governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Prosecutor-General.
This has allowed for a partial limitation of the negative effects.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring photo identification.
Nevertheless, the new rules that have come into effect will certainly impede the exercise of the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Democratic critics condemn the biased laws that have been adopted, with a clear focus on influencing the 2012 elections in key states.
The report of the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the Bench to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions have partially discredited the system of American democracy.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Test or not?
In fact, the PSA test gives sometimes erroneous results, false and sometimes false positive, leading to useless medical intervention.
Men who are so reluctant to undergo dispensation have much more to question.
Do you want to go through the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the United States have found many cases of infection among groups of researchers, so it is difficult to interpret the data and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, has found different mortality rates for patients who have been screened and those who have not.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastasis is 30-40% higher for those who have not been screened.
So I'd recommend that the test begin from the age of 50, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and vintage.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering him options without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a risk to life in the long term, and by choosing, in these cases, to actively monitor the disease.
To date, many men diagnosed with cancer will not receive treatment because their cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we'll start treatment.
Increasingly, we are setting out precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So, I would recommend that we do the test after all.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not the test is required.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Moviember has developed a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, healthy lifestyles remain the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were to eat well and move well enough, 30 percent of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one else had smoked, that figure would have increased to at least 50%," stressed André Bole, Spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is related to 85% of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to human health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says Spokesman André Bolet.
An encouraging fact is that 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," they add to the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
It increases the risk of colon cancer in too many quantities.
Sausage should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salt can lead to carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to cancer," explains the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been researching the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer.
But the results of these studies are not clear at the moment.
According to SCC, the results of vitamin E studies are contradictory.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
There is also a lack of clarity in the evaluation of the impact on the development of vitamin D cancer.
However, he stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family history with the doctor.
"Releasing doesn't lead to cancer."
Higgs Boson in Details
In the past summer, the report that scientists may have been able to locate Higgs' boson has caused real anxiety - and not without cause.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
Moreover, it is the last particle that was predicted to exist in the Standard Model -- our best, or at least the least imperfect, description of the nature and behavior of matter -- but that was not previously discovered in an experienced way.
But physicists aren't sure it's the Higgs Boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it's a lot like the Higgs Boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, the new data presented this week at a major physical convention in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full certainty.
Let's just say this is Higgs' boson, because the chances of making mistakes seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, a very inevitable law that says that two things can't end up in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to get around this rule, don't even try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one such law: the principle of excluding Paulie, which suggests that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same point in time, if they are in the same “quantum state” - the “state” is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called ferrions, who are wisely subject to the principle of Paulie.
The other is the fuss of the bosons, the abominable gang of anarchists, who have no respect for anything - at least this principle, which means that they can be quietly in the same place at the same time.
According to the website (such as the most unusual) Partile Adventure of Berkeley Labs, these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesomons we're not going to talk about, and the "particles of power" through which the basic forces of nature are spread, and which in some ways include the Higgs Boson.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all as exotic as might be thought.
In fact, if you can read this chronics, it's because of one incredibly trivial boson: photon, or "part of light," which is the "courier" of electromagnetic power.
Indeed, when one particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes its direction, it “breaks” the electromagnetic field in this particular location, roughly like a stone thrown into the pond.
This “violation” produces an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon, and therefore one of the carriers.
More stable field
The same thing happens with Higgs' boson, with the only difference that, in order for that boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be broken.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to energize it, you have to achieve very, very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That's why there's a huge particle accelerator, like the one that's operating in CERN, the Great Adronic Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 kilometers!, to achieve such huge energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful in explaining the relationship between Higgs' boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on the fridge.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (as photon, by the way) do not.
So, what "can bring" all this research, asks Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to find a discrepancy between observations and projections of CM.
And some of them are passionate about finding this difference, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and shut some of the Model holes.
The latter, I must say, still has significant shortcomings, without suggesting any explanation for gravity or for dark matter that forms about 80 percent of the universe.
But so far, the CERN has not found such differences.
Consequences
It is more difficult to predict from these studies for the daily life of the average human being, but it would be a mistake to assume that they are not.
Look, early in the 1960s, pioneers in laser research at Bella's labs couldn't even imagine what kind of revolution their work would trigger.
They anticipated their applications in science, but nothing more.
Indeed, already a deceased physicist, Willard Boyle, who worked at Bella Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previously impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was originally viewed as more of a laboratory gadget.
Imagine...
And besides, an app can be found for a toolbox accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical research in 1969.
This sensor, although not his original purpose, now serves as an eye for all digital cameras in the world and has earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will make a difference in our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can happen.
Palliative care is the best way to die...
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
Debates are about to resume, and a bill is being drafted.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
Long tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterezi.
Prostate cancer that destroyed him from the inside gave him a two-year extension.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor Gadbua's palliative care home in Beloy, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, you can't prepare for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom on your own or even eating on your own.
As he sits at a table where he has a delicious meal, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He wakes up, even gets to smile, speak to strangers who work around him, bring him medication, take him to the bathtub.
Courage before a normal death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease.
"For the rest of our lives, we've been taught that a man should pee standing up," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbua's shelter.
Regression to the condition of the child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"Everything depends on a person's ability to deal with the decline," he claims.
Since many palliative caretakers believe that important events occur in the midst of this decline.
Patients who go to Victor Gadbua's palliative shelter are all cancer patients.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses is no longer providing care called “medical care”.
Mrs. A., 89 years old, is the most afraid of dying "in a state of suffocation."
But the disease made it possible for me to recognize my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before I let her put a mask that makes her breathing easier.
She still awaits her son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
At the Victor Gadbua shelter, a group of volunteers provide body care and nutrition assistance.
That's palliative care that stays when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
Québec has one place in palliative care for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That's not enough, considering we're all gonna die sooner or later.
This is where life continues under the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at the shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or emotional.
We'll agree to give the dying man mouth stripes of brandy or pepsi, whatever he asks.
Diabetes are no longer forced to control sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died last night.
His son drank that beer in the dead man's legs this morning.
"We're helping loved ones as well as patients," says Natalie Savar, director of nursing.
Victor Gadbua's shelter doesn't look like the last day.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the courtyard, resting on his pillows during a toast to his honor, a 36-year-old man, surrounded by parents, his wife and two young children, die tragically, and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, between three and five beds, always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christian Martel, concerned.
53 per cent of patients admitted to the Victor Gadbua shelter come from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stage of their lives, whether at home, hospital or shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor Gadbua shelter and the Grand Montreal House Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this large gap in Québec’s health system that makes many palliative care physicians fear a law legitimizing euthanasia and suicidal assistance.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the laymen in the field of palliative care has been circulating, indicating their opposition to such an initiative, by Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Québec's health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative care of high quality before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the E.R., in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.
I'm afraid patients only want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have tried to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
Ellen Richard's hope of survival was already minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was discontinuing treatment, she said that she regretted that I was ending the struggle, she said.
She told me that my days were numbered!
There's no all-powerful care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team has eased their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not entirely powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Big Montreal House Society, patients are not susceptible to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to a palliative session where the patient sleeps until his death, either occasionally or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't know about this suffering anymore.
Increasingly, patients who are unable to relieve the pain will be able to access a palliative session.
Patients with pain always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want to get euthanasia," it means "I want to get better."
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute of Health Studies of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political party fund-raisers and Italian mafia professionals tell day after day what they know about the huge “system” surrounding the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
The industry, which was very expensive to the taxpayers of Québec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how this system disintegrates after all the means have been put into action, "is joked by Jacques Duceno, the deputy and the former chief of the Montreal Police."
It was through him that a scandal broke out in 2011 as a side effect of the investigation of official offences related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the then liberal Prime Minister, Jean Share, was reluctant to accept.
The Duceno Report has established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“Since the investigation began in 2010, he stresses that the Department of Transport alone would have kept a billion dollars on contracts” if some had restrained their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonno Commission “has already removed the two mayors”, he adds, hoping that it will be able to “discover the schemes behind the individual”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The 2011 Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which included a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts, joined the case.
In addition, members of the special unit Molot, who, after 2009, forced Montreal's “compartment cartel”, to stop overstatement of contracts.
A series of searches had been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcott, the mayor of a small town, had been charged with fraud and corruption.
The next is Gille Wyangcourt, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of receiving multiple bribes when placing government orders.
In addition, a number of route engineers from Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurto and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The last one blew up a real bomb, reporting an investigation into the “system” of obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3 per cent of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to a Mafia broker who, in turn, transferred the money of Mayor Gerald Tramble's "United Montreal" party.
In the 2000s, Zambito soaked money to the right and left, and he transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to the various parties in the province, mostly the liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Excessed value contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system worked unrelentingly.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts that he overstretched.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted to having received 30-40 per cent of the bills on their paws with false additions.
Then a mayor's party organizer, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately ignoring the existence of a parallel budget that filled party cash with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned early in November, putting Montreal in deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of Rivier de Prairie County, in the east of the island, has resisted, since 2010, the sale of a five-million-dollar municipal plot and resold for... 1.6 million developers in the middle of a building boom.
70% of the dirty money in campaign campaigns
She says that in an investigation that will eventually be initiated, she will “tread a thread to understand the functioning of the ant-infested system to stop gangrene and identify the perpetrators”.
This process is characterized as a “sick but positive” process.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we clean the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duceno notes, for his part, that “workers stole hundreds of millions of dollars”, but he is particularly concerned about the role of “electoral officials who knew about this scheme” but who were not involved in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in funding the electoral campaign in Quebec is 70%, he jokes, "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Québec government proposes to limit to $100 the donations to the parties, but he says it won't change the situation: "Until we strictly limit the electoral costs, politics will have dirty money."
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of State contracts and party financing: “We cannot go down; by taking a bold look at things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duceno calls upon those who laugh to look into their own courtyard...
"SVU is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've reached an extraordinary scale at the SVU.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual awareness, but it can also be explained by the new dimension of the SVU.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical staff have also made a great deal of contributions.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
It's all happening very quickly in football.
But I'm not falling apart.
From the very beginning, I've always been moving forward at the preliminary training centre of the NIF in Clairefontaine until my arrival in St. Etienne.
So you're benefiting from the competition established by Carlo Anchelotti...
It's not new to play very high-level games to fill this summer.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to a player like me wanting to be at the top of the table and to be as good as possible.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotti supports my positioning.
He's being helped by deputies like Claude Maciquelle, who played in the same position as I did.
Ancelotti is the master of the position?
Of course.
Ancelotti is respectful to all technical staff.
He is one of Europe’s best coaches in the First League today.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with the great players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I walked away from a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the SWS season?
In the First League, Lyon took our leader's seat.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have been highly qualified in the eighth finale.
What's the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
From now on, it could be.
We can say our word face-to-face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our band, before Porto, to be able to accept the match back in one of the eight finals.
Will the CSW be able to become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that.
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate positions over the long term.
That's not true today.
Financially, SWD has the means to make this project real.
Not taking the title to the First League, like last season, would be a big setback?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want this championship.
Last season, we were close to it.
In May, it was a disappointment, because we had everything to get to the finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Typically, 79 points are for championship.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that strong teams like Marcel, Lyon and Bordeaux have joined the battle for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expect too much from SVU?
It's okay to expect a lot of money from us, given how much money we've invested and how many players we've got.
We're all ready for that.
On the other hand, when we're at home winning 4-0 against Trua and we're still found to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people want from us first.
We can never win every weekend with a 4-0 bill.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to implement a game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven at the League of Champions that we can respond to today's challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who for two seasons has not been able to make it to the eighth finale, even though they have spent a lot of money too!
Given the amount invested, we've represented you 15 points ahead by the winter break.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and the French championship.
Leon and Marcel, who weren't up for the last season, were "energized" by this new SVU.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
SVP seems to be entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovich's feats.
So what if they say there's some sort of "Golden Dependence."
This only means that Ibrahimovich is very successful and has scored a lot of heads.
He came here to do that and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-wide star.
In the band, we respect him as a man and a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
It also encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro2012 with the French team?
What a disappointment.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma has prevented me from wasting some game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out more.
Today, I'm able to play good qualifiers.
That's what I've been hoping for since I got baptized at the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and must now be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham, headed by the Blues?
They're good for him.
He's got good positions in the selection team for the World Cup.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players, and he inspires us to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us as the Euro.
I hope Didier Desham brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved tie (1-1) ripped out on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us confidence in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, my career had never had a match like this.
To pay and sell without the help of the banks - with Bitcoin
Total contrast to the current exchange of money based on centrobanks numbered transactions between receiving parties with commission fees for processing them.
Moreover, as these technologies often occur, a political vision is evident: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, is causing financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is simultaneously a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros ...) and a protected BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows for the exchange of files between members of the same level.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a payment.
At a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, Bitcoin fell to $2 five months later before returning to about $10 today (the courses are listed on Bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the world's exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in the system in its October Virtual Currency Report.
He describes Bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to ordinary currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, as “credits” used to promote in a video game that is earned in the game or that can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all network nodes are both account holders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user select another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction do exist in a public account that has been sent all over the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in the book.
It goes through a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, has the privilege of adding this new line.
This is the hash phase of the file, i.e. converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hash" all together.
The aim is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
Transaction is thus indissolubly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If the user wanted to pay the same money twice in less than ten minutes for the purpose of deceit, only one of the two transactions would have been confirmed by the network – and the other would have been unsubstantiated because they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, the award is regularly divided in half, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, leaving a reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with increased computing capacity.
The life of the network has already survived ups and downs.
The Bitcoin sites were attacked and the Bitcoins were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect used does not affect the protocol itself," says Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a company that pays with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of laundering money through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this weakness.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as WordPress blogs, are allowed to do so.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weitzman Institute in Israel analyzed the account book and found that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
“Gigant sales” were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," lamented by Yon Holmquist, who works at Coinabul, who converts Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of the currency benefit, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or a non-contact payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is cheaper.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It's just enough to give you an address that you can "photograph and recognize" with your phone, and Pierre Nuaza clarifies that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to re-examine hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin is established, it will take some time, but 2013 may be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB's report suggests, by the way, a review of the various risks that are considered to be heightened today if the system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapiza and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future without hope of us alone.
We have suffered mainly from Afghan peasants, whom we saw as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 dead soldiers, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case in the USSR.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are being tolerated, sometimes assisted by local rebels, but will no longer be as soon as the West acts more delicately.
The departure of the French forces from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credit, was in order.
Truck convoys and armoured vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between different factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a form of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the gloomyness of these peasants, in which they have been surpassed by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved today.
The former Mujahids, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into merchants who took over State land to resell them to returnees who had returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge United States subcontracts.
They were discredited; most of them, by the way, didn't even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, want a government that's not a thief.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have succeeded in American generosity: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; there are now 5 million people in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
State schools in cities are filled with boys and girls alike.
These young people must be provided with jobs, who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and who watch everywhere.
There's an army right now.
Will the authorities who will command her be considered legitimate?
The anti-Soviet commanders are already taking steps to restore provincial wives who are not subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to a certain extent, as the Western countries did, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, starting in the 1950s, and even before, depended on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dams are functioning, and no irrigation system has been repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruit.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by the war of thirty years, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan possesses enormous mineral wealth.
This only increased the feeling that the Western countries were there to take possession of them.
Without the power to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Ainak Copper Field, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers in the province.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, re-establish normal relations one day.
The withdrawal of the French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provided for the preservation of traditional assistance: girls ' faces, boys, French language department at the University, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and support for an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “conquer hearts and minds” and fulfil the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the “military-civilian” service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French social organization, has contributed to numerous community work and activities aimed at restoring agriculture to dozens of mountain villages.
These efforts, with the intensive involvement of the local labour force, have helped to contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in arable land.
What will we leave to remember by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in Kapisa province.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign factions, as the farmers said to me, they need a little non-military support that is well controlled and directly addressed.
Difficult childbirth of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever, on the question of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, it has decided to play a va-bank.
After surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
Soon, for two years now, Egypt has relied on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratical delusions" by continuing to "break the word" and "break the right".
In the camp, his followers are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article after article.
For the President, it is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages throughout the country.
Muhammad Morsi seems confident that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in an interview to American weekly Time.
Especially since the call for accelerated voting is like an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: “Or you vote for my text, or I leave myself with extraordinary powers”, which is supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
For the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 persons, spares, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, have been amazed by the fact that one of the few differences of the day arose around... the time for prayer, because some members of the committee felt that the timing of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text on which the vote was still held yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, article 2 ultimately remained identical to the article in the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the sharia principles are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was a basic requirement, had hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, thus allowing for their stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a demonstration of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Physics," answer the liberals, who see it only as PR.
Because, in their view, Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of the conformity of sharia law.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pomier, this is alarming because “the people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals are also encouraged by the fact that the next president of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
"There is no specific religious interference at this time.
With this constitution, we remain under civil law.
The majority of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulemes, but university students, some were studying in the French system” – comforts Alexis Bloé, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “there may be ambiguities around article 220, since the terms used in it are taken from religious language.
This applies in particular to “fikhs” [Islamic jurisprudence, ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent civilian judges are to rule on this.”
In addition to its religious dimension, the text adopted yesterday was criticized because it gave wide powers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly reduced compared to those of the old regime.
Another controversial point: the authority of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will be reviewed by the National Defence Council rather than the Parliament.
Nor would the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be detrimental to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy had been retained and insults were now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, and especially for freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles speaks more about the protection of a woman, as Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch, points out.
According to her, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that didn't appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was scheduled to perform on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State, in turn, will be on the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Pup of Earth and the sea from the skies.
The Promised Land combines the greatness of Bible truths, the modern comfort, and the originality of nature.
AIF has identified five of the most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Let's bow to holy places.
It is good to visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
Everyone who enters this "buyer" is believed to have the grace of God.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus ’ miracles: to turn water into wine at the wedding, to walk on the water, to calm the storm, and to fill the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before his disciples and after his resurrection.
But the most holy things in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here pass through the Path of Smurf or the Path of the God of Jesus (Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antony-Pretorium, where there was judgment, and leads to the temple of the Lord at Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of Salvation, and the place of the burial of Jesus.
Here, too, is the symbolic Christian Earth’s Pupe, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which a cross was made for Jesus ’ crucifixion.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jews, the Wall of Cry, left behind from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave notes here with desires that follow.
Make a vertical journey
The ruins of the fortress of Massada remained from the secret refuge of the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on high rocks in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above the sea level.
Only climbers are able to reach them.
The rest of this historic peak is transported by a lift on the ropes.
And in the north of the country, there is a famous mountain ski resort in Hermon, where a huge influx of tourists takes place during the winter months.
He's got a shuttle bus at the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski tracks is 45 km.
Ancient tradition suggests that pagan gods lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don't go to everyone for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Israeli Museum, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth a visit to the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
His exhibits include the paintings of impressionists and expressionists Mone, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Seasley, Matisse, Modilani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al-Basha Museum, which is a series of ancient Turkish baths with suits of visitors and banners of the time.
In Cesarea, you should go to the unique private museum of Rally, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance is free and the donations are categorically rejected.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad-Wash in Tel Aviv, describes one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the Children's Memorial, was built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it and you end up in absolute darkness.
The stars are blinking.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Get well.
The three main Israeli resort zones are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has pools, water parks, dolphins, and oceaniums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is bathed even in the winter months, since the temperature of the water does not fall below 21 degrees of heat and the air is warmed up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is warmer and bathing all year long.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world at the lowest point of the planet, 417 metres below the ocean level.
The azure water in it is dissolute, easy to keep floating even if they can't swim at all.
The landscapes are unreally beautiful.
They come here to receive treatments using salt water — rapa, and medicinal mud — and to treat the health of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and sugar to fix the shaken nerves.
Touching the Secrets of the Ancient
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Yaffa on the shore of the Mediterranean.
Through it was the famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, this is where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful woman Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of wandering around the narrow streets named after the Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your sign, Fortune will be favorable.
In Jaffa, you can find newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even from other countries in a photo shoot.
And in Cesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander around the Roman theater, "remove" the fortress of the crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judah and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
A carefully renovated theatre is now being used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A Visitor for a Note
When going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: about 30 percent of the population in the country speaks Russian.
It is better to borrow money for a trip in dollars rather than in euros, which are easy to trade for shekels (now US$ 1 - NIS 3.8).
Urban transport is mostly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa is the country's only subway line, consisting of six stations, linking Lower City to Upper City.
Basically, it's an underground funicler.
Travel in all modes of urban transport is worth six shekels, for which you can travel with transplants within 1.5 hours.
In Israel, it is Jewish tradition to observe the Sabbath Sabbath.
From Friday evening until sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport are shut down.
And on Sunday morning, the week of work begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only cosher food that excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that combine milk with meat.
It offers a large variety of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta hummus, a variety of sauces, hammered nut balloons — phalal, fruit, and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Well, there's a lot of fed cats that go on their own.
Even on the rooftops of parked cars, they can be seen sleeping in the evening.
Murtleys like crowded places and don't give up on treats.
The rental of the vehicle, depending on the stamp, will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And a bike will cost 15 bays a day.
The average price of tickets to museums is 30 shekels.
Number Language
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
The most traveling and vacations were the citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, an increase of 51 per cent over the 2010 figure, prior to the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Great and Mighty" to Moscow will lead migrants to save money in their language.
As long as deputies and human rights defenders are arguing about giving the law on compulsory language testing, there are already fraudsters in the country selling “leaf” certificates.
Every year, 13 million gastrobytes arrive in Moscow, Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to support families in their homeland.
As of 1 December, the law requiring every migrant worker to take the Russian language proficiency examination had entered into force.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the areas of services, housing and utilities, welfare and retail.
In time, however, the FMS promises, the tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
But not only language, but Russian history and the foundations of legislation will have to be handed over.
Language skills will have to be confirmed for both receipt and extension of work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the national language.
Nor do people who have completed their diplomas and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 fall within the scope of the law.
Benefits, doomsdays and protection of rights
The network of examination points will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the MGU, the SPBGU and other Russian universities.
Migrants would be able to pass tests in all cities; already more than 160 such centres had been opened in Russia.
Both the State Duma and the FMS supported the initiative to introduce testing.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, had many times asked the press, "What will it really do?"
What will change the requirement of language skills for both Russians and visitors themselves?
First of all, the migration service responds, which will reduce the number of people suffering from “labour slavery”.
Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explaining the head of the Russian FMS office in Tajikistan, Victor Seblev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90 per cent.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, education that does not know the language and does not have a medical certificate.
Without understanding the language, I'm sure Seblev, a future migrant is doomed to encounter unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will throw him into a terrible, narrow barracks, where he and dozens of his kind will be bored for months without food and documents, working 12-14 hours a day.
We're getting a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“They are promised one thing in their home country, and upon arrival they are deceived, passports are taken, and the promised salary is not paid”, confirmed the head of the General Directorate of Labour Migration of MS Tolib Sharif.
Don't swear, you scooter!
However, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian republics are going to work in Russia, it is recognized that not only do they not know the language of the country to which they aspire, but it is difficult to write on their own.
Of course, it is not their fault but their trouble: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even meaningful primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to do with feeding their children, not to mention proper clothing, clothing, and dressing for school.
Growing up to adolescence, these guys go to work at the earliest opportunity.
It is hard, if they are ill in knowledge of the language, to admit it.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that human rights defenders note an important point with regard to the law on language.
Testing will only be carried out for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the gastrobyters still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or no outsider."
Many of the visitors claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and still the same language difficulties.
Besides, legalization is worth 12 to 16,000 rubles.
But a fake registration can be made quickly and for only 1,500.
The Russian police know that we've got mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"One hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," he shared with the journalists a citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushadamov.
"Fuck it, don't be stingy, buy art."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it became apparent that not only migrant registration documents were false.
Several “lip” certificates for language tests have already been withdrawn by FMS staff.
Fake papers are printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get it for nothing: each of the migrants who hoped to make the test easier for themselves paid 7,000 roubles for the document.
This is more than twice as expensive as a formal test procedure: it will cost a migrant worker 3,000.
The challenge for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that crusts cannot simply be bought, and both authorities and human rights defenders come together.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise the first-time testers a time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered jobs in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not trade in the illegal arms market
The proportion of offences involving legal weapons is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law on civilian weapons owners.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: pressing shots at weddings when no casualties occurred, and the massacre by Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police officers want to prohibit the carrying of injuries in public places and raise the age from which a licence for weapons can be obtained, from 18 to 21.
Irina Yarovaya, head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, supported the idea and promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be made to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone's happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by twisting the haze.
There was an open letter on the network, which, the authors of various public small-scale organizations, demanded that the “undue tightening” should be abandoned.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, according to the Russian BBC's forensic lawyer Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 firearms offences registered with the internal affairs agencies were committed in the six months of 2012, compared with 1,168,000 in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of civil weapons legislation does not put the offender on the black market.
Now, according to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low cost.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has claimed to be monitoring the situation with regard to the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Vendors: from factories to officers
The Black Arms Market is being expanded through several channels.
The main channels are five, says the retired colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for 10 years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site receiving weapons orders
The first is an army or military trace, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The guns dragged Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranets.
The next kind of black weapon is stolen by criminals from the security forces.
The Barane explains that this includes both those taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "stools" are on the market from military stores.
In many military warehouses, explosions were frequent.
"There are proven allegations that some of the arson attacks were made specifically to cover the gap," says the former military.
According to Baranza, weapons manufacturers contribute.
“Private weapons factories are now being produced, which do not stand up to competition in the international market and throw weapons from the floor to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert explains.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
There are particularly many guns and machine guns coming from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's production there, sometimes handicrafts, and there's a mafia that's organized the stream," ex-military explains.
Where's the gun coming from?
Experts estimated the estimated share of each source of illicit arms to the black market.
The Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Design prepared a report on this in 2011.
Experts analysed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and the public data of the portals on weapons issues.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, written by researchers, come from the army and the security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market were found there “for the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons”, as stated in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the cases of weapons come from areas of armed conflict, 14 per cent of the cases involve theft during the production phase of weapons, and 5 per cent are in “black archaeology”.
The salesman of one of the weapons stores, who asked me not to name his last name, assures me that the weapons found by the black miners have been too old for a long time.
Most of the time, he says, the sellers are going to the military warehouse for a new shipment.
Through a flagger, a person buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
He's being discharged, passed over the fence.
"He transports her to the city and here he sells 900 euros a grand with two stores," he says.
“Truly, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically, when a plan to solve crimes is on fire, they make control purchases from illegal arms dealers,” adds the consultant.
"As in a luxurious store."
The seller and buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at websites, blogs, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the Bogoway platform, where there's gonna be a man who's gonna take me to the corner where we're gonna negotiate.
It's the only place I knew the value of the gun.
Military observer Victor Baranets
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, says a consultant salesman.
Market salesmen are there, but you have to go there too, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell her that the daughter's tooth fell out."
I'm getting a couple of castes right now through someone I'm sure of.
He only delivers them to me, too, because he knows I won't turn him in.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was writing an article about it.
The charts, he said, have not changed.
They gave him an album with pictures of anything.
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the military remembers.
The buyer, according to Baranz, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential client, don't just buy, we're going with a salesman to the woods, and we're setting a target.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I'm convinced that a weapon hits well, we start bargaining," the expert describes the procedure.
The store on the couch.
Internet searchers are uploaded to Web sites and groups at Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons for "a variety of purposes."
You don't need any documents or personal meetings to do that.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in a commercial cap on the website "Bring a gun or a machine gun."
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
Are they gonna sell them to minors?
"No license of course," asks user Ivan (orphography retained).
"Couple of TT.Moscow" is a cunning "Fedorencs" request.
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of front-sites that want to buy weapons with a shovel.
People walk like hungry fish for food, and then they get coal in Siberia.
Military observer and former military observer Victor Baranets
I've heard of these schemes: normally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer pays through the ATM.
"The answer is a photo and an instruction where the weapons are hidden," says Dmitri Kislov, a spokesperson for the community organization entitled "The Right to Weapons".
Victor Baranets claims that by leaving the application on the website, you can be unarmed and go to jail.
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of front-sites that want to buy weapons with a shovel.
"People walk like hungry fish to feed, and then get coal to Siberia," he claims.
100-dollar macarovs
Experts estimate that the purchase of illegal small arms can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of Right to Arms, Makarov's gun can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from warehouses for long-term storage by the management of these medium-level warehouses.
According to official statistics, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7 per cent from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Fastfood and supermarket workers strike in the United States
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers work at McDonald's.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in America against low wages in Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food networks such as McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendice and Kentucky Free Chicken.
As long as no one predicts whether this wave will turn into the ninth shaft, or whether it is destined to exhale in the early stages.
The shares support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the modest wage increases received by regular Walmart workers and the rapid feeding system, the object of the protesters is to set up trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy has barely been covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The stock started last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales, which captured millions of rogues and sometimes accompanied by fights.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who employ 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picketed with trade unions and left-wing activists the company's shops, whose product is calculated for people of modest and average wealth.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The average product in his shops is 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many low-paying Walmart workers only work at their own workplace.
Walmart is one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods cheaply, partly because it pays its employees little.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of trucks or hand scanners.
The shareholders at Black Friday demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of the insurance provided by the corporation had jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
Typical Walmart employee getting $9.5 an hour, it's a waste they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost corporations $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1 per cent more than she spends on her salary right now.
If Walmart puts the salary growth on the buyers' shoulders, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
They'll spend $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart’s supporters have noted quite well that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any damage to the corporation.
"Black Friday" continued at her shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 goods per second.
A total of almost 100 million transactions were made by its cashiers on Black Friday.
Deng Fogelman claimed in an interview with Huffington Post's left site that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was just a “one-on-one piarov trick” of the union that organized her.
"Free cash register!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart, which is why they are not here, but by the McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even give you sick and pays you for an honest job!
Djumain Williams, councilman of New York City
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Quick food restaurants increase it over time, but not much, and on average, their ordinary employees get $8.90 an hour in New York City.
Nobody earns less in this expensive town.
How can you live in New York with that kind of money, I can't believe it.
The McDonalds used to run almost a quarter of American teenagers who used to work on their counters after school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I'm constantly running into interviews with McDonald's employees, who complain that they should live on that salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum has a comment that notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you're going to feed them for.
The protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of the fast food system start paying at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the fast food sector.
American law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing trade union activists with harassment and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But it is also difficult to reach the union with fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main things is the extraordinary turnover of human resources.
Disagree
Noise protests took place on that day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The event culminated in a midday rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, such as councilman Djumain Williams, said, "Macdonalds" says that he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even give you sick and pays you for your honest work!"
Other prominent New York Democrats supported the demonstrators, such as Bill De Blacio, a candidate for mayor of the city, who stated that “we must be friendly in support of fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.”
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, and not all of them were workers in a fast-distance restaurant that employs tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It's not clear if this spark will produce a flame of mass movement.
"As long as the brain is fooled, it's medium."
The popular theme of modern technology has recently been the subject of the augmented reality, mainly through the lens of special points.
At its annual conference, Google first showed the current model, and then in November it became apparent that Microsoft also applied for the patent.
However, the conversation with the leader of the 3D interactive technology team at the Cambridge Laboratory of Microsoft, Sharam Izadi, suggests that for the company's scientists, the glasses are the stage.
They are enticed by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- What's your research team doing, please?
- We're dealing with machines, but we're trying to spread the boundaries of that interaction.
As long as humanity's masses are stuck in the pixels stage on a flat screen, sometimes with a finger.
We want to look five to ten years ahead and anticipate dramatic changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox device and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect today, because everybody's interested in sign control.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Although Kinect has moved the interaction to a physical level, a lot still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system receives more data) and the output is not very good yet.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
It's definitely not a panacea, but it's a matter of privacy, because you don't always want to tell people about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone's in their own niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not swollen ones, but stingy, short ones.
The gestures were taken not by the camera of the device, but by a handcuffed bracelet that observed the movement of the bones and muscles.
So far, it's big, but theoretically, it can be reduced to the size of the wristwatch.
But in general, the future is a mixed type of control, like a gesture and a voice.
- What's that?
For example, how would you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just saying.
- Oh, it's gonna be very difficult to recognize.
- So you're trying to get users to adapt to what a machine can or can't at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think we're going to have to work on the development of new sensors in the near future that will allow us to better measure human reactions.
It could be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it's very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your concerns about modern cameras?
Missing permission, depth or something?
- In principle, this generation is something that can be resisted in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get megapixels 8 at 1,000 k/s.
But it's not the megapixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
From the last point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, which adds work to algorithm designers.
So you have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also the Z.
Speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are quite small, especially for gestures.
Steven Betices from our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with a controlled processing delay of between 1 and 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I could really use the equivalent of this device in my work, except that I don't need to touch it so I can have more frames per second.
- Don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the other is the receiver of the reflected signal.
And this is the third camera, which is actually the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the amount of calculations required.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the camera curves, and see how this can help in the three-dimensional positioning.
As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present her glasses to the public.
Don't you think that, in terms of the daily use of augmented reality technology, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it's not very convenient to keep a smartphone up in your hands all the time, but I think the coolest option would be a "transient" supplemented reality, when you could switch from a cloud platform to a smartphone, a projection display, and beyond.
The glasses are a very personal device, and that's their strength (the private things you only see), and at the same time the weakness - the augmented reality based on the glasses won't allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Let's just say for a minute that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to a mortal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of such an idea: There is no tactful response!
My hands don't feel anything!
What are the answers your group is preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh biggest breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a substrate for the image.
She's a great pusher!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to give these handbags a touch -- for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located, gives you a feeling, but so far it's very weak -- as if you've been tipped off on your pillows.
There are wrist bracelets that affect nerve endings in the fingers, too.
- Did you try to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he's supposed to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
There's another challenge that has to be addressed for a long time -- how to make a man physically in a very limited space believe that he's going through open, almost infinite -- working on concepts of running tracks (not as in clubs), moving platforms, and huge balloons.
As long as you cheat on your brain as a medium, you still have a lot of work to do for years.
That's what makes the work on virtual reality so appealing to a researcher -- a lot of things in their very infancy.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project “Petersburg Vanguard”, which focuses on the citizens who are in the front, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top list has already been hit by the bright art scenes of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often gaining recognition in Europe, ignoring all Russian popularity.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is an erotic artist, Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, which is found at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the fancy parties, and the vernishes.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds wherever they stand.
Kirill Miller is one of the pure peterburg socio-philosophic storytellers who create new mythology.
Cyril Miller is a bright man in the late '80s and early '90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets as a shiny smile in the city, raising everyone's mood.
Recently, he took the scarlet into his hands and became a peterburger, because he was ripe for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy, and image.
- Cyril, why do you still walk around the city in all red, not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a designer with a view and an image.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and a society.
Although, in society, everything that's a little bit gray causes aggression and arousal.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to a discussion.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in Nevsky D.C., where my work was exhibited.
I realized this was my way.
Then a wave of old, unofficial artists passed, and new, free types of me were unclear.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the posthazone which led to the Pushkin 10, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theater, clothes, music, all the genres, except the word.
It was important for me to find myself at the center of St. Petersburg's culture, where all the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied the territory at Pushkin 10, and there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, and a home of a peterburg boheme until repair was made.
Many of them were born there, the NOMs, Tequila Jazz, and I remember Snura being brought in with the Van Gogh ear project.
The cord and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, they were wearing tight pants, among them the fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became the Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the lead of many programs before the Hali-Galiwi era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and he received basic education and education from us.
The D137 Gallery, the Griboedov Club, is from the Art Clinic.
That's where our workers and the regulars went.
I'm the hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City."
I was named "The Artist of the Year" in the Nomination, and my climax was over.
In new times, it's not easy to work under the old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
It's easy to become popular in these years, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is a familiar manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they're very relevant and sharp.
I'm going to have a software exhibition, the Russian Clown Museum.
Clowns are an extracurricular category.
I used to be social, being like this now is painful and scary.
But it's all smeared in clowns, tragedy is removed.
I love the grotchesk, I have the bigsque ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian dressing in order of order.
Now they're meeting on their clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not on the inside person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in the face.
And the deceit will be removed by dressing.
And recently, we saw you as the city's masturbator.
Who better than me to be.
- Maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now, commercial art must be neat, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are being disintegrated.
People used to fall into packs, the Bohemian loved one, the other.
Now everything's broken into microcommunities, and now it's hard for everyone to like.
I'm not a hundred-dollar paper for everyone to like.
Right now, we need to think about who likes you.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stasa Mikhaylov comes for a few thousand!
- He's got some dumps, and it's a sex-social field that works.
And in cultural terms, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and in the end, less management, money, everything will fade.
I've got fans, and the main thing is, you don't fool them, you don't ruin what you got.
When I was a teenager, I wrote paintings like this that one collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that usually end.
It's a lot of confusion right now.
They say culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, grew up with the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money to paint paintings.
I'm for this kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a concept of a cultural official.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
In the case of the right kings, the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they realized that they needed to keep the right experts.
There's good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're slammed because they need higher experts who will properly appreciate these experts and give them the way.
Now the tastes are flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they're different because they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is Petersburg to you?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital. Moscow has a lot more culture. There's soil.
And it's hard to grow art on our rocks.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers than readers right now, that's not right.
There's a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We've got this layer of thin.
We need to make fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with St. Petersburg grant
Born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with grounders on board are on their way to search for an alternate planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question arises: How can we continue our generation under weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I don't think there's much of a choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be learned hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Senior Scientist of the P.C. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAIS) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more lifeable, the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in orbit of Venus... in space.
Approaching the issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, we experimented with plants.
Four generations of in-orbit peas were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then, in the orbit of the insects, the tiny fruit-drosophile flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how the embryo developed under weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal chick on the way out.
And then there's the problem.
“The problem that this bird needs to find a support, it has to get on its feet and start moving,” explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biological and Medical Problems (IMBP) RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
When the birds did not find their backs, they swerved randomly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not react to light and sound.
And the trouble was, after four days, they just died.
"And we used to stab the chicks twice, and then we refused, because it's just impossible to work with them there," notes the failure of the experiment with the birds in space, Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last biological "mynickiche" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will have only same-sex persons.
There was an experiment with rats who had been sent into space with a fetus.
Basically, there's nothing supernatural out there.
"It was just on the biosatellites, but again it's an isolated experiment, and it's something that needs to be done," notes Vladimir Sychov.
After landing, the cosmic rats had offspring.
But it's not possible to approach the problem of breeding directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, when they lose their habitable habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
A man, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing that humans have is the female organism.
Our Cup flew away, and no one on Earth could say if it would survive a flight into space.
Can she have a baby after this flight?
"There was no answer to this question," says Vahtang Washnydze, a veteran of the missile and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the space flight, Valentin Tereshkov's first female cosmonaut gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev, was also an astronaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitzka, a second female cosmonaut, was born in orbit twice and even in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have enough, there are units of cosmonauts who have been spared after long flights, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if there is more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia Valery Polakov.
Yet, humanity needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The CVC hydro lab is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in a situation of zero floating, astronauts develop their outer space skills.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable, but still alien, then for infants, it's natural.
Little ithyanders seem to confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the fact that the baby's been with her mom for about nine months in an occult fluid, and it's easier for him to get used to water.
Basically, it makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from that first bathing, it's only been two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says the breast swim instructor Marina Axenova.
In short, if the birth weightlessness is more natural for a child, then for a woman, gravity, gravity.
Very quickly, in weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, the pelvis, the ability to push the fetus down.
All right, let's put that down by relying on birth stimulators.
Of course, in a special cell, we can have a baby, she can push him out.
"And then what?" asks the untrivial questions of Valery Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the gravity of the earth, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscle system.
You can't wear a new baby in orbit as an adult in a special training suit.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital.
"And this experiment that you and I are going to do, by allowing a baby to be born in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring to Earth a disabled, completely disadapted person," predicts the head of the IMBP RAN Bioethics Committee, Igor Pestov.
As long as the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while, it will be a reality when the Earthers on their ships will travel to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the General Audit and Audit Office: Checking the Schwartz system failed because of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good monitoring bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, is lagging behind in its implementation.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview with Aktualn.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think is what we're missing," commented on Cal's current situation.
Such findings are provided by a joint inspection of Czech and German monitoring bodies.
As an example of bad practice, Peter Neh hour's approach to the so-called Schwartz system is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the PDP (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is that prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be in any way established and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of institutions that are required to verify and enforce the obligations”, Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, which compared the laws on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly were you talking about?
This is a parallel test that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation affirms how public procurement should take place, followed by national legislation and then also by practical application.
All the information has been collected and, even with an unfinished check, there have been interesting differences - to put it simply, we may have legislation that is “precise and correct”, but in the practice of application, we are in some respects giving way to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to establish more and more refined rules, but to focus on the application of the law itself.
And exactly how does this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this kind of joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to halt the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because it does not lead to positive results.
The economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not a fact that we're going to achieve that by reducing the restrictions on orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with “papers” so that those who want to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction hadn't decreased.
You're talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our HRW (Control and Audit Office) there, or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, there is a Bandesrechtnungshoff, which is based on our principle, and there is also a panel that works a little differently, but mostly both institutions operate in a similar way.
Moreover, the powers are to a certain extent similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the federal level - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounts chambers.
As far as local legislation is concerned, it's easier than ours?
Actually, I wouldn't like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it can't be said to be the best in everything.
Is that because they're better at controlling?
Definitely not, but I repeat, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even model countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't benefit from cooperating with our office, right?
As far as domestic law is concerned, how has the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affected your institution?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been manifest in our monitoring work.
Since we are monitoring the facts, some delay must be taken into account.
We've only taken this into account in the process of preparing future checks -- we've started using our new tool, "Detecting the risk of inefficiencies," through which we ran almost 14,000 government contracts -- we've analysed them -- and, of course, these changes are going to occur because the restrictions are changing, the terms of some types of tenders are changing, and so on.
Do you believe that the adoption of this law would benefit or put additional pressure on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules are “hardened” and cannot be respected.
In previous regulations, controlled enterprises are linked to a supplier (e.g., regional operational programmes - to a regional council) that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in that way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect a decision.
Such a system would only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the HDP would not bother businessmen with the so-called squartz system.
Is the Schwartz System prohibited or allowed?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of bodies that are required to verify and enforce obligations.
You could say, "We're gonna change this law and let it go," but you can't say we're gonna pretend like nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules, as and what should be formally done, and this is correct, and it will protect public procurement.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied in the right way, which I think is missing.
The roads are slippery, but mostly pass.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowed.
They're mostly passersby, but somewhere with more caution.
Carlowarsk Province
This morning, there were passages in the Karlovar border of the road, but some frozen and snowy.
Temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but must warm a little during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, only a small layer lies in the lowlands.
However, about 30 centimeters of snow lies on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it was reported that the spots were less visible because of the fog.
The R6 and first-class roads in the region are now without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be freezing and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to Class II and Class III, including mountain routes, pass through.
However, some of their areas still contain the remains of frozen snow and snow.
We need to be particularly attentive to the roads on the hills.
Pardubitsky and Kralovegradetsk
The Czech Highway and Highway Authority reports on its Internet pages that some roads in eastern Czech Republic are threatened by a holoid, while mountain roads and roads on highland roads may have a broken snow layer.
District roadworkers warn drivers of a hololet that can be formed especially on the hills of the Pardubic province.
The hololine may be near Lanchkroun, Usti nad Orlici, Pollici, Sweetavi or Visoke Mito, especially on the second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Sweetavi are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkonosh and the Orlic Mountains.
The broken snow layer is situated on roads on the hills in the areas of Richnov nad Knezhou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Czechs today, variable clouds are not precipitated.
Temperature usually ranges from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plzensk
The roads in Plzen province are on the way this morning, but the places need to be cautious and adapt to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, some places may be slippery.
Drivers may encounter fog in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by regional roadworkers.
The D5 route is now almost unrestricted, but the road manager recommends caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have dry and extinct surfaces.
In southern Plzni and Takhov, frozen areas may be caught.
The second and third-class roads are wet, and there is also a warning in this case in relation to the possibility of slippery sections.
Drivers should be careful, especially on low-use roads in the Shumawa area.
Olomoucski Land
Drivers travelling on the highlands of the Olomouc region must now take account of snowshare on the road.
It was left after the use of chemicals in the Cervenogorsk saddle and on the road towards Svevisky Krshij.
During the night, the snow caused the traffic workers to go out on the street, according to traffic control information, about three centimeters of snow fell in Schumperka.
In other parts of the border, roads are generally unlimited.
"On the highlands of the Schumper, there's the rest of the snow.
Drivers heading towards Jesenica must bear in mind the presence of snowshake in the Cervenogorsk saddle”, reported today to CHAN (Technical News Agency) the rusperk road control manager.
During the night, their colleagues from Jesenica went to clear the roads, and they assured them that the roads on the hills had remained naked and wet after the chemicals had been treated.
In Olomouc, roads are open, but in Sternberg, drivers must be alert to forest areas where humidity is still present.
Ustetsk, Liberec
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are a few difficult passage points left.
According to the police database, in addition to several places with holold or snowed, the mountain road from Telnica to the Clinic in Ustezka province has been closed.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so there is still snow and ice on the roads, and the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Middle Gorge, are, on the other hand, not a problem, and the roads are mostly dry.
Traffic complications have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the arrival of a holold in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, the conditions for his formation at night were perfect: it rained and melted all day long, the sky was clear at night, and the freeze began.
Disadvantages are reported on the main highway and on track I/13 on the border between the province of Ustezki and the province of Liberia.
The branches of the trees affecting the road themselves were forced to close the road to the Telnica in the Kninica because of the snow.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts, we want to generate positive energy.
What do you think of the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we humans are getting so easily caught in.
Together with the band The Tap, we keep joking about this and saying that we are the only group in the world that can generate enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you're going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you please give more information about this to the readers?
This is a nationwide fund-raising exercise that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, which was announced at 11:10 on December 21.
The day before this event, on December 20th, at 9 p.m., there are three parallel concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, frankly, when the May calendar ends on Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, the hourly belt of which is 12 hours early than we have.
Who came up with this idea?
It was originally my idea, and then we all came up with our painter Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to generate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state of the world we will one day pass on to our children.
At the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of pieces of shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, which can be bought at www.e-tap.cz, and thus also support us.
The Tap Tap band, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world, called "The End of the World" .
Will someone who loves YouTube's listeners sing an anthem at these benefice concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if it eventually works out and the end of the world doesn't come.
It'll be played by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be aired live on Czech television at the same time.
The words to this song were written and played by Jesus in the video by Tomasz Ganak, who is also part of the Xindl X...
How did you start cooperating with them?
We also work with other people in Czech cultural life, as we host many charitable activities and concerts.
We're trying to actively involve them in these projects.
Turns out, a lot of people like to work with us, they're interested.
What's the profit from a concert against the end of the world?
To buy equipment for the STUDEO Free Education Centre, we've been doing this for the sixth year with the Tap civil association at the Institute of Edlikki.
Teachers regularly visit school students at the Yedlikki Institute and have fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the additional construction project for the Yedlicki Institute, a separate building will be created in the future to which we will move with the project.
There will be a number of bands and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We were trying to create a program that would interest all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, the Superport Lesbiennes, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marjan Bango, and Jirgi Souhi will perform.
All details are available at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “randia” activities in the future?
In May, for the first time we'll be performing at the Prague Spring Festival, and here, of course, we'll prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we'd love to have a show at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the United States, would really like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
You've had serious plans about overseas, you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs are supposed to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and toolboxes.
However, as long as we've managed it, the Czech airlines ČSA and British airlines British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which has surprised me so many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, it went smoothly.
By travelling abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities, and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
Since Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, we have seen in Russia that in the east we are still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are many barriers in Moscow, and it is still a wild place for a man to move himself in an electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.
Also, there's no such trivial stuff as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that seek to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, should we constantly catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to make it clear that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own in the streets, to go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
It's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, and that's where we're a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or bareliness is one thing, but at the moment that we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers, things are really going to change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is now very popular, but we'll go back two years, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Yedlikki Institute as an educator, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself and I'm playing a saxophone, I've organized an interesting music club with a colleague.
Well, in time, as our host Ladia Angelovich says, it's a little out of control.
Has popularity come only in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It's true that it helped us to join the famous singers and to work actively to promote the band.
We have come to the conclusion that a job that no one can appreciate is essentially as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you have the goal of making the Tap Tap so good?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
Show business is full of things that follow each other.
It's logical, all new things are taken with caution, and it's going on for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But that pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering and all the abandoned individuals we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities succeed, it's a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Has it been successful that you are a strict guide, as many people think you are?
If we want to do the job qualitatively, we have to be uncompromising in many things and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, attend pre-schools, and spend a lot of time on the road, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
At present, the band is composed of 20 members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there in early 1998?
Only one Ladia Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno at the Fléda Club and in Ostrava at the centre of Plinojem, with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a television tower at the time of the song "The Tap Tape End of the World" ("The End of the World").
The aim of the project is to raise 25 million kroner of funding for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO Educational Centre at the Institute of Edlikka in Prague.
The concert ticket is 400 kroner, the entrance for children under 12 years of age is free, and you can buy tickets at Bohemiatiket in advance.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the Ministerial Meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated actively in a number of Agency projects in the following years.
But Poland began its journey to space much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were on space flights, but that was not always the case.
I recall, for example, a lecture by A. Sternfeld, who presented ideas at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933 from his pioneering work "Introduction to Space."
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, and after a few years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and André Luis Hirsch Award for Induction in Space.
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and space science.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books on these sciences.
Gadomsky became a famous world space propagandist, and his contribution was appreciated, including the fact that one of the craters on the back of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, Poland had built a rocket-powered rail drift.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as did the details of the project.
It's not even clear whether a rocket was to be used to drive the cart or to stop it.
The only information about this is from the press of that era.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has begun to think about missile arrows.
The study was carried out by the Arms Engineering Section, in cooperation with Professors Mogitski and Mégitsk.
The remaining materials show that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photovoltaic fighter rocket, proposed by the engineer Rogozinski, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the work of the author's “Air Torpedo Missile and Aeronautical Bomb” was launched.
Both projects were designed for the military use of missile engines.
Prior to the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasawy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended as a result of the outbreak of the war.
The next scientific work on space has appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towerzystwo Astronomyczne).
For the first time, the issue of society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine “Problems”, which publishes four extensive articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich offered to organize a society that would be involved in space activities.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already under way, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (SOA) has attempted to join the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951), and in the autumn of the PAA has become a valid member.
The following year, the first president of PAA, Kazimez Zarankevich (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in that position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PAA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful Meteorological Missile RM (Raquita Meteorologiczna), which was the first Polish missile to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, which was able to reach a distance of 1,800 metres, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built and, in the summer of 1959, a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested on the Bledovskaya Desert.
The missile was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could have crossed 14.5 km and its mission was to observe the high wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The origin of the first RM-type missiles was a Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed to be two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (specified as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which differ in size for scientific equipment.
The Meteorological 1A missile had a space of 0.4 litres, Meteorological 1B 0.34 litres and Meteorological 1C 0.62L.
The maximum range for all three types of flight was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed a Meteor-2 missile, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile, with a 380 kg launch weight, was able to produce a useful 10 kg load at a height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, under the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashzewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The decree has given rise to a lively debate in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is linked to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted private capital flows, together with unbridled financial speculation.
A significant difference in labour cost (wage) creates price stress.
By this concept, it is necessary to understand the condition of a producer, by delivering a cheap product, trying to resist economic competition by “reducing” the value of a competitor in order to take away most of the market and thus increase his own income.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either moving production abroad, cheap purchases abroad or disappearing, resulting in higher unemployment in countries where labour costs are higher than others.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for its unemployment, the inevitable social spending of the State is on the rise.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of business owners to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage they cause in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Uncertain practices of private capital create situations at the economic level of individual States where national Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their populations in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments are devoting their own populations to private capital arbitrariness, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes to existing legislation.
The aim is to economically force their people to comply with the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a means of curtailing the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is increasing, but the gap between the poor and the rich is also increasing.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, for several years there has been a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
As part of the improvement of the competitiveness of the German economy, there are persistent cases in which employed people receive such wages that the State must pay them more to earn a subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal has become public in the case of the additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in virtually all of the southern EU states undoubtedly result in the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are forced either to emigrate, as in the 19th century, or to live on a low wage at the back of society in the hope that someday private investment capital will enter the country.
But where would it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for the European wage share.
This applies to Latin America as a whole.
Liberal theories and the media claim to be obnoxious that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, and that a managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital persists in insisting that the State should not interfere with the economy.
The next question to answer is, is not private capital now practically managing politics and the entire State for its own selfish purposes?
The answer is yes.
The existence of almost all-powerful and inclusive lobbying in all States is proof.
As a result, we have a desperate situation of corruption, mutual benefit, and legislation where virtually everything deserves to be punished, but is not a crime.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, government ministries, owing to a lack of financial resources, are entrusting the drafting of draft legislation to private law firms that are closely linked to industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as stated in the Western Constitution, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly emerging in a situation as described by Appian in "The Crises of the Roman Empire in Caesar's and Pompey's Days": "The State has long been disintegrated and agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribery, illegal receipt of favors with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibition, and the people went to elections with a pre-sold vote.” ...the good people did not run for the position of ruler at all, eventually one day the state was left without a consul for eight months ... ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As in ancient times, today's society predominates its own reckless interests without regard for the public interest.
Private capital is no longer inherently intended for public use.
The present outcome is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out deeper reforms.
So the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes must be in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the present elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are witnessing now, together with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under pressure from competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution was targeted political and social reforms that would strengthen the State ' s share of the economy, enhance the role of citizens in the governance of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: A lab of chaos.
"There's no way out of violence, and there's no way to get out of it." Sting, the song "Smooth," where the main verse of refren is "we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons hadn't wanted war, they wouldn't have been" - the dying Gutel Schnapper, the wife of Meir Amchel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated many reactions.
Some are in favour of Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians by arguing for the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on who, in these recurrent waves of murder, is a criminal, and who, after all, is the victim of today ' s citizens, including self-governed territories, born at the time of the current political situation, and who has not witnessed the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to see who is first and foremost under the 95-year-old stress of signing the Balfour Declaration in November 1917 on a small portion of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is backed up by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of contemporary history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or whether their throne has been followed by someone who has guided their actions to predetermined goals.
It must be assumed that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from it could not have occurred in a single generation.
One of the astronomically rich families is one that could be seen as a head of fuss (I don't know if anyone's above them, but it's not ruled out) - the Rothschilds.
They don't read much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency, Reuters, was bought in the 1990s to stop rumours linking their name to criminal activities in the higher areas in which they were in the shadows, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the growth of wealth, or both.
They have large shares in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they have no share, they are waging or preparing a war (there were only seven countries before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were five countries after the invasion of Iraq, and there were only four countries left after the overthrow of Qadhafi, but at the same time the Russian Government took over the central bank of its country).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the central bank status of Rothschild Bank of America, and in the civil war he began to release his own (ponimai-government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
John F. Kennedy started releasing his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963, and MP Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for launching the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their yearning for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, created by the Great Masson of the 33rd level, Albert Pike.
The first war was the destruction of monarch states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third was to reduce the world’s population to about 0.5 to 1 billion (the number of slaves would be sufficient to provide comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), the creation of a united universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the eventual seizure of absolute power.
The method used by a group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see FED ' s foundation, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they succeeded in unleashing the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir of the Austrian-Hungarian throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia, starting with the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended with a sudden, unjustified military and economic surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy the royal Russia) and as a result, the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary, was crushed.
To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany, which created the prerequisite for radicalizing the impoverished masses, then left to give the Germans a strong enough to accuse the guilty and to offer simple decisions by the Chief, further to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed played the role of a fifth column, in fuelling the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, and the first confrontations with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
World War II broke out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had broken out of the chains in which he was originally held by bankers, or whatever he had planned, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in concentration camps had created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was formally founded in 1948 and, as Germany was provoked by military reparations for the Second World War, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of war for the third.
If international bankers manage to untie it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will be the victims of fighting on the front line, now with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is responsible for, and who is the victim of, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless cycle of violence if it begins with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we do, international bankers are putting people to vote in elections solely for their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu hawk, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker politician who is doing everything he can to launch a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to escalate into a world conflict, and, given Iran’s control of the Ormuz Strait, which contains 20 per cent of the world’s oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only two miles wide) will also destroy the world economy.
In what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will embrace a new world order?"
The new world order in their vision is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every organism born at birth is implanted with a chip with which it becomes a creature under total control.
"And makes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slave to have a brand on his right hand or forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
Here's the wisdom: everyone with the mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to a human name, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist demon students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammed Reza Pehlewi, who fled after the US revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, there was no positive outcome - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was unable to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations facilitated by the Government of Algeria.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranism at home.
The defeat in Iran has greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with Ronald Reagan's election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America little victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six employees managed to escape.
After difficult periods, they completed their journey to the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover story, which showed them to travel through Canadian passports as members of a survey team looking for a place in the country to shoot a science-fiction epoch.
Combination of genres
The plan that Tony Mendez's evacuation expert invented required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend credible, specialized magazines wrote about the film project, press conferences were held, a fictional manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
Afflek's film is a special combination of a few genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called movie movie-kino-opus, the story of the good idea, the scam -- an example could be a series of films about Ocean's friends.
The film is constantly changing the moods - on the one hand, the documented scenes from Tehran (the titles show symbolic historical pictures of events and how the same situations were shown in the film - there is no big difference).
On the other hand, the lightened Hollywood passages that overlap with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits are talking about the situation at the negotiating tables, at the stairwells of institutions, on the phone...
Ben Afflek was a great success in re-starting his career.
From a mocking actor, he became a respected director, and his game was no longer the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length film, after a dark detective named "Goodbye, baby, good-bye" (2007) and a thriller named City (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film to be filmed in the hometown of the director, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place refers to the qualities that raised earlier films of the director over the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, when real events are rebuilt - the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy are impressed by their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseeableness that arise when the story suddenly changes.
Afflek and his colleagues have a similar effect in fictional scenes (forged headquarters at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many trials in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that narratives do not involve many exciting scenes of film.
He's pretty successful with this little, sometimes he's thinking something -- it's not all that elegant in there (a scene where a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at Tehran airport, and a runway chase looks pretty fancy).
Argo's shortcoming is the dispersion associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are really very charming as Hollywood colleagues, but their characters would deserve more space, and they're not the only ones in the film.
Afflek's film lacks a bit of drama, and it's a film that you can watch with moderate interest, assessing the production and retro-styl that's recreating the trillers of the '70s.
But it's hard to catch up.
This, however, is enough to remind us of one, still in a certain sense of living history, as well as to show how the notions of the almighty and all-knowing intelligence services are exaggerated.
Balloon Inflation Rules, Bananas and Circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, now decides to declare a competition for the “most absurd decree or project from the EU's workshop”.
“We are encouraged by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administrations of large European companies”, said the “Law” organizer Patrick Nager.
Among the absurdities already nominated is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of premiums for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less exposed to risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013,' said Nager.
EU controversial orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which, as a result, is harmful to nature, as well as the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small quantities of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of a chicken cell, which has resulted in significant loss of eggs this year.
The actual prohibition of the use of the term “butter oil” or the exemption from sales of classic light bulbs was also criticized.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The Pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a State or group of States (in this way the Czech Republic now, even under threat, defends the claims of its banks).
The lobby's interests are as follows: for example, the European Union's top-quality bananas were supposed to be 14 cm long and did not dare to exhibit anomalous curvature.
At the same time, the European Commission was justified by merely harmonizing existing fragmented national regulations that made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, had nevertheless relaxed the standards for fruit and vegetables, citing the fact that existing directives would lead to the waste of products.
Last year’s EU regulation that sellable balloons must be provided with a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has approached American research according to which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death by asphyxiation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are prohibited from blowing into fairy tales.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is rather absurd: everyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name Macedonia, but should instead say “BYROM” (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the Liberal Economists' Association, “The Principle of Non-intervention” (Laissez Faire), has proposed to vote, in addition to the above-mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU regulation on the amount of food in the territory of a member State.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food reserves that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the prescribed quantities of canned mushrooms, for which it was liable to a heavy fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of granting subsidies for applications for subsidies.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We ask for compensation from the European Union,” said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palace (PSDP), in autumn 2004.
He argued that the country had a high crop of grain and, as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stocks that had to be removed.
The EU, according to Palas, should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for being far away from the ports.
As a result, the European Commission had approached the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grains from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for a grant were offered to villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Germans (US-DEU), in particular, to apply for a grant from Brussels.
EU: Funny orders are the exception
While regulations in member States are easily criticized, EU regulatory efforts, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the EU, are seen by many experts to be more deserving of recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU grants for projects that do not even imply anything in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member States have achieved in the budget debate.
The Czechs are emotional and that, as in other European Union countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, retained the name Olomoucki cheeses, but the rum, whose traditions in our country are rooted in the 19th century, our producers were to be renamed Tuzemac.
Only can rum be called cane distillates, not sugar beet.
The official list of registered EU products, together with the world-famous “feta” and “horgonzola” cheeses, marzipane from German Lubeck or parm ham, has already been found, for example, in Carlovars, in Gorgjelic and Treshbong carp and in the Ham.
The European Union's trademark can also be proud of the Pardubic carrot and the Gorzy tubes.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura claims.
Mr. Senator, how does it come to a man's mind to run for president?
I'm not thinking about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything in this country worked smoothly, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can't watch the country crucify in the last 20 years, the way thieves fight, the people raise their taxes, and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a way to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and an independent, non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You hit the Senate, but you soon went to the presidential castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I kept saying I'd fight for the presidential castle, depending on the result of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I were elected Senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not to be a position, but to be an instrument by which I can exercise my views.
That's why I need the most influence and the greatest authority.
But the problem is not only that we're a nation murmuring at our bar or at the TV, but that we're willing to trample on anyone who tries to change things.
Adding to this are media that stigmatize people, and that confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jerzy Paroubek.
Let's get to your point of view.
The battle for the presidential castle you started with talking about the material and criminal liability of politicians and about back-to-back property declarations worth over 20 million.
To do so, the law must be changed.
You don't have that power as president, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I lobbied as a citizen for the tour to become a free enterprise, it was advanced.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, they deliberately make obstacles, and it deters citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan person, I have a much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what's best for our country without a party's racking, without looking back at the dogmats, and apply it.
Do you think you're more right-handed or left-handed?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like I'm more of a left person.
It doesn't matter to me at all, a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about someone being on the right, it's about someone on the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society whether it is proposed by the HRCM or the HDP, and I will also oppose a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for the firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
It can be called populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already in operation in the world, or are spoken of by prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will only have slogans.
And with that, you won't last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out and talk to people, you will be able to enforce criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another chance.
Just persuading politicians, journalists and the public and trying to lure them to their side so that we can get what we want.
If I had been elected President, there would have been no problem in organizing a live television broadcast calling on the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they'll have to tell me why they don't want to.
If there is a strong person who speaks abusively, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was the public pressure.
I'm telling you, I'm an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to stand up to my beliefs and beliefs.
I'm just beginning in politics, and for my program, I'm gonna try to get the majority's support.
I'm trying to move things forward on my own; if it doesn't work, I'll be done in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm the only one who's not gonna do anything, so I've been around a number of famous people with a proposal to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchura, he refused because of a lot of work.
I also supported at least the leading investigative journalist Jan Lorentsov, who exposed the fraud of light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel like I'm on the balance.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, and the majority of those who chose representatives of the establishment.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate in such a way that changes will be difficult to implement.
Despite that, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections to mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to check the cleanness of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money to do it.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, and my transparent account is only $20,000.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and what's the status of your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, an art collection of about 10 million, Aston Martin of 3.5 million, and Skoda Superb of a million, and a few more millions in the account.
By the way, Aston-Martin showed up because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove, was galant with women, and at the same time fought against vileness and lawlessness.
You drive aston Martin, you own 60 million dollars of property, and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very persuasive.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Am I supposed to get into debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my pocket.
The campaign costs will essentially cover my senatorial salary.
But I wouldn't live with that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you're going to be doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut it off?
But it doesn't depend on the amount of the salary.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the manager of the travel agency in the spring.
People would have wanted me to be a spareless man who would keep the republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting a month?
From 200 to 400 grand, which is what I'm getting.
And if I were to become president, I'd end my business.
You'll find a full interview on the Saturday issue of Pravo.
MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not just imaginary -- by the example of Spikenisse and his recently built Book Mountain -- two photos.
"This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, at last we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a nearby large enterprise, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we have another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad, and e-books.
No one is willing to go to such old-fashioned libraries now, right?
The Spanishissé, a small sleeping town near Rotterdam, owns an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this unfortunate circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fictitious bridges, which are depicted on euro notes, in the form of painted miniatures of iron beton.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the city's fathers realized that they had the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library here!
Vini Maas, a master of bold column charts and author of witty, sometimes even cynical structures, took up the task with his usual complacency and appeared at a competition audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked around and shrugged their shoulders, the arrogant Maas folded out of his original gift a pyramid of size and completed his speech in defence of his project with the words, "Dear citizens!"
Here's my offer: "The Book Mountain" in Speichenis, so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain grew at a cost of 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalisation project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, mail and several surrounding housing and housing units for a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, "The Book Mountain" was awarded the second award of the 2012 Best Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch national wood competition.
Thus, the faceless suburbs, which had previously been unable to offer anything but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall whose white facades suggest a milk factory, have become richer than one modern piece of architecture.
But the most important thing is that the first public cultural building in the history of this town has appeared in Spikeniss.
A Long Way to A Book
First impression: Book Eldorado under a cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the middle of the mountain, because true architects and readers would prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glassed on all sides - light and easily visible, burnt brick floors and elegant street lights unmistakably create a sense of public urban space.
The urban environment is perfectly rebuilt.
The look is unwittingly looking for bench, dog, and football-playing boys and girls.
And there are books, books, books.
"The usual bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Vinie Maas.
We put the classical configuration of space on top of the head and pulled out the reading area from the outside.
The inner area of the book mountain has been used skillfully: the centre has offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental centre and technical facilities.
The black bookshelves, which serve as wallworks, parapets, and staircases, are particularly refreshing.
Their appearance, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even skilled architects and architects are lost in guessing what the unknown material is.
"We sought to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, a project manager representing the community of Speckenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once, at a single farm in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fibrous material of millimetre thickness has been used as a root pad.
It's cheap and it saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons and can then be discarded.
For the library, this painting, for the first time in these volumes, was compressed in a panel four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, solid material that smells a little like a new car and a little sneaker.
They're leading 105 steps to the top.
Anyone who travels almost 500 meters will be rewarded in a literary cafe, not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wood ficuss in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," says Troubhorst.
The heat of the ground is used for heating and cooling it.
Even though the Book Mount is under a glass cap, the sun only enters for a short time on clear days.
Large wood farms, located perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and take on most of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
Full automatic roll curtains provide the rest of the protection.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned IT scepticist, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was here, too.
And also a traditional Chinese medicine teacher, Cynthia Bogard, who called Buchenberg "the soul of the Spanisse, which has long been lacking."
The reason is that a few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate a book from his own congregation.
These books were supposed to occupy empty spaces on the shelves of the uncompleted library at that time, with 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are to the top.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Vinnie Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, everyone is now in some way connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration.
So MVRDV managed to solve a royal task, which in professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spaikenisse wrote his literary history.
And they may be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for building identity.
Sabo: "The Germans have a more important role to play."
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, the US-Europe liaison expert, Berlin, by doing so, is on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first indicated that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany must now be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without being overly critical of Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the imposition of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO made this offer.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, moving from the policy that the US was supposed to govern to the German foreign policy itself.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are back between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're only finding their part so far, but they're on their way to a more normal foreign policy.
Foreign policy like that of France or the UK.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a national stand independent of the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests are to a large extent different from those of other major States, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to offend the public and elite in the Arab countries.
Either way, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to it, it's not a totally one-sided connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Has Germany damaged its relationship with the US by refraining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe, and even in the US, there is a prevailing understanding of the German position.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
Indeed, it signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, the United States has made clear its support for the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the US and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government, deep down, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But, of course, because of the local political situation, the Government cannot take such a position openly.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as significant as it always seems.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all excited about Netanyahu’s politics.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the EU's most important partner on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germans if there were a single, uncontroversial European policy, but now it is not.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and must instead act on the basis of their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in shaping a common European position.
Clearly, this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have a more independent role to play.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it really take the lead?
Or is Germany still hard to lead?
Germany is not yet accustomed to this; it is still always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German sentiments manifest themselves.
The Germans are not easy to deal with.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the US.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and opinions, which is not easy.
So, the US's influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, it makes you feel uncomfortable or unloved, that's life!

"Secure of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Laurent is also a brand.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a fully officially registered name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from which it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names have sued.
It is also unclear whether they will be able to assert their rights.
“Foreigners are becoming increasingly difficult to defend their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, specializing in violations of trademark rights in the Far East.
There's a new case like this on my desk every week.
Simulators only have to add a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So Gucci is a Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way German enterprises, such as the Puma manufacturer, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the Department of Trademark Registration in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artificial name that also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese are known to be the world's champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights.
There are multi-storey stores in big cities that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However, Pattloch's cases are not the same, and on the instructions of his trustees, he opposes that Chinese enterprises formally obtain from the trademark registration office the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it a Ban Minpai, a passenger brand.
This word is associated with a "ban dacuan."
That's what women call hunting for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not confess guilt
"It hurts business, it must be combated," Pattloch is convinced.
"The brand of commerce is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image suffers very much."
The financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive, copied products.
According to the CLSA Market Research Company, China is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods, with a sales volume of 15 billion euros a year.
However, it is difficult and costly to remove dubious records in the trademark registry.
The process can last up to nine years, with unclear outcomes.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed the claims, since after a long time, the name challenged became “the reality of the market”.
If the plaintiff is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarism because he damaged his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous graphics cases.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction car manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired a Putzmeister concrete-sucker company.
So the Chinese still have the right to use a logo similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo company Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo similar to BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
The fashion producer Lacoste lost in China to the Hong Kong and Singapore simulators who had a famous crocodile looking the other way.
The Chinese authorities don't think they're guilty.
The CTMO Trademark Registration Authority in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 owing to a shortage of staff and facilities.
But last year, there was a "return from emergency to normal in the working process."
For example, the number of pending objections cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been closed, an increase of 75 per cent over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still awaiting processing by the agency.
Fighting it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has, for the tenth consecutive time, led the list of new registrations worldwide, reports the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, to a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
Simplifying this means that each registration is on average worth 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Protesting it is worth many times more, as the case of the German family enterprise Freidenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the firm has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans succeeded in eliminating the illegal manufacture of counterfeit car parts.
However, the simulator reserved Chinese rights to the Freedenberg trademark.
This was a personal omission, since the names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Ventzler, chairman of the board of Freedenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And CTMO's trademark registration office rejected the Munichs' claim.
True, in both of the following instances, Friedenberg has won, but the opposing side is still fighting.
You have to be alert.
The matter is currently before the Supreme Court.
Ventsler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and it takes us a lot of time, money, and nerve."
The internal costs are hardly accounted for, and the firm's archives have had to look at even the acts of a hundred years ago to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Friedenberg failed to offer the opposing side “a large six-digit sum in euros” for settlement.
"It is clear from here how much it costs us," says Ventzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
Specifically, if simulators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freedenberg for footwear and leather products.
The concert had long ceased production in those areas, but it had been able to prevent registration.
"We need to be alert," says Ventzler.
Both he and counsel Pattloch recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark protection provisions, but rather to “all that is worth protecting, to register also in China”, Ventzler says.
Otherwise, it could cost a lot more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay a licence fee for his own name to the opposing party, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise, we will be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Singing, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
A history of relationships that have traveled more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, it's flooding: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, women's boats, and men's boots pick up tactics on the floor and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of singers slowly grow - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - they come, enchant and follow each other.
And Fate Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost pops out of his mattressed shoes when he conducts them with flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Glee Club of Imbong is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years of age, from a human genetics specialist to a janitor, attended the rehearsal.
"Om "Obani" is a difficult thing, every voice in the choir has its own text, and also in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and some parts of Swaziland.
Self - Help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS programme estimates that there are some 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Estgeni, Voices for Africa found chiefs in Germany.
Of these, 70 attend school that prepares for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the lead.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot meal at Gogo Center.
Imbongs in Zulu means a storyteller or a praiser.
They don't speak in this room fluently, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir learns songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they first appeared: southern Africa.
After all, there is the village of Estgeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir, at a distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland.
Infected 40 per cent
There are about 2,000 people, some still in simple huts of clay and straw, and many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the HF virus.
The disease of Swaziland as a whole is reflected in the miniature in Esizzen: the highest level of HIV infection, and the world ' s lowest life expectancy, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the outer flesh of men, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost non-existent among the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland ' s population has immunodeficiency virus in them, and death at the middle of the fourth decade is not unusual.
The Glee Club opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but first the participants saw a large number of children on the streets, lacking not only parental care but also simply food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment by individual participants - for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to allow him to get hot meals once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded a group called Voices for Africa, which has since almost professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Estgeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and tripper.
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are frequent viral STIs.
Frontal pedicule and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mostly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute understands that in at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults have frequent sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidosis (grybok), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly higher among young people than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also have human papilloma virus among our young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the area of genitals, complaints during urination, excretion, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, and bubbles or seals.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you defend yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
In some cases, sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend a regular survey, especially in the case of frequent changes in sexual partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid remote effects.
Chiefship, donations, and not least choir fees all over Germany, make it possible to collect something.
"All we've sent to Estgeny is about 200,000 euros," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is administered by Tzodwa Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also makes sure that orphans are well equipped, such as one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call it in Zulu's old women, is the base of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphaned children to their homes, provide shelter over their heads, and ensure that their children in uniform show up on time every day.
Those who have no relatives go to Hanysila's shelter, a lonely woman who gets paid by the association, as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two henhouses, and co-organized with the American Health Organization PSI HIV testing for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but a disease that is so obvious throughout the country tends to be profoundly silent.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's connected to sexuality."
It's quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love for excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-authorized lifestyle is also responsible for the spread of the HC virus so rapidly in past years.
But it's also on stray workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're barely used.
The other culture is flesh to flesh."
To support a little cultural exchange, the Ibmogoni choir travels every two to three years to southern Africa and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in the black language -- such a recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even happens to have caused tears in front of harsh border guards.
The trip also leads to Estgeni, where the singers visit the children in the underwear.
Despite the difficulty of finding a small village on the map, it is more than known in the Etsulveni Valley.
"Go to Esritgeni, there's light," say the people here.
And after an 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when drowning singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is burning here too.
NASA opens ice on Mercury.
Messinger has found evidence that there's ice on Mercury's planet.
Ice cover can be as thick as 20 meters.
The U.S. Space Agency of NASA has proven that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in a special journal Science.
The Messinger Zone has found evidence that an ice-covered region of the planet is constantly in the shadows.
It must be at least 30 centimeters thick, perhaps up to 20 meters thick.
Supposedly, the water comes from a comet, or possibly an asteroid, that faced Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, says the scientist of the probe, Sean Solomon.
Mercury's temperature can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed for the inhabitants of the Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: little windows to endless ones.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who turns around the sun after Neptune, Ceres, by the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006, is not a planet.

There's no dust in this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was largely hydrogen.
Our View of the Universe: Critical Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersheim, even before Galileo Galilei began to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become larger and the spaces available to them have grown deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror here had a diameter of five meters.
Arizona, U.S.A., has a Big Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
Grand Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device, the diameter of a mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The Great South African Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to reduce the cost.
Nevertheless, it reaches about 11 meters in diameter.
Lack of affordable design: the telescope is rigidly fixed at a vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its speciality: high light-enhancing ability.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With a radiotelescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Project for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing its computing power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
There's a very large telescope here, completely consistent with its name.
His four mirrors allow the visual tube to illuminate even the average infrared spectrum.
A European “Very Large Telescope” is also planned to be installed at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
His main mirror is supposed to spread up to 42 meters, and it's going to be made up of almost 1,000 mirrors.
However, photographs should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano, Mauna Kea, were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into the sky through the Subara and IRTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a 30-metre diameter mirror, should appear on Mauna Kea.
Here they can be admired for the illustrations.
However, the most important species in space supply the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has provided paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, Kepler's space telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, especially those where life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photo captures the latest designs of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be sent into space until 2018 on board the Ariane 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice on the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence of this, as Messinger is moving closer to the North Pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have shown that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messinger probe launched in 2004, the first one that revolves around Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink oil every day and live until you're 168 years old.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of honorable age in the Bible.
There's even a longevity museum here.
Finding a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
Traveling through the Talich Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
A booming minibus rolls on a swollen road past densely forested hills, stormy rivers, and ordinary peasant homes.
Everything's so green and bright, you might think you're in Schwartzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers from here.
This is one of the peoples of the Caucasus that is known little, except that they speak perfectly Farsi and Azeri and have longevity.
The final point is Lerick.
A small town raves over the heavy architecture of Soviet times, which is completely incompatible with the beautiful mountain landscape.
European tourists hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, since the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, to the province, has not yet arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulayev (48) is convinced that there is much to interest tourists in Lerick.
"In May Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Festival -- and next year we'll have the world's oldest people festival," Fatulaeva says.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
There's a biography of about eight dozen pellets from these places, over 100 years old, Fatulaeva points to a black and white picture.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But the controversial star of the museum is the Chaban Shirali Muslumov, who is allegedly 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest man whose age is documented is 122 years old, the age of Muslumov is extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did the Chaban Muslums add a couple decades to their age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher of age at the Max Planck Institute in Rostoke, has heard of longevity in Central Asia.
"A strikingly large number of older people can also be found in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "there are also extremely many very old people living in Sardinia."
However, because of the lack of documentation, it is not possible to provide scientific proof of age, as there were no civil status registers.
Every day a glass of hot butter
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the area of Lerick are astonishingly often reaching Bible age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age living here.
Why are there so many long livers here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide, Farid Mugimzade, explains this by the special genomes of talyche.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes it's about nutrition.
Tulips like meat, bread, and the most dairy products, many of them drink a glass of hot oil every day, but I don't think this high calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
In Chengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerick, Rubaba Mirzoeva lives.
At 97 years of age, she is relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter that she's not tired of driving back and forth.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one son and daughter of Mirzaeva, who have long had their own grandchildren.
There's also two kids riding around.
There's tea in the kitchen that's served in typical bubble cups of armood.
Mirzaeva's teeth are perfectly smooth and strong, and under her headkerchief, she hides the long, dark-red braces that her son proudly opens before us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I never used shampoo," says Mirzaeva.
Monthly pension is sufficient for living
She always ate what grew up in her own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought any groceries in my entire life.
She then tells of her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest was after World War II.
But it was better when Haydar Aliyev's "love father" took over.
Propaganda doesn't often come from an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, has virtually no borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, followed by his son Ilham.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani elders.
230 manats (about the same amount as the euro) Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions it is an amount that can live well.
And perhaps the long-growing son of Mirzaeva is also right: "Old people in our culture have deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, cared for, and happy.
What is not a reason to stay alive for as long as possible?
The word “human rights” is not included in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo reflect a deep division of the country.
The future constitution, based on the Shariah, had met with fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president didn't sting for the pafos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success rests on my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but first and foremost to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
Indeed, all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are fearful.
Fear of the religious state on the Nile on the mercy of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi, almost apologizing, said that he temporarily reduced the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his jurisdiction “to save the revolution”.
But what really wants to save a 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. at the University of Southern California is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be powerless?
In fact, 234 articles have been dragged into a 15-hour night race with obstacles to an Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a matter of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that judicial proceedings are based on the “principles of Islamic law”.
But what do you mean, "principles"?
This has been and continues to be a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use vague language and the resulting legal lufter to better interpret the sharia.
At least one new article suggests this: in all sharia cases, the Al-Ashar University Council, the country ' s most important Islamist institution, enjoying great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be involved.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy is in charge of the law, which would de facto result in the restriction of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, much is being interpreted
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to a military court must remain.
These courts, during Mubarak's time, served to suppress the opposition.
Up to 11,000 civilians were held in military detention after the dictator was overthrown.
Also, as the draft states, the State must protect the “true nature of the Egyptian family” and “support its morals and values”.
This is so vague in legal terms that government agencies will be able to control even the content of films and literature through this article.
It means, in an open text, nothing but censorship.
No article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
The other forbids insulting and defaming the prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It was also questionable what was prohibited from “intimidating people”.
Will it be enough to caricature a president or a joke about a legal scientist?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in the draft, which Mursi proposed for signature and which he said would be submitted “very soon” to the Egyptians for referendum.
"The Revolution Returned."
The opposition against Islamist superiority has been forming for weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who held third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the international nuclear power agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution was a place “in the dump of history”.
Through a short Twitter news service, he accused Morsi's adherents of wanting to lead a "putch against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we shall go to his palace and cast him down," said the opposition, Yasser Said.
"We're not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged," the Egyptian media quoted Khaled Ali's opposition policy.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but not at Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile, to the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under covers and Salafites who shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded Mursi to clean the country, and they said, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which everything began has provoked a state of virtually civil war.
Mursi’s followers obviously did not want to take that risk.
Muslim Brotherhood stated that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loudly and clearly.
Now it is time to let the people decide from the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
Most for the Islamist project, it's considered a done deal.
"The notion of human rights is never mentioned."
Hafiz Abu Sayeda is furious about this violent constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHO) defended Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or tried under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their world view, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this, he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never appear in the new constitution, and he regrets his conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The increased influence of Mursi on all three branches of government in the State disappoints the lawyer.
These measures are clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“In lieu of strengthening a civilian state, the President de facto annulled it”, Saeda regrets.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Sayeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which is looking at the ideological struggle of the directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be a payback.
A protester at Tahrir Square warns, "You're creating a monster you can't control."
Norwegian Racfisk: The worst-smelling fish in the world?
The five million Norwegian people have one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but worldwide.
Perhaps the mystery of this country's success has something to do with the local addiction to one extremely stinky fish dish?
Take a few overfrequent pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're gonna have the smell of raqfic, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's beautiful, but there's an indestructible smell in the air.
Racfisk is a trout stained with salt and wandering in the water until a year, depending on what kind of sweetness you're going to get.
As the darkening and coldening gathers, a crowd of Norwegians gather to the festival in Fagernes, dedicated to this very, let's say, exciting dish.
"She's eaten raw and drunk with a drink of aquevite, a local dark vodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter who runs the festival in his profession and part-time “racfisk general”.
All around us, people eat fish cut in small cubes and drink it with a lot of alcohol.
"Someone likes aquavit rather than a raqfic," says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not so bad, it's not much different from the sushi you've been carrying on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, a time of poverty, when, even before the fridges appeared, fish were soaked in hermetically sealed barrels of salt water in the autumn.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish were well and thoroughly swept away, it was extracted and used to depress the perception of alcohol.
Even in the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States.
The population is now growing rapidly, with more than 13 per cent of immigrants being attracted by jobs, high wages and a well-developed social security system.
The people of Sweden (a longtime rival and not so long ago and a much richer neighbor) come to work here.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, indistinguishable, though somewhat sinister, of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it's expensive. A little beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 (14 U.S. dollars).
Norway rarely appears in the world’s news, and most of the country’s inhabitants seem to be satisfied with this.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Bravik, a right-wing racist and extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called the July 22 incident.
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens has been able to commit such atrocities and killings.
Norway ' s current well-being is based on the growth (from the beginning of the 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil isn't the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, a diverging tray with sterile cancer, a woman with long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it, a wise man.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks excellent English.
We don't like to show up, we're not bragging.
Norway is very careful with its oil – most of the oil and gas revenues are invested in a special fund established for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all the money they had not had wasted, Norway carefully calculated all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and go camping in the summer, that's enough for happiness," Anna says.
"And there's a raqfic," she adds with a careless laugh.
I'm standing in line for some food in the snow. I'm done with the cancer.
A hamburger with salmon meat is definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening, we have more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel hosts a special raqfic dinner, during which visitors determine the best or possibly most aromatic fish.
There's a live TV show showing the host in a bow tie surrounded by raffinise plates.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what's your score for the best fish in your mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our score."
Everybody laughs and applauds.
Someone falls off a chair, probably over the aquavit.
Or maybe just breathing the smell of that fish.
President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico is facing a difficult start in his career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
The traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly poor state.
The city has been overburdened by traffic at a better time, and steel fences have been erected since Monday, cutting several key roads to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from entering the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will put on a presidential bandage and take over the country.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which was now assuming power, but the country had been caught up in a war against drugs, which had already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government declares to the people of Mexico its readiness to combat violence”, Mr. Peña Nieto told US President Barack Obama earlier this week in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto’s political career as governor of his home state of Mexico City was developed alongside the President of the United States.
In his home country, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
A straight man.
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents commend him for the revitalization of tourism, the development of the resort and the development of infrastructure.
One of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto can be reached by the city, which is quite different from those of the scavengers and pits that were previously in the area.
His name is on the modern building of the sports centre and on an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We have the hope of real and serious change with him,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman from the Pianya Nieto Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that our country urgently needs, especially in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous power, the PRI party was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos Presidential Palace, the party has placed great hopes on Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refutes the allegations of lack of self-intention made by the opposition to the new President.
It is very direct and very committed to the realization of its vision for the future of the country.
He's an excellent statesman, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast with the paved streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under motorways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in this mega-city.
Earlier this year, troops had been recruited to curb drug-trafficking gangs in those areas, and violence against women was particularly acute.
Several dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near an extensive landfill in the last two years alone.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico during Mr. Peña Nieto ' s governorship, a figure far higher than that in the notoriously violent town of Ciudad Juárez, whose name became negligent when it came to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto ' s opponents, he could at best be said to have been unable to deal with the problem of killing women during his tenure as Governor.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house, which looks like most of the houses in this cluttered area, Irenaea Buendia struggles to withstand the tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Mariana, she committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her roommate killed her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed like her body had been washed before," she recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body was already frozen.
Mariana's mother recounts this story, and the picture of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion, on which only one word is written: justice.
This is what they said the family was denied.
"The state's officials treated me like an old gossiper, dissatisfied with an intruder of peace.
They want people to just believe everything they say and keep quiet.
But it's wrong, it's not right, especially when there are so many irregularities and flaws around you,” she says.
After wearing a presidential bandage on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
Tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence in the past six years, and the new President has promised to make this a priority during his reign.
"I hope he'll be the same president as the governor," says Olvera, Congressman of Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Ness are most concerned about.
Bradley Manning wasn't complaining of any ill-treatment, he claims.
The prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, emphasis was placed on Manning's stay in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence demands that the case be closed on the ground that Manning's detention conditions were harsh.
The U.S. Army is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said he had been forced to endure while in military detention.
During cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Mid, Maryland, the Military Prosecutor, Major Ashden Feyn, stated that the records of the weekly visits to Manning by the prison authorities in nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the defence motion to discontinue the Manning case, on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment, was carried out the day after Manning stated that he had intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is charged with stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the WikiLeaks web site.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Fain, along with Manning, reviewed the reports that had been completed following the visits to Manning by the Administration during his stay at Quantico prison, where he was held under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he regarded the prison administration's treatment as “excellent” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized”.
The reports examined do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was explicitly asked about his conditions of detention, Fein claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed verbal concern about these issues and that the Administration ' s visiting representatives had discussed these issues with him and had stated that they would deal with them but had not recorded them in writing.
"They recorded "no problems" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise the subject," Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lindh, also asked Manning why he had not complained of ill-treatment in January 2011 during a meeting of a commission considering the suicide intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to be removed from the “injury warning” regime and eased the conditions of detention.
The military authorities explained that the limited regime of detention, which was lower than the suicide control regime, had been introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm all right to have them cancel the injury prevention regime... so that my standard of living would improve, in my view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been arrested in Iraq and transferred to Kuwait, where he had been held for almost two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait and that he had lost consciousness once because of the heat.
He explained that it is psychologically difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is handled and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world is cramped to Camp Arifjan's base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was going to die in this cage."
While in Quantico, Manning said that he spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day -- alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a blanket, slippers, some clothes and glasses.
He says that he tried to move because sleeping, or even lying down during the daytime, prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly hit by a light coming through the outside of the cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he was turning around in bed at night, he said he was woken up and forced to turn on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed an official objection to the abuse of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about the statement he made during his statement on Thursday that, after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners during the morning inspection.
Manning said he couldn't cover himself with a blanket during the check.
In answer to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said that he had learned from the guard's order that he should throw a blanket to cover for himself, but he admitted that no one had direct orders to leave him.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reported that he told the officer he could use a pair of underpants or slaps to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, his slippers and his glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had endured during his detention and significantly reduce the sentence if Manning were found guilty by a military court, which was to begin his trial early next year.
The defence stated that it planned to invite Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes, and that other charges would be challenged as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of those arrested under the strictest possible regime.
The charges brought against Manning include aiding an adversary, illegal promotion of data on the Internet, transmission of information relating to national defence and abduction of State property or documents.
If convicted under all counts of indictment, he could be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans had been forced to leave Mexico for lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are breaking up between two cultures.
During a recent visit to Mexico City, I walked through the incoming corridor, approached the border control area and froze on the ground.
The signs pointed to two queues: one for Mexicanos, one for Extranjeros.
I stood in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and they used to call me Mexican.
It's just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
Later, I focused on the complex design of "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than my tongue, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and got in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered that story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The issues of immigration, drugs and trade that were common to the Presidents of those countries were on the agenda.
President Peña Nieto was willing to speak of the rise in the Mexican economy, which would make it possible for Mexicans to stay in Mexico as well, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and create a North American trade block like the EU.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and resentful issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and, at gunpoint, forced its leaders to abandon half of their territory.
But the Mexicans have been thinking for centuries, not minutes, and they see the reminders of those events in everything.
So if only any U.S. statesman speaks a word of criticism towards Mexico, the press, and the elite of Mexican society, there are complaints that Americans are violating the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with war.
The most difficult, however, are Mexico’s relations with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about resentment?
That's enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in this country, and those who don't.
In L.A., Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin are only for one reason: at some point in their family history, someone, a father or a grandfather, was unable to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often, they were Mexicans of a certain type -- dark, poorly educated, poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
That's not what they see in Mexico.
Today, our lives are the embodiment of an American dream, we've been in good schools and we've got good jobs, but we can't forget that even that dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider to be its own.
United States of America.
Besides, we know that most of the Mexican elite and ruling class don't like us.
We say the same to them.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats, and they treat us as second-class people, as non-real Mexicans.
We speak not enough Spanish, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind a silk curtain now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing our spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the U.S. when she was a child, and this reminds me that there are tensions between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, and Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Mexican Americans are offended.
She's a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances are of Mexican origin and do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican band Los Tigers del Norte, but we love Bruce Springsteen.
Having the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I learned on my trip, as if our relationship was already not complicated enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore their relationship with the diaspora.
They want Americans of Mexican origin to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too much resentment in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country to be so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but take care of this yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unable to forgive the United States, what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still resented for the recent treatment of their relatives in Mexico.
Yeah.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas faction can provide a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
It was a familiar, pointless debate about who had started; many buildings had been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, the majority of whom were civilians, and six Israelis had been killed; and, for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip had fallen in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the hopeless links between Israelis and Palestinians in their perpetual conflict, the Middle East has changed.
This can be seen in different ways, but the events of the Arab Spring have converged in a rioting storm with many established realities, and the Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay away from the whirlwind that shocked the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons for hope of overcoming this deadly impasse.
A War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, is being implemented, the clashes this week have only reinforced the positions of the factionists on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will claim to have forced Israel to retreat despite its losses.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the faction have been destroyed and 1.7 million people have been blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled parts of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements grows in the Arab world, Hamas has new powerful and rich friends.
The emerging regional leader of Turkey, who once was Israel’s closest ally among Muslim countries, expressed support for Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic States in the Persian Gulf.
Hamas’s solemn supporters claim the establishment of an Islamist semi-month around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by the Hezbollah paramilitary group, to Syria, where the increasingly pro-Islamic rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad’s power, and further to Jordan, where the king’s authorities threaten Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was strengthened under President Mohammed Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay much attention to Hamas support.
On the other hand, the Muslim brothers are an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more populist.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas can become a meaningful player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the hard line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In the military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli Iron Dome missile system justified the cost of its establishment and successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
Israelis can sleep quietly, at least for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the US has remained steadfast; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the last round of violence.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the Government of Binyamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that, since 2004, some 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has been able to minimize the suicide problem, partly through the wall that enters the West Bank, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the elections scheduled for 22 January, has merged with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Liberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of condoning the Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If they were to hand over all the authority in the West Bank, would they not start launching rockets from there towards Israel, as their brothers in the Gaza Strip did?
It's better to keep them out of the wall and severely suppress any attempt to lift their heads.
Proponents of the hard line may be victorious; however, their calculations may be refuted in the Arab spring.
While Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not very fond of Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence portion of Israel's budget is larger than all its Arab neighbours combined.
The outbreak of war with a regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments strengthen their own economies.
Pragmatism by President Morsi of Egypt, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, to the same extent, bear in mind the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes erupted in the Arab countries, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination constituted a time bomb that would explode sooner or later in the occupied territories of Israel, like the bus that had exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression already undermines the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
The bloodthirsty operations carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas have to be paid for by the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need an external impulse.
There remains the only solution that is unrelentingly called for by sound representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States and Israeli concessions in exchange for security.
The hope remains, not too impressive in the short term, that a ceasefire will enable other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which is long overdue in its decision to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has a more favourable position than ever before to persuade Hamas to recognize the boundaries of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries must also work towards reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah.
That would do more for the establishment of a Palestinian State than the upcoming vote in the United Nations, which could result in recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to show reluctance to engage in the solution of the problem.
This is a catastrophic short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The Unified Packing for Cigarette Act has entered into force in Australia.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and the images of disease-affected body parts are contrasted in depressing green boxes that are the same for all cigarette stamps.
The first Australian law on the same package of cigarettes and tobacco products entered into force in the world, replacing logos and colouring of different stamps with an identical box of depressing olives with depressing pictures of sick body parts and images of children whose health is undermined by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions that warn against the dangers of smoking, the only difference between packets mandatory from this Saturday is the names of stamps, which are printed in the same small font.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for the packaging of tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to deter young people from smoking by depriving them of this harmful fashion habit.
This decision was based on research that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26 in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
“It is obvious that even at the youngest age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging”, explains the Minister of Health, Tanya Plybersek, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children's idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest share of smokers in the world, so that these changes will not have a significant impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
The tobacco industry has strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes are sold.
"This law will have serious consequences, different from what was thought of by its proponents," Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Forged producers from China and Indonesia will supply much more such products for sale on Australian streets.
For some, on the other hand, new laws promote business growth.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that demand for cigarettes and silicon caches that hide unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (practicably from zero) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their case in Australia's High Court, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 products to wholesalers and is waiting for a new shipment.
It's a good business for us.
Experts believe that the popularity of social networks among the target population is a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
Following the passage of a number of laws in Australia that have made illegal television advertising and support for sporting activities, as well as prohibiting vendors from displaying cigarettes in the public domain, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government has banned local companies and websites from posting advertising online, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you're selling tobacco and you've only got this little loophole left, the idea of promoting your product on the Internet would seem very tempting to you," explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of brand reviews written on behalf of supposedly common users on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the work of a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he's spared his energy and time and made a video, or is it the advertising company behind it?
British American Tobacco, Australia, claims that the industry is now more engaged in adapting to new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States have filed claims within the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that trade relations between all these countries and Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plybersek, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory photographs of the dangers of smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering the possibility of tightening their laws.
A large number of smokers in Australia do not respond to innovations.
These pictures don't hurt me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"Just grab a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, buying cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on a pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, manager of the tobacco store, King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that the same package has made it more difficult to place the goods on the shelves.
"Before I had an hour to unload the new shipment, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, "we would have said, "what to do, okay, it's over, we're closing the store," he says, "and he's putting his hands up.
Missing in a world of electronic networks and constant connections isn't that bad.
On this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical malfunctions and was replaced by another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and it won't help much with books, magazines, iPhone, or even duty-free shops.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and professionals in child development have spoken out in favour of boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not so bad for us and for our children to miss.
This causes the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we're all constantly in front of a screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we should try to get bored.
Yeah.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many, that boredom is an invention of relatively recent times, when people have more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, author of the book Boredom: A Live History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient story," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii, Latin boredom is found, dated from the first century.
However, the question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying studies on the subject and asking a question to a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people “want to but cannot do what pleases them”.
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn't do anything he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing in the boredom, he says, is "disruption and the resulting deterioration of the mood and the feeling that time is moving slowly."
According to the description, boredom may seem very depressive.
However, Professor Eastwood claims that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and in the circumstances, while depressed people see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel we're bored when it's really hard to focus on something.
In his study “Unoccupied Mind: Defining Boring From the Perspective”, published in the September issue of People on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment that had listened to a recording of a voice reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard the loud noises of an unrelated television program in the next room, others heard the same sounds on low volume, so that they could barely be rectified, and a third group listened only to the recording of a voice without a foreign sound track.
Those who heard a low-volume TV noted that they were bored, more often than others -- they had difficulty concentrating, but they didn't know why, and they attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an adjunct professor of neurology at Gwelph University, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, by looking at the flow of goods on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It's supposed to continue that when people start rocking on a chair or painting caracules on a piece of paper, they do it from boredom, but now we know that, in fact, this kind of action is just helping not to relax physically.
"The study showed that children who are not forbidden to grovel and spin learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we're all bored: in the delay of the flight (as in my case), listening to a monotone speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
However, different people show varying degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “charter of boredom” to measure such individual characteristics.
Questions and assertions, such as “Much of what I have to do is uniform and monotonous” or “I'm too interested, so there's not enough time for anything”.
Through such questionnaires, researchers have determined that boys miss girls more often,” says Stephen Odovic, professor of psychology at the University of Western Florida, especially with a variety of external irritants.
In general, however, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day with a pager.
He obtained the following results: 32 per cent of teenagers said they were bored in school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3 per cent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson points out that he has no information on what such data would be about boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescence has a peak in boredom”, mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extremes, research shows that it can induce people to commit absurd and dangerous physical acts, gambling risks, or substance abuse in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the relationship between boredom and creativity, says Professor Odovic, who devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; this is boredom," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, the brain itself does not always know what to do better.
If you're bored and you direct that energy to guitar games or cooking experiments, you'll do better.
But if you start watching TV, you'll only get better for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he'll stop bored, but he won't learn to fight boredom on his own or otherwise manage his time and employment,” Professor Fenske says.
“And such self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations”, he claims.
Your child learns not only to be self-conscious, but also to be self-conscious at all.
I don't think boredom should be exalted in any way.
But it's not worth considering it a bad thing either.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even outside a continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it in such a way that we need to experience more boredom, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insurmountable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get off the clock and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to the constant overstimulation of the senses," he says, "and when silence comes, we lose our senses and we don't know what to do."
It is not clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana will be applied in Colorado.
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football player and a social college student in the south-east of Colorado state, is accused of committing a criminal offence, which will soon be completely legal throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and the tube he smoked it in.
Mr. Orosko said that he and his friends had been in Lamar once in September and were driving a car through the prairie near the border with Kansas when they were stopped by the police.
After the policeman found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco was summoned to court for possession of drugs and possession of drugs - minor offences, each of which was punishable by a fine of $100 - and the date of the trial was set.
"We are treated like criminals," says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has lasted weeks since Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, hundreds of small cases depend not so much on the law as on the place of the trial.
Charges for minor marijuana offences are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken similar action.
Police stations have already ceased to press charges against people aged 21 and over for possession of small doses, which will become legal once the law enters into force within a couple of weeks.
However, in more conservative districts in Colorado, prosecutors have decided to deal with existing marijuana cases and continue to be held responsible for possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West, there is a vote to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from entering their places.
"All of this is developing so fast that I don't even know what to expect next," says Daniel J. Outs, chief of police in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Members of the control agencies in Washington state are also puzzled to scratch their heads.
They will have to establish regulations for licensing the production, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which should be done before 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“In Colorado, a more orderly market, so it will serve as a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Board for the Regulation of the Production and Marketing of Alcoholic Products in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than make some suggestions and hope that it will work.
"We don't have a real precedent to focus on," he says.
The Washington State Bill, named I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will put the State in a state of uncertainty for a whole year when the State licensing system is not yet in place and marijuana ownership has already been legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to strike a balance between the state's regulation of “adequate access” to licensed marijuana, which is prohibited from selling 1,000 feet away from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses in urban areas, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs”, explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of the recently established research group “Centre for Legalization of Marijuana”.
On 21 November, the police chief of Oates from Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinates that the city's prosecutor's office would no longer hold persons who had reached the age of 21 for small quantities of marijuana, and that the police would stop incriminating people of these violations “from now on”.
The Chief of Police, Oates, reported that the police would monitor compliance in the city with the rules governing the activities of drug growers and prosecute drug traffickers and distributors.
The Weld District Prosecutor in North Colorado, Ken Buck, presents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After a vote on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to prosecute the possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage users to undergo treatment.
Currently, 119 persons are charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also charged with other violations.
“The duty of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission”, said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was mixed even in places such as the Mesa village, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer prosecute adults for possession of a small amount of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Houtzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop charges in the already open marijuana cases.
"I believe that it is our direct duty to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Despite the fact that 55 per cent of the people in Colorado who voted supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the State and the legal system will not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different states has revealed ambiguities in the attitude of local authorities to the state's marijuana experiment.
“The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this regard”, explains Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing convicted marijuana possessions, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've been stalking people for this for so long that they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana like alcohol, are destined to be a country-wide pilot field to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Proponents of legalization and state officials are planning to expand legalized trade, but at the same time they are anxious to await instructions from the federal authorities, who are still planning to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hoped that the Department of Justice would give up on the matter.
Despite several high-profile arrests of drug dealers and patients using marijuana on medical grounds, the federal government has in most cases approved the sale of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, D.C., and 16 other states.
Anti-drug agents are unlikely to break into their homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to state-controlled recreational marijuana stores, which are authorized by the new law, Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for federal action.
Even before the presidential elections, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops that could not have opened before a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the sale of marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a position as to give someone a license, and then it'll cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a city councilman.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was survived by Oxford for being a conservative.
The harassment of university students for their views did not start today.
As long as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford.
My father and older brother went to Oxford and described it as the world's best educational institution, a modern analogy to an ancient symposium that lays the two pillars of civilization: freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the Faculty of History at the University of Oxford University College of Wooster in the late '80s, I packed my suitcases and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it, and he cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer, E. Norman Wilson, joked that I left because I had to drink out of squirt cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically molested and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or because I was in private school.
I was poisoned for only one reason, and in this glorified cradle of enlightenment, it looked like a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser, Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a conservative supporter.
You're asking, why do you have to think about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students with a right-wing attitude is subject to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that accorded to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the Christy College College Club in Cambridge claim that they are “frequently isolated, personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome” because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the College ' s Equal Rights Committee in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was exacerbated by a recent documentary on BBC 2 on student politics, "The Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right", in which conservatives were portrayed as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who rides the rolls rois, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver nabaldash.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are made of them as “a scapegoats because of higher tuition fees”.
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice President of the Conservatives Association of Nottingham University, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that "in the university environment, there is a growing bias towards the left.
People who don't even know us think we're pre-conceived and violent children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in the history department of Christy College, in which a request for enhanced protection was filed, calls such an atmosphere "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, says that the attitude of the student club members towards the rights-centricists has significantly deteriorated.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate, as well as to the normal life of the members of the club," she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just a minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a timid and shy 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford fevered from hate to a conservative party.
One year earlier, the university had voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary status, owing to a reduction in the budget for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of a freshman’s week, when students met each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time that I had been waiting for me.
I didn't know that teachers not only looked through their fingers at the harassment of conservative students, but that they also enjoyed participating in it.
Political issues - a mine strike, privatization and government opposition to the imposition of sanctions against the apartheid Government in South Africa - entered the wooden walls of audiences.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the 18th century French text into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I stuttered.
Harry Pitt was a very gallant man with a face that looked like cake.
"The Tatchers don't teach French in principle, or do they just lack brains?" he asked.
The other students were fascinated.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take some fresh French lessons in your spare time, unless you're very busy in the community," Pitt.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I sat alone at lunch, and then someone slapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from English, who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservatives Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Anyone who is suspected of being sympathizers with conservatives will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most first-year conservatives pretend they're Labourers."
Later, in the local pub, I tried cowardly to hypocrite.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work out.
A first-year student at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up on his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
- They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like I must have felt like homosexuals before the criminal prosecution was lifted in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or am I only going to have to meet my fellow men under cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a laborer and to hide my true beliefs?
The coming three years began to seem like a hell full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speechwriters.
He barely showed up in college.
He despised him for his provinciality, pettyness, and commitment to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents’ home in London, seeking refuge among relatives and unbiased capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the fortieth years, any political views were adopted.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said complaining.
- They can't do anything like that, except in a town of sleepy spikes...
Even my Communist friends have always been impeccable."
His wet eyes are blurred.
"Don't make any hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was exhausted on a permanent trip to London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a conservative, did not withstand pressure and gave up his beliefs.
Next week, during the seminar, when another history teacher seriously called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the shower, burning with shame, I confessed that my parents brainwashed me, and I called them "old fools."
It wasn't a long break.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was meant to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Murdock.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later, my stalkers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a cripple and a rag.
But at the age of 18, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford, who not only released the 14 Tori prime ministers, but is still hiding behind the unserviceable reputation of a university that values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory."
ABC is talking to Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other prominent Italian designers about the Valentino Sewing Master, which opened this week in London.
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, the only place in the British capital worthy of receiving the Valentino Garawani exhibition.
The designer admitted this at the opening of Valentino: the Sewing Master, a triumphal retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high-mode dresses created by his home over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is Garawani's "or signor", but it could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of nobles.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, personal letters and photographs are abundant, signed by the most distinguished aristocrats, from Princess Salima Agha Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Shantal, the Princess of Greece, and Margaret, the Princess of Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social uplift, from a humble tailor from Vogera in northern Italy to the idol of the international elita.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
"They at least don't smoke their cigarettes on your beautiful rug, as some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an excellent host and receives guests with generosity and elegantness.
"We all enjoyed coming to his chalet in Gstaad," explains Tissen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Angelly or Evgeny Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred the elegantness of glory.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, remembers the charismatic modeler.
Once we went to his house for dinner, it was after a fashion show at the Spanish Square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Valentino's style appeared in everything-- every detail of his apartment, her cleaning, her food, his music.
"Everyone of Valentino's guests made him feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began working with a modeler in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He's never out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art," she finishes.
Ancestral parade
Garavani's life is not a history of obsession, it's a history of intimacy with mutual reverence.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries was transformed into a glamorous runway of 60 meters long, which offers a change of roles: a visitor takes the place of models and must defile the podium by looking at "visitors" from dreams that glow with Valentino's masterpieces, such as a dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a suit that Monica Vitti used in "Nochie", or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to Empress Fara Dib.
==History==The names of these models are Sybilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Tourn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, or Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abascal and Designer, 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "you can't forget."
I remember him perfectly.
It was pants, shirt, vest, and jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Nati Abascal, one of the designers' muse.
"I prefer him to the others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he highlights our beauty," adds the former duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he's using, they have a lot of light in them and they're coming up to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion legislator Patricia dell Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she was dressed in Valentino either.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, that hour came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear it at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt full of rifts, put it in a fold, and cut it out without straps.
"It was a dream that came true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is out of time," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from a modeler with "maximum care..." because a dress is not just a dress, it's also a collection of memories accompanying him.
Fashion King
The great finale of the exhibit at Somerset House is Marie-chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the modeler calls her sewing) to make this outfit of ivory-coloured silk with pearls incrused, twelve species of different laces and a four-and-a-half-metre plume.
According to the journalist Susie Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in the late 20th century, the "return of clients from the highest world".
Overwhelmed by the "lifestyle" of the elite for many years, Valentino is now her best representative.
The Grand Cross Cavalier (the sign of the highest rank in Italy), the Labour Cavalier, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Speech, awarded by the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garawani gathered as much honor as any of his clients' spouses.
"Always my attention was drawn to his delicateness, his calmness, his timid and impeccable appearance," recalls Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was at a dinner at the Orse Museum a month ago.
He was sitting at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was perfect, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The hardest profession in the world: miners from Kawah Ijena
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano on steep rock trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living with sulphur in the volcano Kawah Ijen, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gas rising from the depths of the earth freezes when it comes to air.
He puts large pieces of sulphur, with a total weight of 70 kg, into two bamboo baskets, he puts the baskets on his shoulders, and he carries them up on a rocky road.
Up to the top of a volcano of 2,386 meters, it takes only 250 meters, but exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to climb up with a turtle’s step, struggling to maintain a balance and carefully navigating the road to avoid falling or falling off a cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the rocks of Kawah Ijen a few years ago.
Cavah Ijena miners earn 5 eurocents for each kilogram of sulphur they produce.
Upstairs, they lay the road between tourists who photograph them, as if they were circus monkeys and were tired of carrying heavy baskets, walking three kilometers to the scales that the mining company had set up a little higher, at a height of 1,850 metres.
This is the PT Candy Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has operated this volcano since 1960 and, best and not least, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) of petrochemical production, because it is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Because the norm is 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every walk," explains Anto, who usually carries three daily shifts.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end of the day feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate Rs. 138,000 (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems a miser for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
“The daily wage for miners is very high by local standards, where the collection of coffee is paid by Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2) per day and the average monthly earnings are Rs. 2 million (Euro167),” explains a porter who used to work as a rocker on the tourist island of Bali.
His salary there was Rs. 75,000 (Euro6.2) per day and the plot was not as heavy as it was, but Anto returned with his family to Banuwanga, a town near the volcano, for a compelling reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where there are Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto's got asthma, he's breathing hard, coughing all the time, and his eyes are gonna cry because of the toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah Egen, whose sulphur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are going to cry because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
It's the price that he has to pay to make his dream come true.
"I'll work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
A man punished by his life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter, or a hotel porter, but instead he does a mule's job.
A dirty wooden hut with other porters, it rises up every day at 2:00 a.m. because the sulfur never stops running out at night when its distinctive yellow color turns blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
Defending the shadows, Anto goes down into the crater, lighting his way with a small lamp connected to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry baskets of gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano.
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the production of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work at their own expense and with such hardships.
In fact, they do not even receive part of Rs. 30,000 (€2.5) of the photography fee, which, together with the entry ticket for Rs. 15,000 (€1.2), the guards of the reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mules.
“This work is for livestock, not for humans,” says Badrusin, a 42-year-old corrugated porter, who spent three decades in Kawah Egen since he left college.
He's able to raise to 110 kilograms, and he says he's going to take the job as long as he can because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
If I don't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so patient that no one complains of their severe diseases... more serious, apparently than their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, knee pains and ulcers on their shoulders, which were deformed under the weight of the basket.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only raise 50 pounds in his 53 ’ s.
Every day, he and his companions carry 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, traveling 18 kilometers along a narrow path in the trench.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth wide and missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, older than 30 years old, he also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest things in the world: what human mules do from Kawah Ijena.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and prices for housing and education for lack of children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I'm the husband of a patriot, you're my wife a patriot, we'll do our civic duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the marketing of mint cakes, but this video, or perhaps because of it, became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put the bao in the oven" to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that through advertising they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a form of entertainment.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their national duty.
It's just for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
That's the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce our own kind, so we felt that this is the subject we should address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, for example, launch spirits with pheromones or arrange quick dating parties (blitz whiskeys).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing we could do to solve this problem, which is to make a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take it so lightly are the Singapore Government.
It spends 1,300 dollars a year on politics to inspire citizens to have more children.
The government package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and provided tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its National Population Authority, is now at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 -- known as replacement percentage -- in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Marriage and Family Policy Office of the National Population Office, says that the reason for the “improved education” and “the wider range of career opportunities”.
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities other than marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriage and childbirth, which has resulted in a decline in Singapore ' s birth rate.
However, immigration policies, which were aimed at sharpening immigration in order to counter population decline, were indignant among the local population.
Singapore has web sites where there is barely hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and unwilling to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling Singaporean party had had the worst election record in the past year since independence.
After the elections, an attempt was made to solve the problem through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While fertility declines have a significant impact on the nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, medical spending and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making efforts to prevent so many small housing units from being built.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has moved on to monitoring the number of small apartments known as a shoe box that can be built in certain parts of the city.
These apartments, which are 46 square metres, are very well sold.
Nevertheless, there is a view that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yoo-sun, CEO of the EL Developers, says that their shoe boxes are sold much faster than larger copies.
They're more popular, in the sense that such apartments buy for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our revenues are increasing.
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the new regulations provided clearer guidance to developers who had been subjected to obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too tense.
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have much effect.
"People are overstretched, housing is expensive, as is education, and so many people delay it," says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man 20 years old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and prices of housing and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, the last word is for the Singaporeans.
Personal offline, personal online.
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, this is a characteristic of the private or “sphere of private life, which has the right to defend against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social media?
Does he understand the dangers faced by Internet discussions of situations that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," in a personal sense, and "password and user's name" when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets would not be uploaded to the post," says Jorge, a ten-year-old, trying to explain the meaning of personal on Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had records for two years.
"It's very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
On FB, I download beautiful pictures or games.
I also have fun with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not mine, or someone who's acting stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is not good to publish indecent photos of naked people, crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows she has a password for one of the records.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just download them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends fast," he says.
Without thinking, he says that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count on anyone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, and the latter admits that he doesn't know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, he was not trusted by anyone or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they push me or demand me, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not stranger to the experience of what is known today as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was being blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted.
"He never knew who it was," he assures us.
The victim, according to José, did not remove the record.
"Only included confidentiality."
He then explains the sequence of steps to configure the account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would download photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or conflicting situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like a man or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cybermobbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marios Porras, an English teacher and an education and training specialist, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet appeared as a means of searching for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game changed," she notes.
Porras points out that the academist Mark Prensky, a teacher at Yale University and the author of the work, Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are them, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning ourselves," she says.
Explains that the topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken, at an age when maturity is insufficient to do so”.
"So that they should be selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them reflect.
"Telling them that they should not do it is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to have a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others publish about you?
When you sign pictures of parties, do you ask permission from other people to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to act online the way they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Over the Internet, people behave with respect, responsibility and other principles, as well as social media," she claims.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a primary education professor and an education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies in good faith.
By understanding each point, they have good reason to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to spread or publish," he says.
According to Gourdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR Summit ends without the declaration of Lima
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, which was previously declared and theoretically signed by the seven mandatory participants.
Efe repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the sixth ordinary meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the President ' s Administration indicated on the front page that it would be handed over after closure, but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government ' s website at a certain time.
On questions about the text, they indicated that the contents had been provided by the President of Peru, Oljanta Umala, during the press briefs.
The access of journalists to information about the Summit was always limited.
In the course of the day, only a video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with a message "closed meeting, no sound."
A small amount of information that was circulating among reporters was transmitted by some UNASUR government spokespersons attending the meeting, but not Peruan.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which provoked discontent among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
The Government of the President of Peru subsequently sent an e-mail to the media with the summit's “final declaration”, but this is the Umala statement, not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was also not circulated, despite press insistence.
On the official ASPA website, it is possible to verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had endeavoured to ensure that broadcast systems were provided to all journalists, but had limited access to information as much as possible.
The Summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt a verdict of the Hague Court, which resolves the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Oljanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Piniera, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the ruling of the International Court of Justice, which began the hearing of statements by both parties on Monday in The Hague, in the context of the accusation that Lima had put forward against Santiago.
“We will abide by and implement a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court”, said Umala, next to her Chilean colleague.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals”, he added, and welcomed the hand of Umala against the background of the flags of the two countries.
The reaffirmation by both Presidents of their obedience to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia protested this week against the Pact of Bogotá, according to which it recognized submission to the verdicts of that international court following the decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which it considered to be wrong.
The Summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christine Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR had been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former President, Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Oljanta Umala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon in Lima time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and action lines had been approved for 31 South American projects, with an estimated investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries would take “important steps towards the purpose of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residence agreements”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of medicines, affordable Internet access in all corners of South America and to take into account the combined and effective risks of natural disasters”.
Since Europe is in crisis, “the economic unification (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to broaden our productive base and anticipate a better future for our cities,” Umala added.
“We have decided to grant privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve South America's connectivity, especially in the countryside and border zones... uniting our countries and creating new economic schemes,” the Peruvian President said in a read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were from Peru and were limited to transverse axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, while two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The outcome document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations”, from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united and to have good relations among neighbours was another theme emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before taking part in the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogotá.
"After tomorrow (saturday), perhaps meet President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
“We will review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua”, he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we can deal with this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," he added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico City on Saturday, where they will be present at the inauguration of the new President of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also at the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc met provisionally to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Guyana, Suriname, Paraguay and Uruguay constitute UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship”: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the establishment of common citizenship is the goal of “South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told Peru's public television that Europeans had “killed each other during the Second World War” and in other clashes, “but now they are almost the same country”.
It defended, in this context, the South American citizenship project, which is endorsed by the UNASUR participating countries.
“There must be free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want us back in the past,” he cautioned.
The President of Ecuador has also shown his support for the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS), with a view to reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Human Rights Pact.
The lecturers never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the other hand, sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington, D.C., financed by the United States”, he said, in hinding to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured us that he did not regret this decision because with him he did not betray his principles, but rather respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that there had been “some suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring him to come to his territory for questioning about an alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law itself considers it possible to carry it out through a videoconference that could be made available from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London”.
Correa confirmed that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
What's really there is the risk of his physical and mental health deteriorating because he's locked up in a small space without being able to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by providing a security guarantee that would allow him to go to Ecuador was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the WikiLeaks founder.
We are not negotiating human rights, which we do not use in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, because assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European jurisdictions," he mentioned.
And he thought, "If the UK gives tomorrow a guarantee of immunity, it's over."
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation allows it, and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interviews him on Skype, the problem will be over tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate “mediocy, bad faith and lies that distorted freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of press freedom are not spoiled politicians, but bad journalists who support gain, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he was pleased that neither these journalists, “no bankers nor the bourgeois hegemonic countries dominate Ecuador”, and added that, by re-elected, “will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to retain the Paraguayan veto in UNASUR until at least the next election, arguing that the organization “should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the mask of legality”, because in fact “it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy”.
Moreover, the President of Ecuador considered the desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime boundaries between the two countries, following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which had proved to be in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty, to be “perfectly justified”.
This decision is not being implemented to date.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
They must be processed together in order to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed the hope that the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile would be well concluded in the same court, and said that “it would be appropriate for Latin America to apply to international bodies if the two countries committed themselves to a decision, however difficult it may be”.
With regard to the opportunity to stand as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he was considering the possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes difficult”.
Correa assured me that if he lost in the elections in February 2013, he would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unjust situations such as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I had to accept that responsibility," he said.
If you win, it would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"This is the decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a worsening of President Chavez' health," he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today is the result of a late diagnosis.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test was positive.
"I feel like I've been deafened," he remembers, despite all the doctor's tactics, the moment.
The boy kept it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified, and he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the “oldest” patients in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) Hospital, where he was admitted in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He's been living with the diagnosis of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe that there were too few treatments then, too little knowledge of the disease, too much bias towards the sick.
So even the director of the clinic at the Mexican Social Security Institute didn't want to say good-bye to him "because he had a cut."
In other words, AIDS was a sentence at that time.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and do it without compromising the quality of life.
Yet, without knowledge of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greatest achievement to date is that the patient's survival, who begins treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same”, pointed out the head of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was confirmed in a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
Infectious and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008 scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but that the duration and quality of life depends on the degree of injury to the immune system available to patients at the start of diagnosis with a better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years with 500 CD4 reported.
Simply put, the above means that a person who is diagnosed as HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “supporting control will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age”, he explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has dropped from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the emergence of AIDS.
Only in Jalisco had 255 people died in 2011 and 187 had already been killed by May of this year; however, it has been claimed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatalities?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it. That's how things are in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we've had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He gave devastating data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore to provide samples for detection on a mass scale, for all people who ask for it."
In his proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA) agree, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory for testing only because his friend did so and, despite his young age, he was already in the AIDS phase and even suffered from the Kaposhi sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the common complications.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather get drunk three times a week," they say, "but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I'm good at eating, doing exercise, taking medication.
To date, his parents only know that he's had cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and another person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, in fear.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year.
Condoms on the counter
Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has dealt with the HIV problem, believes that there is a great gap between health programmes and ordinary citizens.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we've been given one or two before, now we've been given hundreds of bags, and that's very good, but it turns out there are those who still don't have access to the condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you want them?" that's a popular question, with ejection and condemnation, by social workers, school counsellors, pharmacists, and health workers, who don't want to hear from teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I suggest that this inefficient distribution be changed; that condoms be not just behind counters, and that hundreds of them be in machine guns in public toilets in places often visited by young people.
It's not a promotion of promiscuity.
It was not about paying for beer and motels, and Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied when asked if condom distribution was possible under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms accessible to those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
There are 13.435 registered cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is ranked four in the national ratings for new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13 in HIV.
92 per cent of the infections are sexual, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent through perinatal path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know about it.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that nullifies the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with affiliates in a neighbouring country that has problems with capacity to pay.
It seems that procedures to support the survival of firms, which are permitted by Mexican law, are not valid in the country, in contradiction with international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the 15 June decision of Judge Harlin Hale at the Bankruptcy Court of the Northern District of Texas leaves defenceless Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of seizure of their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the doors of the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the judge points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceeding concerns a competitive proceeding in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises of a transnational nature.
In fact, for that purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law had been established, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that, without an inter-firm vote, the majority required to approve restructuring would not have been achieved, recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt production that Vitro affiliates had owed to the parent company.
Nevertheless, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agramex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debts have been guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Proceedings.
It is also true that, by subtracting the votes of the branches, Vitro creditors who fought against it in the United States courts, namely vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal deletes this information.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation she has faced since 2008 as a result of the severe economic crisis that the United States has faced in attacking the country.
So far, the family firm of Gonzalez Sada will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself to reach its plenary, i.e., five judges, in view of the fact that only three have voted.
In the event of failure, an application for certification will be submitted, which will require a review of the trial by the highest court, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
Worse still, the court rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico as amicus curiae (the “friend of the court”), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, indicating that it is exempt from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it to section 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
They hit Vitro and hit the country.
Total balance
In view of the months-long delay in the complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarraga Andrade, who is charged with fraudulent management, the Trade Union Association of Aviator Pilots has already discovered a bottleneck.
Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino's office has just submitted a criminal complaint against the National Banks and Securities Commission, which is charged with obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory body systematically refused to report to the Office of the Procurator-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the trust fund of the F/589 bank of IXE, on behalf of Mexico Airlines.
Resources would be directed towards the purchase of shares of the Hotel Professional Management Company.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas network.
Rounded by Dragon Mart
Having met at a forum at the Caribbean University on the weekend, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of general civil society endorsed the establishment of a broad front to confront the opening of China’s Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We're talking, as you know, about a giant marketing and distribution centre for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, products from an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for 150 companies.
Canacintra had previously succeeded in bringing the governors of the south-east zone together to confront the monumental forces that had levelled off some protected areas and posed serious threats to the industry.
ACTA Death
With regard to the Government ' s rejection of the Senate ' s request to explain under what circumstances and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan has signed the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known as the Abbreviation in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, the case has already been archived.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of treating it as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the Long term

The NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, information technology leaders, a consortium with the trade name Competival has just emerged, and will aim at the software cluster market in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Hector "Hetin" Reyes, an aggressive basketball traveler, has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And before the brain hemorrhaging in 2008, Reyes was loaded into a wheelchair for more than 60 years, as a player in small categories, as a player in the High Basketball League, as a commissioner and leader of BSN with the Baaemon Cowboys and the President of the Basketball Federation.
"I played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including at the same time as when I was president of BSN, director-general of the National Team and president of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalls during Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate by making that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things gathered on his long journey, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotion, he retains those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid 1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years as a co-agent or contract agent.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed most because I was able to be part of eight Cowboy championships since 1967, as an agent, as a co-agent, or as a leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsey's BSN debut.
Since then, Kuko Ortiz, who was the great administrator, has continued to be the leader,” Reyes pointed out.
I remember that Gene Bartov, who was on his way here and was at Alabama University, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Do you want to?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartov then recommended a sniper, Raymond Gauss, who acquired citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincey had brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Champion with Gauss, but I was already away because by 1988 I had already been the head of the Federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and those of Mincey in the national team.
I remember the first time we won from the U.S. during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we got fourth place, and it was supposed to be bronze, if it wasn't for the Canadian judge who forced us to replay the final game, Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She was among the best, as was the one who won from Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and smashed the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Minci, Gaussa, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and Piculina (Ortisa) play the team again, but also the young (Havier) Toñito Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Kichote" Morales, who were unable to participate in 1990 because of a knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but which brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifications tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hurrouitner to replace the players suspended for messing up in the Panamanian Mar del Plata Championship, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't include his careers in the various leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your biggest achievement in the Federation?
Attended in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to do, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce play only in their own area and only against teams from other parts of the island to national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's unnecessary.
At least I see the benefits of mandatory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes go to basketball games.
And, of course, I'm enjoying the company of my wife, Isabel, who's always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world-famous because of his main role as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in a television series called "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as J.R. Ewing's oil magnate in the "Dallas" TV series became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new "Dallas" season, died on Friday evening due to complications caused by cancer, according to the family's statement to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a studio produced by "Dallas".
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the most important role he liked," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him at the Thanksgiving fair in Dallas.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at the hospital in Dallas, told her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, sweet and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," affirmed Gray in the statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and was transplanted.
Long before the Dallas, Hagman gained prominence on television by playing a decent role in the easy comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets the attractive Jeanne girl that Barbara Eden plays, and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the movies included the roles well received by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his workshop to interpret the deliciously disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of fame.
The CBS drama series about the Yuings and other characters around it aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The ad-hoc slogan "Who shot J.R.?" designed to create a fuss around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character was almost killed, generated international debate and millions of dollars at risk in bookies.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the show at that time.
When the November 1980 episode was answered, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned "Dellas" into the second most entertaining program in history, after the 1983 MASH final, which attracted 50 million viewers.
She was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine, who shot him.
J.R. interrupted her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his spouse, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be treated.
"I know what's supposed to be on J.R." Hegman said in 1988.
It must be said, "This is where the honest citizen J.R. Ewing rests."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principal, also the character of the original show, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone "growing, both on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and indispensable to millions of worshipers around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have had the privilege of knowing and loving it.
Ten episodes of the new issue of "Dallas" were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
Five episodes of the second season were completed and six were in production, according to the channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet announced what will happen to the show after Hagman left.
Born of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who was glowing in classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to Ben Hagman.
He tried to be happy in the theater scenes of New York City in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force of England from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, Mai Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I thought was capable of hurting anyone or influencing them in any way," he said Prenza Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he promoted organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients with fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go into surgery, and after," he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course is beginning that explores the End of the World.
Every week students study apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when Professor of Religion Stuart Sharma decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible bait: the end of the Maya calendar, on 21 December, for which many people had taken hold as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was coming in the next few months: the catastrophic storm Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the long-armageddon, and the growing conflict that Israel is taking in, a place where Christian end-of-time theorists believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharma this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey.
If you look at what is happening in the world today, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember, bad things are good for those with apocalyptic thinking.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the end of the world this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Associate Professor Barry Walker holds a course on media, culture and the end of the world.
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're analysing why these ideas spread over time," he said, "and the way they're offered hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war can break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they related to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students what might be plausible and impossible," said Walker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor Matthew Restall of Latin America and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art and anthropology, merged to read a course called the End of the World.
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the “imminent destruction”, students must study, prepare projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be accepted on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work “until the very night the world is supposed to end”, said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"The place ended in two hours," said Restal about his high-medium course for students, for which 35 students were enrolled.
We received e-mail messages for weeks before the semester began from people who asked if there were any more spaces.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the department of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers Camden.
And apocalyptic thinking, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Vequez, a 25-year-old student in psychology and sisterhood, said he was watching all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a course to teach it," he observed.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed -- let alone the professor -- said he believed in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project touched upon the Maya prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last year at Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; this is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which lasts for centuries, where people react to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in an English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on the end of the world there.
"The Philippines does not take part at the end of the world," he wrote, implying a superior order.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that for a long time there had been many days of last trial, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people would immediately start thinking about the next date” or philosophizing that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are careless about this date.
Some say they're going to end-of-the-world parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old telecommunications student.
