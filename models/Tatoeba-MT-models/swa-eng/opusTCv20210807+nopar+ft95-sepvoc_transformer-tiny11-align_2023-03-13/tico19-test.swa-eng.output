The rapid rise in the cases of koronavirus (COVID-19) in the European/Eneo Economic Union of Europe and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The total events of the koronavirus cases (COVID-19) show the suffrage in the European Union/Eneo Economic states of Europe and the United Kingdom to prove that, at a different level based on the country involved, COVID-19 is continuing to grow rapidly in all countries.
According to the situation in Italy, nations, hospitals and critical care units should increase their condition of being prepared for the increase in COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and especially critical conditions.
On 31 December 2019, a group of cases that their sources are unknown were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the cause of illness as a new korona virus that is currently known as severe asthma problems that are sever accute respiry syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Thus, SARS-CoV-2 disease has been named a koronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence that is so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have an average condition of illness, namely asthma or without pneumonia and many of them recovered.
In 14% of the cases, COVID-19 grows with the worst condition that requires a person to be admitted to the hospital while 6% of the remaining cases are of critical condition that requires critical treatment.
The death rate of patients admitted from COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we review the total events of COVID-19 in every European Union/Eneo Economic Union (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare the situation in Hubei County, China.
We also compared the number of current COVID-19 cases in EU/EEEA and the UK UK to the number in Italy from 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and England
After China, COVID-19 spread to geographic areas and issues of COVID-19 disaster in other parts of the world are currently following those of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a major disaster.
In the March 5th edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Jupiter et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 according to the definition of the case according to WHO.
In the EU/EEA, the first three Vvisa confirmed were reported by France on 24 January 2020 among the returning people from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
By 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been discovered in all 30 EU/EEEA and British nations (UK), where between 31 December 2019 as well as that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths as only Italy.
Finding a total number and total of COVID-19 cases
At the European Center for Prevention and Control (ECDC), a known number of COVID-19 cases in every country worldwide, found from any official sources such as WHO, is scoring daily at 8:00 a.m.
These documents were used for reviewing current COVID-19 issues in EU/EEEA and UK, compared to Italians.
As part of the existing COVID-19 cases, we calculated the total number of COVID-19 events in 14 days reduced, thus considering the original source of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and England, in 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the total number of reported cases of each country by 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to the Italian country for a period starting on 31 January–15 March 2020.
Current issues on COVID-19 in EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom
Current issues in COVID-19 cases in 14 days reduced in EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom generally followed those of Hubei County (China) (Photo 1).
For EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom in general, the total number of COVID-19 events began to rise on 21 February and increased on 28 February 2020 (the extra text).
This was further operated by the increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but throughout EU/EEA and the United Kingdom countries showed the counter-profile issues of the overall COVID-19 events (the extra text).
The 2nd photo shows the total number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom compared to that of Italy for 31 January-15 March 2020.
It shines that, by 15 March 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA and the United Kingdom already reported a total number of cases that can be compared to that of Italy in the original 3 weeks or less.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 reported cases is increasing significantly in the EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom.
The issues viewed in the total COVID-19 events suggested that this major disaster is increasing at a relatively fast rate in all countries.
This is despite different countries being in different levels, different in how every public health faces the possibility of different definitions of cases in countries and different options to choose patients who must be read for COVID-19 confirmation, including the testing of people.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed a deep treatment and information sources reported that hospitals and critical care units were already full of pneumonia.
Data about the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospital or critical care unit is currently available EU/EEEA level for 6% and 1% of the cases of monk (data has not been shown).
However, they should be collected in a special order to be used along with current research data that highlights the number of cases reported by the death toll.
Research conducted 2010-11 showed a significant difference in access to critical and moderate medical beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries can have fewer or more resources than Italy (the feeding networks in critical condition and average treatment of 12.5 per 100,000 in 2010–11).
The conditions related to the extent of the ability to handle treatment, with estimates of every country in the EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom of the population with COVID-19 admitted to hospital risk of › 90% of passing the ability of beds available to care for people in critical condition, is given in the sixth review of the rapid risk of COVID-19.
Since cases are currently included in certain areas in EU/EEEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and facilities for handling people in critical condition typically service in special numbers, information about cases and beds of admissions of people in critical condition should be found in the title units for the 2nd (NUTS-2).
The situation in Italy and current issues in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The country, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the continued condition of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in COVID-19 patients who need treatment and especially the treatment of people in critical condition, such as taking place in the affected areas of Italy.
As suggested in a recent assessment of the risk of ECDC, a rapid trend, involving people and todoti is important in delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2, with changes from the control perspective to counter, as the expected increase of the number of cases may not give decisions and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and set their strategies to cope accordingly if they do not act accordingly.
A review of rapid risk also lists public health measures to deal with the impact of a major disaster.
There is a small space for opportunity where countries have the ability to increase their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on treatment.
Failure to do so, there is a potential for other EU/EEEA health systems to face the increase in patients who need a deep treatment within the future or weeks.
The outbreak of the korona 2019virus (COVID-19), caused by severe asthma problems that are severe acece respirary syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thus killing over 3,000 people and infected them over 80,000 people in China and the world's kungineko, causing human disaster.
Like the similar viruses, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS among the population's bodies in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be distributed from bats and caused the same symptoms through the same way.
However, COVID-19 has a lower level of severity and death rates than SARS but the greater ability to be transmitted and infecting older people than young people and more than women.
In dealing with the growing number of publications on this emerging disease, this article is trying to provide a time-time inspection and a review of this fast-being subject of research.
We will address the basic issues about epidemiology, biology, studies, treatment, its sources and prevention.
Although there are still other questions that need to be answered, we hope that this inspection will help in understanding and eliminate this threatening illness.
Spring Festival Festival on 25 January 2020 has been an unexpected memory for all Chinese people who were urged to stay home in the entire holiday period and for weeks later due to a re-existing of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the korona (CoV) virus that caused the outbreak of severe asthma problems that are sever accute respirary syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, the World Health Organization named SARS-CoV-2 on 11, February 2020 and related illness was named after CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
This massive tragedy began at Wuhani, China and spread rapidly across the country and about 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2020, these viruses have caused 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with over 40,000 patients being allowed to return home and over 3,000 farewell to the world.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "an enemy number 1 of the public" and is likely to be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published about COVID-19 including biobiology, epidemiology, biology, biology, research and treatment since the first report on 7 January, 2020 which noted a series of viral separation from many patients.
This survey is trying to summarize the development of research in a new fast-growing topic.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, Middle East respirary syndrome (MERS, and the rebound in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and the cause of illness as well as some of the questions that have not yet been answered.
CoV Japanese virus has been considered a non-human virus, which mainly causes about 15% of the normal flu 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered the most widely distributed human CoVs and viruses, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused a re-existing in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, monk, and soon spread rapidly in many other nations with high quality of illness and death rates.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV in the recorded human history.
As shown in the 1,1 photo, the pneumonia conventions whose origin was not known was first reported from Wuhani on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission in China.
Seven days later, the CoV pick was launched.
On 15 January 2020, the first worst episode from Wuhani was reported.
Currently, this disaster spread rapidly in towns, provinces and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, the release among medical service providers was reported, and indicate that human infection to humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city's regular operations were closed and public transport was discontinued.
On 24 January, the first medical research on this disease was reported, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, 21 alone had directly touched each other with Wuhan's marine food market that was considered that the area where the infection began from the source of an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced this rebound as a global health emergency.
By the time of the publication of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world (Photo.2).
As the situation continues to grow, the final climax and the effect of this rebound has not yet been identified.
Mano on 11 February 2020, a study of 8,866 patients' stations including 4,021 which were confirmed to have COVID-19 presented a more controversial image than this tragedy as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 virus affected people of all ages, but most of the 30–65 years.
About half (47.7%) of infected people had over 50 years old, a few were under 20 years and only 14 people were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 affected more men (0.31/1000,000 than (0.27/1000,000).
COVID-19 expanded in groups especially in and near Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average number of 5 days (2–9) from the beginning of the investigation.
The average period of his execution was 4.8 days (3.0–7.2).
The average period from him to death was 9.5 days (4.8–13).
The number of generation (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.005), and R0 changed was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the public travel time before the Spring Festival in China.
The death rate of patients confirmed to have cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%), and the modified rate of deaths of patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk-seasons of COVID-19 were sex (mme), age (=60), and the bad condition of pneumonia.
CoV is a small family of large and combined viruses with one RNA pick.
They can be divided into four types, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, where alpha-and CoV betas are known to infect humans.
The glycoprotini (S) closes its angiotensini cells changing enzaim 2 (ACE2) and dipeptdyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, you will then get the membrane combination.
The RNA of the virus is released on the sapoplasim; after the production of a virus genome, the genome RNA with glaikoprotoni linked to nucleacapsids to create a mengenge with virion, which is then connected to plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 line was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with over 99.98% of the kinic identity among 10 subsequent samples collected from the natural area of this leak, Huanan Seafood market of Wuhani.
SARS-CoV-2 virus is more similar to SARS-CoV kinetic than MERS-CoV.
Through electronic distribution, SARS-CoV-2 pieces were found in the most narrowest parts of the human air route.
Human ACE2 was found to be SARS-CoV-2's review similar to SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein connects to the human ACE2 in a weaker way than SARS-CoV, which is accompanied by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 virus argues the worst condition of patients compared to SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also create a new protein with a code orf3b and a protein produced with a code orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b-CoV-2 can take place in the condition of the virus causing the gojwa and prevent the appearance of IFNć; however, orf8 has no known team that works.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou and his colleagues, reported the cruo-EM structure of the full length of the human ACE2 as a 2.9 › for integration and amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the integration, which had clear sides and ties to the line, was collected as two molecules and the combination of ACE2-B0AT1 can connect two S proteins, which gives evidence of the recognition and introduction of CoV.
B0AT1 may be a medical target for a study of SARS-CoV-2.
Chipox and central virus carrier
It has been known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have roots from bats and were distributed to humans through cats ngawa and camels, monk.
Through the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV, bats were considered to be SARS-CoV-2 carriers as the virus is similar to 96% and CoV similar to SARS from bats called bat-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, the middle carrier who helped this virus move to humans from such an animal barrier is still unknown and the method of its distribution has not yet been decorated.
Ji and his colleagues, recommended snakes to be viral carriers from bats to humans that involved re-convention within S protein.
According to some research, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that a long-season brother, ants who eat ants who have been used as a Chinese medicine - are more likely to carry SARS-CoV-2 virus according to 99% of the kinic homoji in CoV discovered within the brother and SARS-CoV-2.
However the difference of 1% of the two genomes is still a major difference; so, perfect results for solid evidence are still waiting (Photo 33).
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can grow within 48 hours of measurement in a dry environment and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%–50% of the humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have the same reputation.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is affected by the rays of traviolet and the 56 °C temperature for 30 minutes; ether, 75% of ethanol, a cleaner containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other oil solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively maim this virus.
All humans generally have no body protection against SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore at risk of getting these new viruses.
Currently, no detailed research has reported regarding body defense confrontations against SARS-CoV-2.
So we can only refer to the original studies about other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Photo.4).
In general, after the virus invades the carrier, they are first recognized by the non-living body immune system of carrying them through the receivers of the model (PR) including the C-type reviews of the eccle, Toll (TLR), the NOD (NLR), and the RIG-I (RLR).
Through different ways, viruses cause the existence of elements that cause tissue burns, the development of dedraiti cells and the production of the I interferons (IFNs) which controls the spread of viruses and accelerates the production of anti-virus proteins.
However, the SARS-CoV protein can help the virus avoid the edge of the body's immunity.
In a short time, the body’s immunity joins in fighting viruses.
White blood cells of T including CD4+ and CD8+ cell T may have an important role in the protection of the body.
T's CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodis facing specific viruses and the T cell of CD8+ is directly affected by viruses.
T helper cells produce saitokini molecules that help burn conditions to help protect the cell.
However, CoV is able to prevent the performance of T cells by causing the execution of T cells.
Defense in the human body including guerrillas such as C3a and C5a and various antibodis are also important in coping with viral transmission.
For example, antibodis released to a recovered patient destroyed MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, when the body’s immunity produces excessive antibodi can cause severe lung damage and other organs, and in worse conditions, many organs are unemployed and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, originally reflected are more likely to affect older people with other diseases and pregnant women.
It is common that for people who are in danger of getting a large number of viruses or whose antibodies are weak, they have a greater chance to be infected with others.
The estimated average period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1–14 days, often 3–7 days according to a study of the first 425 cases at Wuhani.
However, a study on 1,099 cases shows that his period was 3 days on average and was between 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study as described above shows that the period of exposure was 4.8 days (3.0–7.2) according to the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is important for the health authorities to adjust the time of the karantin in accordance with the same period of exposure, thus preventing infected people who do not show signs to spread viruses to others.
As a common act, people at risk or infected with viruses are usually required to be in the katanti for 14 days.
Should the katanti time be added to 24 days?
The body’s heat is the main symptom and often the original COVID-19, which can be followed by the absence of symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, difficulty in breathing, muscle pain, knife pain, headaches, headaches, flu, chest pain, driving, fermentation and vomiting.
Some patients had difficulty breathing and/or low level of fresh air at the beginning of the disease.
In worse cases, patients continued to have serious respiratory problems, a condition that causes the body’s organs not to function, too much acid in the body and the blood condition of the body’s inability to freeze.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of asthma and severe fever, even without respiratory problems should be tested by viruses in early studies.
A biographic study in late December 2019 showed the percentage of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for the difficulty of breathing and 3% for driving; 8% of patients who needed the help of respiratory machines.
Similar results were reported in two recent family sample studies and samples that caused by a person who did not show symptoms of illness.
Comparatively, study of biographics in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and difficulty breathing (5%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed breathing machines, than COVID-19 patients and this is married to MERS' severity than COVID-19.
Driving (26%) and the throat to bite (21%) also appeared among MERS patients.
For SARS patients, it has been revealed that high body temperature (99%-100%), dry cough (29%–7%), difficulty breathing (40%-42%), driving (20-25%) and the throat to bite (13–25%%) were the main symptoms and breathing machines were required for 14%–20% of patients.
By 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Compared, the death rates from SARS by November 2002 were 10% of the confirmed 8,096 cases.
For MERS, according to biographic research in June 2012, death rates were 37% of the confirmed 2,494 confirmed cases.
The original study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high at 6.47 at 95% standard (CI) of 5.71–7.23, where the SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4 degrees.
SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in connection with their symptoms, death rates and R0 are shown at the 1.1th Jedwali.
The above statistics show that SARS-CoV-2 have the highest-level scoring MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV but its edge is lower than two other hivos.
So there is a major challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 disaster than to control MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
When it emerges at the beginning, it is often done in the same family or from the same convention or car as a ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or live in Wuhani or other affected areas or contact with people or patients affected in the past two weeks before starting.
However, it has been reported that people can carry this virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who have been allowed to return home can carry this virus again, which provides caution for the addition of the katanti.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white side blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the original phase.
For example, the condition of the shortage of white blood cells › 4&109/L including the number of lymphocyte › 1&109/L and the modified levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were available to 1,099 patients of COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle and myoglobin increased in the blood of some patients and C-reactive protein and the cleaning of erythrocyte increased in the blood of many patients.
For patients with severe cases, the D-dimer level, the lower quality of the fibroni in the blood, it was raised and the number of lymphocyte continued to decline.
The unusual conditions in chest measurements were available to many COVID-19 patients and the conditions included two-way shadows or lung closing that they could not be seen.
Patients often had unusual pneumonia, serious lung injuries and serious respiratory problems that are accute respirary distress syndrome (ARDS).
If it happens to ARDS, uncontrolled burning, liquid gathering and continuing vascular weaving is serious conflict with gas-reference.
The lack of work for type-I air-I and type-II reduces the shock rates of liquid products and increases the levels of regional shock, thus reducing the risk of lungs to expand and put more risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the results of the most severe chest measurements are parallel to the worst rate of illness.
On February 18, 2020, the first analysis of COVID-19 was marked by the internal parts of the lungs, the structure of the hyaline, the entry of lymphocytes in the body through multi-speed trails and cells in the lungs of the mgjwa who died from this disease, in comparison with the pathology of the virus and ARDS and the same as SARS and MERS patients.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the re-transcriptase polymerase (RT-PCR) was used as a primary process of COVID-19 testing.
However, due to the high rate of cases of disease not available through measurement, which can spread this tragedy, medical signals began to be used for testing (which no longer depends on RT-PCR only) in China on 13 February 2020.
Similar conditions also occurred through SARS testing.
Therefore, the total history of illness, medical manifestations, experiments on romance and radio effects are essential and suitable for making effective measurements.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang described the process of using the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR to discover SARS-CoV-2, which discovers SARS-CoV-2 RNA pieces in 20 › 10–18 mel/L to 200 › 10–18 mol/L (c. 10–100 per small litre) with a metal drop for less than an hour without needing a unit.
We hope that this new technique can improve in a unique and easy way if it is confirmed in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of new CoV experience, medical professionals can provide assistance treatment for COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of treatments that have previously been used or proposed to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other types of viral diseases ( Jeddi ( Jeddi (Mad.2).
These treatments include modern and possible treatment and drugs are fighting viruses, immune units, steroids, plasma from patients who are present, pharmaceutical and psychological aid from China.
Even plasma from recovered patients was recommended for treatment.
Drug products companies are struggling to create antibodi and vaccines against these viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks other organs that show ACE2 despite low levels, such as the intestinal system of gas and kidney.
Despite this, the lack of asthma and failure is the main threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory aid is important to relieve pain and saves lives and includes a common treatment of fresh air, fresh air flow, help to breathe without using a side machine and helped to breathe with a side machine based on the condition of the disease.
Patients with a severe asthma condition must be helped through extracorporeal membrane oxgenation (ECMO), and the cardiopmonary method bypass used in heart failure or asthma that is dangerous.
Also, maintaining the level of electrolyte, preventing and treating the second infection and not working on body organs and the protection of key organs is also important to SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is also known that the saitokini explosion comes from the immune system of patients to give an antibodi too much to fight SARS and MERS.
The saitokini explosion is a form of a burning system that involves the release of the saitokini picks including TNFō, IL-1ō, IL-2, IFNō, IFNō, IFNō, IFNć and MCP-1.
These Cytokines incorporate immune cells to release a large number of independent fields that are the main source of ARDS and the dead organs often.
The suppression of the body's immunity is essential in the treatment of the saitokini eruption, especially for patients in poor condition.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, antibodi fighting the IL6 of one oak, have been used to treat the saitokini explosion.
Other treatment for the saitokini explosion includes the control of the body's immunity directed by the T cell; IFN-ō, IL-1, and TNF; the prevention of JAK; blinatumomab; cytokinine signaling 4; and HDAC restrictions.
Steroids, as protective agents, served a major role in SARS treatment to reduce the effect of burning damage.
However, the top steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury to SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause adverse effects, especially anemia in the bones affected the greater diagnosis of disease.
Despite this, small corticosteroids of low-season dorsals have been proposed to be used properly to treat patients in COVID-19.
By the time of writing an article, there is no effective treatment against the virus that has been confirmed.
However, the injection of remdesivir injected into the veins, a nucleotide containing sugar and fosfeti, has been found to be a fafu for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new anti-virus drug created by Gilead originally for Ebola-related treatment and Marlburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also showed preventing the possibility of other RNA viruses of one type including MERS and SARS virus.
On these grounds, Gilead has released the drug to China to conduct a pair of experiments for people infected SARS-CoV-2 and events are widely expected.
Moreover, baricitinb, interferon-ō, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interestvirin have been proposed as possible treatments for patients with symptoms of serious respiratory problems.
Driving, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other bad conditions may occur following the total treatment and lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments and other drugs used for patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from patients who recovered from antibodi production
Blood collecting from patients who recovered from infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from similar illness or protecting health workers from illness has a long history.
Indeed, the patients who recovered often have high levels of antibodi compared to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodi is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight germs and other foreign objects and recognize special molecules on germs and fight them directly.
Due to this, plasma collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 was used to stab 10 patients in severe condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, including the decline in burns and viral levels and improved emissions of fresh air in the blood.
However, confirmation and definition are necessary to recommend a method of use of large standards before specific treatments are created.
Also, if medical effects are reflected, some deficiency related to plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodi can stimulate the body's immunity to pass revenge and cause a saitokini to be produced, which is likely to have a waste of life threatening.
The antibodi in the blood is low and the plasma need is high to treat patients.
It is difficult to create and produce specific antibodis more quickly to fight the global disaster.
It is thus more important to release B cells from patients who have recovered and identify the antibodi's antibodi fafu or to investigate the search for antibodi fafu against important viral protein.
In this way, we can raise the production of antibodi.
TCM has also been used to treat the type of disease in China for many years.
However, its effects are largely based on the inclusion of many units on a different form based on the diagnosis of the disease according to TCM theories.
Many fafus are still unknown or unclear as it is difficult to cool and confirm such ingredients or their best inclusion.
Currently, due to poor and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has been one of the main alternative treatments for patients with low to average symptoms or for those who have recovered from the worst stage.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing were found to treat COVID-19 effectively.
High medical standards in COVID-19 patients were seen in many provinces in China used TCM to treat 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), With Hubei province, where TCM was used for about 30% of their COVID-19 patients, had a lower level of treatment for (13%).
However, this is a superficial comparison because other patterns of effects such as the number and condition of patients should be included in review.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and co-founders published a study of comparison of western medicine (WM) only and a total of WM and TCM treatment.
They found that the time needed by restoring the body's temperature, the loss of symptoms and hospital admission decreased significantly in the WM+TCM group than the only WM group.
The best result is that the standards of patients with symptoms are worse (from a weak to worse condition) declined to the WM+TCM group than to the WM alone (7.4% against 46.2%) and death rates declined in the WM+TCM group than the only WM (8.8% against 39%).
Despite this, TCM's efficiency and security are still waiting for better controlled experiments in large levels and in more stations.
It will be interesting to give credit to the processes of action and to expose the fast-season of the TCM treatment or their inclusion if possible.
The suspected or confirmed patients have COVID-19 often undergo a state of fear of this highly contagious disease and even killing people, and people in the katanti are also going through fatigue, loneliness and anger.
Despite this, symptoms of infection such as high temperatures, lack of adequate air in body organs and cough as well as poor medical effects such as sleep shortages caused by reduced body burns can cause anxiety and stress.
In the original phase of SARS, various mental problems involving extreme stress, anxiety, attacks of fear, mental excitement, symptoms of mental disorders, mental harassment and even wanting to give life were reported.
Tracking people who are in contact with compulsory katin, as part of public health response to COVID-19, can further worry people with antibodies about the effects of infection, karatini and stigma about family and friends.
Thus, mental health therapy should be given to COVID-19 patients, people suspected by people who have contact with them and the general public they need.
The psychological support should be included in the creation of various mental health teams, open communication and frequent information that are correct about SARS-CoV-2 and medical programs and the use of professional electronic devices and programs to avoid contact with others.
The vaccine is essential to interrupt the distribution process from animals and humans infected with endangered people and are used as well as treatment against viruses in controlling the major disasters caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been set to create S protein vaccines to produce solid and long-term antibodi and/or protection protection protection against SARS-CoV.
Anti-specific vaccines have been confirmed in animal structures for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these vaccines for older people and their standards to kill viruses and anti-virus protection is still defined before medical research was established.
This is probably because SARS died 17 years ago and no new release has been reported since then.
In comparison, cases and convention here and the MERS are being held in the Middle East and spread in other areas due to animal sources in areas witnessing the spread of disease.
The vaccines are designed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA platinum, viral currents, small particles, particles similar to viruses and small protein units that are re-connected and others have been considered in animal structures.
The production of safe vaccines and fading against SARS-CoV-2 for people without body protection is an emergency and important responsibility to control this ongoing disaster.
However, there is a challenge to get rid of this challenge due to the long time needed (on average 18 months) to create vaccines and changing CoV.
As a new illness, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest themselves perfectly to the treatment of thousands of patients.
In many cases, patients can recover slowly without circumstances are caused by the previous illness.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a high level of illness and death rates for patients with poor condition.
Therefore, developing a structure based on medical experience for illness is important for health medical organizations to give priority to their services, especially in areas without adequate resources.
According to medical research reported so far, these patterns can affect or be associated with the condition of COVID-19 to patients (The 33rd Edition):
Age: Age was an important model in studying SARS, which is also a fact in COVID-19.
COVID-19 basically happened to people aged 30–65 with 47.7% of the patients with over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who needed a deep treatment were more likely to have another condition of illness and problems and were older than those who did not have (in the average age of 66 against 51) and indicate age as a pattern of COVID-19 patients' results.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has affected more men than women (0.31/100,000 against 0.27/1000,000), as described above.
Early health diseases and health conditions: Patients with COVID-19 who needed treatment are likely to be infected with a serious heart and heart failure.
Heart events were also the main cause of deaths for SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also connect to the cells of the ACE2-posive bag, which can cause non-work for COVID-19 patients' liver.
It is important to mention that age and chronic diseases have serious relationships and can interact with each other.
The unusual results of romance. The C-reactive protein level (CRP) within the blood reflects the condition of burning or tissue injury and has been proposed as a pattern of recovery, the condition of receiving medicine and healing eventually.
The relationship between CRP levels and weight and recovery from COVID-19 has also been proposed.
Also, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine deep (CK) can also help predict the results.
These Enzaims are widely manifest within many body organs, especially within the heart and the liver and are given during tissue damage.
Thus, it is the traditional signs of not working on heart or liver.
The main medical symptoms: chest testing and temporary development of medical symptoms should be considered as well as other issues for the forecast of the results and problems of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: described above, steroids are protective units that serve extensively as additional treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the rate of burning damage.
As high-profile dorsals that reduce the burning of organs were widely used for SARS patients, many victims suffered from anemia in bones and long - term disabilities and poor living conditions.
Thus, if necessary, steroids should be used for low-team and briefly for COVID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: If it was described above, during COVID-19 most patients suffered from unusual stress as they endured long katanti periods and enthusiasm and saw the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
It is important to offer psychological advice and long - term assistance to help patients recover from stress and refer to the normal life situation.
According to the demography research so far, COVID-19 appears to have biobiological components different from SARS.
Despite being produced in a low-speed method of breathing, SARS-CoV-2 can be produced in the upper part of the method of breathing effectively and causing moderate symptoms or not showing any symptoms in the original phase of the infection, similar to other CoV virus that causes severe fever.
Therefore, patients infected in the early phase or the period of exposure can produce a large amount of viruses during daily activities, causing great difficulty in the control of the disaster.
However, SARS-CoV distribution was considered to be done when patients are very ill, although much distribution was not held in the early phase.
Thus, the current COVID-19 rebound is worse and it is harder to control than SARS's rebound.
The major efforts are currently continuing in China including the closure of regular operations in Wuhan and nearby towns and developing katanti to almost all people in hopes of interrupting SARS-CoV-2 distribution.
Although these measures have been damaging the economy in a bad way and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing and signs the decline of this tragedy.
The most promising estimates are that this rebound will end by March and the phase of its impact to him will last 3–4 months.
However, some experts are less optimistic.
Paul Hunter and his colleagues, estimated that COVID-19, which is primarily seen more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and his colleagues, created a process of predicting the outcome of this disaster and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 virus may infect two thirds of the world.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in air currents and throat measurements of patients who recovered and from the hospital 2 weeks earlier, which suggests that new identified viruses may be of repeated periods such as influenza.
However, the signs of hope have occurred in China based on the decline of the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may have been working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to one million cases and deaths of half a million people.
However, through a strong katanti principle and separation, the disease is eventually controlled.
It is possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be weak in the process and eventually die or have a low rate of infectious viruses and whether it is available among humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 and SARS and MERS is presented below (Photo.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is more distributed through a cough or sneezing and can also be distributed through direct contact with the virus - contaminated equipment.
These viruses were also found in feces that trigger a new possibility of distribution from feces to mouth.
Recent research for 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were caused by hospital infection, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 medical providers.
Therefore, a serious caution should be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, community workers, family members, co-founders and even other people who touch patients or infected people.
The first defensive action that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through wearing facial blessings; using the treatment and the N95 anti-specifics (a # 1860) edition helps control the spread of the virus.
Medical surfaces prevent liquid drops from a person who can be infected against air transport or stuck in parts of the product, where they can pass to other people.
However, the only N95 (a # 1860) edition can protect against breathing in small germs even by 10 to 80 nm, with 5% of the germs being fully absorbed; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and is about 85 nm.
Since small pieces can infiltrate even five set together, healthcare providers who contact patients must wear N95 (a # 1860) edition but not medical land.
Along with the mainland, healthcare providers should wear a barn with components needed to sell more contact with viruses.
Viruses can also affect people through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he wore the N95 continent; the virus may have entered his body through his eyes that were lighting him.
Thus, health care providers should also wear visual protections or glasses while dealing with patients.
In total public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with more cleaning soap than usual, try to stay at home with private katanti and reduce contact with people who may be infected.
Three are considered to be the right distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are appropriate ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 virus came as a new virus for the human world, it is very similar to SARS-CoV as it was surpassed on 7 January 2020 would have to give a major caution to China due to their 2003 SARS's review.
However, it was until 19 January 2020 where Wuhan's director of the Center for Disease Control, comforted the public by saying that these new viruses have low levels of transmission and low-profile ability to breed from person to another and that it is not a problem to prevent and control this disease.
This message reduced public concerns, especially when the whole country was preparing for Spring Festival, and failed to deal with the disease when it was not more widespread Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can regret this and make important improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should be (1) more careful when they make public advertising because each word has meaning for the citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) to be more careful and take less common information from the clinic than wait to receive a formal report from doctors or officers; (3) to put further restrictions to control the possibility of a disaster in its original phase than trying to comfort the public and (4) mra occasionally provide further tests to increase public awareness of disaster diseases and try to improve the social response system after a time.
COVID-19 blast caused by new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, illness has spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world by this time when we write.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also the same between COVID-19 and SARS, COVID-19's rebound has caused the concept of the re-existing SARS.
However, there are some fundamental differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in controlling this tragedy and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and men more than women and their weight and death rates are higher among older people than young people.
SARS causes higher deaths than COVID-19 (10.91% against 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients are distributing viruses even when they show no symptoms while SARS patients are doing so in a very bad condition, causing more difficulty in controlling COVID-19's spread than SARS.
This explains on the side why SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly and in a wider area than SARS-CoV.
The regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA test can occur negatively for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients treated can be found with this virus again.
These results increase the risk of viral spread.
Due to the rapid continuation of research on COVID-19, many important issues have not yet been solved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 virus come from?
Although 96%'s similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-based CoVs from bats, we can still not conclude that SARS-CoV-2 are derived from bats.
Which animal was the middle to carry and distribute viruses from the natural virus carrier, for example from bats to humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2, we can't interrupt the distribution effectively and this rebound can occur again at any time.
Although the molecular structures and biochemical experiments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 you don't have to be ACE2, are the most common of these viruses enter the respiratory cells and cause the following technological changes?
Do these viruses also connect cells featuring ACE2- in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot reach a quick and accurate test and treatment.
How long will this tragedy last?
How does this virus grow in the time of human distribution?
Will you be a global disaster, you will die like SARS or happen again after a while like a flu?
It is important but you can take time to find answers to the questions above and many other questions.
However, despite its cost, we have to stop this tragedy as soon as possible and restore life to normal.
The nature of human koronavirus diseases
Physical changes and environmental conditions have contributed to the growth of the korona virus (CoVs) and its carriers, including humans for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two CoVs (CoVs) human viruses were known to cause severe illness, such as normal fever.
The frequency of severe respiratory syndrom (SARS) and the Middle East's respiratory syndrom (MERS) has changed things and demonstrated how HCoV's transmission can be dangerous and threatening life.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has made the CoVs virus again and surprised us by its high potential for spread but reduced the condition of causing disease compared to SARS-CoV virus.
HCoV infections are derived from animals and understand the nature of HCoV from animals can help us.
Most HCoV viruses came from bats where they were unable to cause disease.
The central carriers of some HCoV are also known.
Recognizing the carrier is directly involved in preventing human diseases.
A study of the CoV carrier's intervention to animals can also be very helpful to gain important recognition of the CoV's ability to cause disease among humans.
In this inspection, we submit a summary of the existing knowledge about seven types of HCoV, by reflecting the history of its discovery with its source on animals and its spread from one species of animal to another.
Very important, we compare and distinguish the different types of HCoV from the view of viral conversion and re-influence of the tooth.
The current disease of the CoV 2019 (COVID-19) has been discussed in this context.
Also, the demand for success of the carrier's change and the impact of viral growth has also been reflected.
The koronavirus (CoV) is derived from the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of combined viruses, with a positive sense and one-speed RNA.
These viruses with the largest tooth of 26 to 32 pounds of RNA virus were called "CoVs" from their shape as a crown under electronic investigation.
The code, the CoV virus has genomes that do not have the same-organized pieces.
About two thirds of the tooth have two large open frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), changing into a p1a protein andpp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Poliprotini is cut further to produce 16 non-specific proteins, which were lost as nsp1~16.
The rest of the tooth has ORF of the model protein, including spike (S), envelope (E), membreni (M) and nukleoprotini (N).
A number of specific generation proteins have been sung by different generations of CoV.
According to differences in protein picks, CoV vinmevirus is classified in four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), between them, beta-CoV genera has more HCoV virus and has divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
The literary evidence has shown that bats and weedans serve as sources of alpha-CoV gene and multiple beta-CoV, with birds being the main conservationists of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, the CoV virus has continued beyond animal barriers and others have emerged as the main causes of human gonjw.
To this day, there are seven types of CoV (CoV) of human being known.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other types of beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, koronavirus (SARS-CoV) of a high risk of breathing, the koronavirus of the Middle East (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 often cause moderate symptoms, such as normal fever and/or operating.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV virus, MERS-CoV and newly recognized SARS-CoV-2 are highly resistant germs to cause disease, which cause a serious infection in the lower respiratory method for patients with greater risk of suffering from severe respiratory problems (ARDS) and non-specific problems.
The first type of HCoV-229E, B814, was released from fluids from the noses of patients with a standard fever in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge was collected through detailed research on HCoV-229E virus and HCoV-OC43, all of which cause symptoms of personal weakness.
In fact, the concept had been accepted among many that HCoV's overall impact is harmless until SARS's outbreak.
The SARS blast in 2003 is one of the worst leaks in current history, infecting over 8,000 people with a severe death rate for about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East's synromu virus (MERS) caused a continuing disaster in the Arab Peninsula while spreading another part of the world.
The 2019 HCoV virus (2019)-nCoV), which was later named SARS-CoV-2, is the result of the ongoing outbreak of the korona 2019 virus disease (COVID–19), which has killed over 3,120 people and infected them over 91,000 people by 3 March 2020.
The caution has existed with the world must provide yourself for the coming SARS-CoV-2 disaster.
All seven HCoV viruses are native to bats, mice or home animals.
Many evidence details support the nature of all HCoV virus from bats, where viruses are common and are not able to cause disease but show the condition of the egentism.
COVID-19 has presented major medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges in China and the world.
Tracking HCoV's source from animals provides a process of understanding natural history, motivation and prevention patterns to spread between animal species.
This can also lead or facilitate the search for asylum, middle carriers and carriers who distribute SARS-CoV-2, with an impact on preventing extremes in the future.
In this inspection we submit a summary of animal nature, distribution among the species of animals and HCoV's ability to cause disease.
Hususan, we shine and discuss the common subject that HCoV virus is usually unable to cause disease within its natural carriers but are able to cause disease after being spread between animal species to a new carrier.
We also monitor the current issues of HCoV growth where the increase in infectious ability is often accompanied by a decline in disease.
The results of the ongoing SAR-CoV-2 rebounds have also been discussed in this context.
CoVvirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the release of the first HCoV-229E species of B814 from fluids from the nose of patients who have contracted severe fever, various CoV viruses have been released from various infected animals, including ducks, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past decades, seven HCoV viruses have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoV's discovery in the temporary order (the 1) course can be educational and direct.
The first type of HCoV-229E was released through breathing of patients with a high-profile respiratory tract in 1966, and later continued to grow in the stages of the WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected HCoV-229E showed signs of normal fever, including headaches, sneezing, fatigue and stinging throat, with high heat and cough appearing in 10~20% cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 virus was released from joint cultivation and enrollment in the brains of breast-feed rats.
HCoV-OC43 medical components appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be distinguished from the dilutation from other respiratory virus such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E virus and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world, and appears to be more widespread during the winter season in a moderate climate.
In general, the time between infection and the emergence of this virus is less than a week and, followed by a disease of about 2 weeks.
According to human volunteer research, the health workers infected HCoV-229E had a normal fever.
The only few patients whose immunes are weak who showed severe exposure to the lower respiratory method.
SARSvirus, also known as "uncommon pneumonia", was the first disaster caused by HCoV in human history well copied by the biology agent is SARS-CoV virus, the third HCoV virus to be discovered.
SARS's first episode can be traced to late 2002 in the Gungdong Province in China.
The SARS disaster caused 8,096 cases reported by 774 deaths, and spread in many countries and lands.
Apart from the main extensions, it was estimated that each episode would trigger about two second cases and the period between infection and the appearance of 4 to 7 days and the maximum rate of the virus being seen on 10th day of illness.
Patients infected SARS-CoV originally show symptoms of pain in muscles, headaches, high heat, fatigue and a cold, then respiratory problems, cough and respiratory problems such as future symptoms.
The decline in the blood cells, a study of damaged liver function, and the rise of the kriatini is an unusual study of SARS's romance.
The breakdown of alveola, the rise of epithelia cells and the increase in the makrofes are also seen by SARS patients.
About 20–30% of patients later require deep treatment and respiratory aid machines.
Despite the lower respiratory method, many organs including the gut gas method, liver and kidney can also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by a saitokini explosion, which can be particularly dangerous for patients whose body immunity has been affected.
The virus was first released from a study of the patient's lung surgery who traveled from Hong Kong to Guangzhou.
Since then, sincere efforts are set up in HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 virus was released from the child of the age of the Netherlands in late 2004.
They were initially discovered to spread among small children, older people and patients whose immune immunity has been affected by respiratory diseases.
The appearance of the flu, the inflation of the eye's konjiktova, high heat and bronciolitisi is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another free study described the release of the same virus from nose samples from a young -8-month-old boy who was suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, they spread around the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 contributes to 47% of normal respiratory diseases and occurs extensively during the early summer period, zippers and winters.
HCoV-NL63 virus is associated with the burning of the throat blocking the throat, also called a fiduro.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 virus was released from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and blocked air routes in the lungs in Hong Kong.
Apart from social-based pneumonia and blocking air routes in the lungs, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with a severe increase in asthma.
A virus similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 were found worldwide and caused moderate asthma diseases.
All of these HCoV socially distributed viruses have found a way to stay in humans well and have limited potential to change to prevent viral disease, although accidents occurred for unknown reasons as in rare cases of smaller species with more than HCoV-NL63, which were recently reported to cause severe exposure to the lower respiratory method in China.
In general, these HCoV virus has gained the ability to distribute effectively and continue to maintain itself within humans, as well as their viral or pathogenetic ability is decreasing.
MERS-CoV virus was first released in 2012 from a 60-year-old lung patient who suffered severe pneumonia and fucking through urine transmission in Saudi Arabia.
Although many cases confirmed in romance occurred in the Middle East, cases from abroad that have spread from other people to the people who were closely influenced by them have been reported in European and Tunisia.
Another second blast occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS medical signs are similar to SARS, with a reputation for ongoing pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also suffered urine failure, which is very unique to MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
Over 30% of patients show symptoms of stomach problems, such as driving and transplanting.
By 14 February 2020, over 2500 cases confirmed in romance were reported with high mortality rates for 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the worst human-related viruses.
In the middle period until late December 2019, a collection of pneumonia patients originally known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization announced a continuing extension of low-speed respiratory transmission caused by SARS-CoV-2 as the Public Health Emergency of International Concern and also named the disease as COVID-19.
By 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide by the threatening rate of 3.4% deaths.
It is evident that the rate of deaths in Hubei County, China is 4.2%, while outside the county is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory reactions similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, evident as high heat in the body, cough and difficulty of breathing.
Driving is also evident to some patients.
Nimonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can continue to grow rapidly and become a severe rod of respiratory problems.
Although SARS-CoV virus and SARS-CoV-2 are closely identical due to a similar top series of 82% nukleotidi, they are united to be different branches in the filogenetic painting.
It is clear that SARS-CoV-2 has little potential to cause disease but its distribution is high compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
People who do not show signs of SARS-CoV-2 virus have been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 and six other HCoV types have raised similarities and very interesting differences.
First, the period between infection and the emergence and the period of HCoV's existence is the same.
Due to this, SARS-CoV-2 virus follows the normal condition of other HCoV viruses.
Second, the weight of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four HCoV virus distributed socially (i. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2's transmission shows qualities that are usually seen during the transmission of HCoV's social transmission, including showing specific symptoms, moderate or even absence of any symptoms.
On the other hand, a small group of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the SARS-CoV case, although the measurements are lower.
Third, SARS-COV-2 distribution also shows HCoV's interesting pattern distributed in the community by SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the ability to be distributed to SARS-CoV-2 at least is as high as that of the HCoV virus distributed socially.
On the other hand, it will remain confirmed if the ability to be spread to SARS-COV-2 decreases after human transmission as in SARS-CoV cases and MERS-CoV.
Finally, similar to other HCoV virus, SARS-CoV-2 virus can be discovered in a sample of feces.
If SARS-CoV-2 distribution through the feces on lips plays as important as in SARS-CoV's case at least under certain conditions remains open through future research.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 virus can occur in seasons as in HCoV cases distributed socially.
Despite this, SARS-CoV-2 components including the ability to be distributed, the ability to infect and continue to spread after human transmission will have influence on the ongoing COVID-19 review.
All four HCoVs widely distributed social viruses that cause average symptoms have become accustomed to humans.
In another perspective, it may also be the fact that humans are accustomed to these four HCoV viruses.
In other words, all may be the rest of HCoV's former disasters.
HCoV virus that causes severe diseases for humans and humans who received HCoV severe diseases have been removed.
It is what is done, HCoV virus must be made within humans at a reasonable rate of allowing a collection of changes that can fight the control patterns of a virus carrier.
With this logic, as SARS-CoV-2 rebounds and how more people are infected, there is a strong possibility that it will be common to humans.
If this virus is well common, its spread to humans can be difficult to control through the katanti or other measures to control the infection.
Over the years, four social-based CoV viruses have spread among people, and stimulate normal fever among people/humans with strong immunity.
These viruses do not need asylum within an animal.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV virus and MERS-CoV that are more widely distributed to humans and its spread among humans cannot be controlled.
They need to maintain and promote their reserves within animals and seek a chance to spread endangered humans, perhaps through the second and spreading carrier.
SARS-CoV-2 virus has the same reputation as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs distributed socially.
They are more likely to be distributed such as the HCoV virus distributed socially, at least at present.
However, it causes disease than the HCoV virus distributed socially and its potential for disease is lower than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It will remain to be seen if it is perfectly common for humans and spread into humans without a reserve or a carrier animal.
Before discussing the origins of HCoV animals, it will be good for us to discuss the definition and characteristics of the growing, natural, conservation and carrier of HCoV.
The animal serves as a HCoV plant carrier if he has preserved a close clan similar to the level of the nukliotidi series.
The organic virus is usually common and are unable to cause illness within this carrier.
Also, the reserve carrier has HCoV and long.
In all cases, viral carriers are naturally infected and are the natural HCoV carriers or its virus that are generations.
On the contrary, if HCoV virus has first entered the middle carrier before or about its human entry, they are not well-known in the new environment and often cause illness.
This middle carrier can serve as a source from human infection animals and carries out the role of the carrier by allowing the virus to be produced and then spread to humans to increase the rate of human infection.
HCoV virus can be through non-influence effects if they cannot maintain its distribution within the middle carrier.
On the other hand, HCoV virus can also be common within its middle carrier and even create a long-term condition.
In this case, the middle carrier becomes a natural carrier who keeps the virus.
The bio-specific data that revealed in a way of retreat that SARS's franchise had a history of wandering with wild animals.
The following study of the rate of infection indicated that animal traders had a high level of anti-SARS-CoV igG compared to the total population.
The rugby-face shield (Paguma larvata) and a rap dog in living animal markets were first recognized to carry a virus similar to SARS-CoV that are about to resemble SARS-CoV.
This was supported indirectly by the fact that there are no more SARS cases reported after the assassination of all the ngawa in the market.
However, it has been reported that the rugby-faces from the wild or in the countryside without wandering with animals sold in the market many of them were not found by SARS-CoV, and indicate that the host with a blessing surface can only serve as middle carriers of spreading but not the natural SARS-CoV reserve.
It will be revealed that, as 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodis fighting SARS-CoV, the possibility that many types of small mammals can also be used as SARS-CoV central carriers cannot be ignored.
All of these seem to be carriers without the impact of SARS-CoV.
The following search for an animal that is a natural SARS-CoV carrier showed that the CoV virus related to bats, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found within the Chinese horse bats of the horsehoe.
These Popo have antibodi against SARS-CoV and SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other CoV bats have 88–92 similar nukleotidi with SARS-CoV.
This study has laid the basis for new concepts that bats carry emerging human viruses.
Several Covvirus (SL-CoVs) similar to SARS have also been identified in bats, but none of them except WIV1 can be isolated as a living virus.
The human hormone that causes blood pressure that changes enzaim 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV receiver.
WIV1 virus released from a sample of bats feces were shown to use bats, ngawa and ACE2 human as a receiver to enter the cell.
Ironically, the policy from the recovery of SARS patients could destroy WIV1.
So far, WIV1 virus represents the very close generation of SARS-CoV on bats, with 95% of the similar nukleotidi pick.
With a significant similarity between these viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a virus between SARS-CoV and bats are not the middle carriers that preserve SARS-CoV.
The filogenetic analysis puts together MERS-CoV in a group similar to the CoV-HKU4 bat virus and CoV-HKU5 bat virus.
CoV-HKU4 bat virus and MERS-CoV use the same receivers of the carrier, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
RNA-references of the MERS-CoV RNA's RNA are about to resemble a filogentic and within the beta-CoV bats virus identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-COV virus can be found within wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest group of CoV-HKU25 bats virus have only 87% of nukleotidi.
Therefore, bats may not be middle-class carriers of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, a study conducted in the Middle East has shown that the tallest camels have a specific antibodi to balance MERS-CoV, similar to the native camels of the Middle East in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV virus-like virus found in humans was released from nose samples from the tallest camels, and further indicates that camels can be used as true MERS-CoV virus carriers.
It is also important to remember that the moderate but common symptoms of viruses were generally seen by the infected camels MERS-CoV for experiments.
It is evident that infected camels release viruses not only through a means of breathing but also through feces, which is also the main method of producing viruses from bats.
However, questions have not yet been answered as many cases of people confirmed by MERS have no history of wandering with camels before the beginning of symptoms, and signal the great humanization to humans or unknown distribution methods involving the species of animals that are not recognized carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 virus has 96.2% of nukleotidi similar to CoV RaTG13 bats released to Rhinolophus affins.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are the largest they cannot be fitted with a market relationship.
That is to say that bats may not be close carriers of SARS-CoV-2 unless the common bat virus will be found in the future.
It may be considered that the SARS-CoV-2 central animal should be among the species of wild animals sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Total Market, where most of the first COVID-19 cases were included, suggesting the possibility of a distribution event from animal to humans.
Many recent studies that focus on the membranes have indicated that a group of endangered small mammals known as a brother (Manis javanica) can carry traditional beta-CoV virus related to SARS-CoV-2.
These CoVs from the brother see you have 85–92% of the nukleotidi's pick similar to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, they are also equally related to RaTG13 for about 90% of identity at the nukleotidi series level.
It is arranged in two small viral communities similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a certification painting, one of them sharing the same organ (RBD) similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% of the series of amino acid recognition.
In a clear comparison, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and RaTG13 virus are quite different, although the large amount of the wide range of the tooth-speed tooth.
Early research at the sick brother also reported the discovery of viruses in kidney samples that, appeared to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used different collection and repair techniques to produce half a tooth pick with 86.3% of the full length of the viral tooth.
We can't shut out the possibility that the brother sees you is one of SARS-CoV-2 carriers.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct nature of SARS-CoV-2 brother from the differences between SARS-CoV-2 virus and beta-CoVs virus related to SARS-CoV-2 of the brother.
Also, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the one between beta-CoV virus related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 available to the brother.
The SARS-CoV-2 growth method in bats, the brother and other mammals are still being detected.
Although the highest similarity of the pick has been found on RBD between beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 available to the brother, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have a high similarity of the tooth.
It is widely estimated that the high level of similarities between the RBD of beta-CoV virus related to SARS-CoV-2 available within the brother and SARS-CoV-2 are linked to the growth of the convention brought on the basis of selection.
The opposition proposal supports reunification between beta-CoV virus related to SARS-CoV-2 available to the brother and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As an impulse in growth, reunification has spread among beta-CoV viruses.
The decision has not yet been reached about the near nature of SARS-CoV-2 from animals.
Apart from HCoV's main potential to cause disease, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 from animals has also been researched.
The certification evidence shows that HCoV-NL63 virus and HCoV-229E may have been derived from bat-CoV, with the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 virus found within the rat society.
It has been reported that the bat CoV virus called ARV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) discovered in Northern the United States three-colored bats showed a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E virus was related to other bat CoV virus, called Hipposideros/Ghana Kwam/2008, discovered in Ghana, with small camel species also suspected of being its middle carriers.
Clearly, current knowledge of the nature of HCoV virus animals known is set in a summary in the 1st painting and the 2nd Jeddi.
The certification analysis has provided evidence of HCoV distribution events between animal species in history.
While HCoV-OC43 virus spread between animals and human infection coming from animals around1890, the asthma pandemic was witnessed.
The history of distribution between HCoV-229E animals is not clear.
The alpha-CoV bat virus related to HCoV-229E has been found.
Among the virus is alpha-CoV virus available to alpaca who is a species of animal.
Several lines of evidence support the distribution of direct virus from bats to humans.
First, humans are not alpaca who are animals may have had contact with bats in the ecological environment.
Instead, humans are wandering closely with alpaca who are animals.
Second, alpha-CoVs of bats related to HCoV-229E is different from the ability to cause disease within bats, while alpha-CoV virus found in alpaca caused a respiratory outbreak to infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV virus found in alpaca has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, alpaca's possibility of getting alpha-CoV virus related to HCoV-229E from humans cannot be locked out.
Indeed, bats are the direct source of human disease-related viruses including dog's mad virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
So it is not very strange that bats have the ability to distribute HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Other than, although alpha-CoV virus is used as a HCoV-229E gene component, alpaca and the tallest camels may be used as middle-speed carriers of viruses to humans, especially in MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV virus is used as an excellent example of distribution between animals from bats to long camels and from long camels to humans.
The origin of MERS-CoV growth from bats is known in its first recognition and has also been confirmed by the following results.
It is clear that bats provide a major collection of viruses for interchanges between animal components and distribution between animals.
The ability to live for a long time, a home with many animals, close social interactions and the strong ability to fly are the conditions that make bats 'a animal that can spread viruses'.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been within the long camels for decades.
They were well-known within these camels who have turned from the central carriers of the virus to become stable and natural carriers that preserve the virus.
MERS-CoV causes severe illness and maintains a low rate of change compared among these animals.
Its immediate human distribution is fate and humans remain the last MERS-CoV carriers because its distribution cannot last.
On the contrary, the role of camels in the MERS-CoV distribution, the role of the brother saw you, if anything, in SARS-CoV-2 distribution is different.
Hususan, beta-CoV virus available to the brother see you have a great capacity to cause disease within the brother.
They may be the beta-CoV virus carriers related to SARS-CoV-2-unconfessive, similar to ngawa in SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 distribution between animals from animals to humans must be accepted or rejected in future sku research.
First, bats may be the conservation carriers related to SARS-CoV-2 about to resemble SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the ecological environment and bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the brother may be one of the middle carriers that have found viruses related to SARS-CoV-2 for the first time.
Man gets a virus through slaughtering and eating wild meat.
There is a possibility that many mammals including home animals can find SARS-CoV-2.
A study of home and wild animals for antibodi is worth it.
Third, as mentioned above, the re-operation and inclusion of SARS-CoV-2 may have been held in the third creature that was inducted by bats and the brother.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 seal from animals is still underway.
Apart from different types of carriers, three main models on the side of the virus are also important in enabling the CoVs virus to be spread to creatures.
First of all, their high levels of change in RNA production.
Comparing to other RNA virus, the estimated levels of CoV change may be considered to be "high" or "high" with the average exchange rate being ~10–4 per year per 2 area, based on the CoV in its new carrier.
CoVs virus has eksoribonuksi of the urrusu, whose dismissal causes increased the ability to change, reduce its impact or even its ability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide drug alogue Remdesivir is known to have the production of CoV through the prevention of the eksoribonuklis and RNA polymerisi based on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most powerful vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 tested for medical tests.
Despite this, the levels of CoV change are about a million times more than its carriers.
Also, the rate of change is often high when the CoV virus is not common on the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV virus with high levels of change, SARS-CoV-2 change rates are evident that they are low, a condition that suggests the highest potential for humanization.
It can be taken that, they have already been common to another human carrier.
Along with SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, a virus that has been well-known within the tallest camels.
The theory, there is no possibility that chemical changes can cause vaccines and anti-virus anti-CoV-2 drugs not to be suitable quickly.
Second, the large RNA tooth on CoVs has more ability to change shape in tooth repair for change and reunification, thus increasing the potential for growth together between creatures, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoV conditions suitable.
These are supported by the open frames and the function of proteins sung towards the end of 3 of the tooth.
Third, CoV without order and occasionally changes the model during RNA production through a special "copy-choice".
Inside a virus carrier used as a mixer, the standi exchange takes place occasionally during the CoV RNA copying.
The most identical RNAs of the full length and the small tooth can be reunited to produce the new COV.
The certification of natural integration has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as the CV virus found in animals such as the SL-CoV virus of bats and CoV-HKU9 bat virus.
A virus carrier associated with distribution
Apart from three models of the virus mentioned above, the interaction of the carrier's virus is another important example of influence on distribution between creatures.
Here, SARS-CoV's reunification is considered to be a common example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during the events of distribution between creatures.
According to a comparison analysis between SARS-CoV within humans and ngawa, SARS-CoV is thought to be quickly introduced into different carriers, especially for changes in S's RBD protein RBD.
In total, RBD on the CV protein interacts with the cell receiver and is highly appointed by the an antibodi answer to the carrier.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the amino acid of 318 and 510 in the S1 piece, which you don't have a human ACE2 as well as the main receivers for the entry of the virus.
The SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to identify the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, ngawa, mice and dogs, allowing the distribution of viruses between creatures.
In fact, only 6 remains of amino acids were found to be different from the human-based virus and ngawa on RBD and 4 of them are in the connecting of receivers for interventions and receivers of ACE2.
SARS-CoV virus within the Ngawa has a change of K479N and S487T on its RBD, which can increase the possibility of the S protein and human receivers of ACE2.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be important in the virus.
It is important to remember that SARS-CoV-2 virus has similar cell receptors and SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at the S1 S1 protein unit suggests that the ability of S's protein to be connected with the human ACE2 may have changed.
Of course, the cryo-EM research shows the possibility of a 10-to-more than this gap than between the human protein of ACE2 and SARS-CoV S.
It will be interesting to determine if any vyenzas may be required for SARS-CoV-2 distribution.
Ironically, HCoV-NL63 also does not have a button on ACE2 but in a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidisi N of HCoV-229E, and the acid to fight the 9-O-acetylated of HCoV-OC43.
They can also cause the effectiveness of these CoV virus to humans after the distribution of species from their carriers.
Despite cell receivers, the results of HCoV distribution between creatures are also dominated by the support and other carriers and prevention patterns.
The difference of these animal proteins between humans and natural carriers of HCoV viruses such as bats, the tallest camels and weed animals may be a setback to distribution between creatures.
HCoV virus must be used for viral carriers and change the anti-virus blockage devices to succeed in distributing viruses between organisms.
For this chip, the mellicles in this important part of the interaction between the virus and its carrier are still not recognized and classified.
A thorough inspection of the tooth carrier with a teemetery and SARS-CoV-2 prevention patterns using its CRISPR technology may produce fruit.
The emergence of the new HCoV virus: going back completely
Various types of bat CoV offer plenty of opportunities for the emergence of the new HCoV.
With this logic, the CoV virus of bats serves as a collection of HCoV genes.
Despite this, rapid change and merger also enable HCoV growth and becomes two key steps in this process.
For example, getting or losing a new protein-based gene is likely to quickly change a virus sample.
Among SARS-CoV's access proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in humanization, as SARS-CoV virus related to bats were released but were found to sing different ORF8 proteins.
The reputation of 29 SARS-CoV nukleotidis has been found in samples set aside at the beginning of the human disaster.
This album divides ORF8 became ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a change in the process of the transmission of viral carriers.
Also, SARS-CoV has the possibility of having a history of merger with alpha-and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of small areas of merger was identified on RNA polymerisi based on RNA.
The connecting areas were also identified in nsp9, many nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
It has also been shown that the MERS-CoV disaster witnessed the events of integration between different generations, which occurred in the tallest camels in Saudi Arabia.
Along with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, re-unification events that other HCoV species have also been witnessed, where the various HCoVs are reunited with other CoV virus on their non-shaped genes.
A caution should also be remembered that artificial selection can contribute to non-defeated changes in viral tooth, often due to the removal of the selection pressure, such as the immune system of the virus carrier.
The example of these effects is the loss of the full length of ORF4 in the original HCoV-229E sample, due to the dismissal of two nukleotidi.
With ORF4 solid with the possibility of being found in viruses found in bats and camels related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV virus found on the alpaca showed the installation of a single nukleotidi, causing a frame change.
Finally, the growth of the new HCoV virus also comes from the pressure of selection at the virus carrier's reserve.
The absence of symptoms or moderate symptoms were discovered when bats were infected by CoV, suggesting a joint transmission between CoV and bats.
It seemed that the CoV virus was well-seasoned with bats and physical function.
For example, a misunderstanding in coping with burning conditions within bats was successful in reducing the ability to cause disease that is made possible by CoV.
Also, the operation of the natural killer cell on bats has been absorbed due to the production of receptors of the natural cell of NKG2/CD94 and the lower level of the I species of tissue mixture.
In addition, a large amount of active oxygen species (ROS) produced from many activity in the body of bats can swallow the CoV and affect Eksoribonuklis reviews, thus providing the pressure of selection for the production of a type of virus with the ability to cause disease when it is introduced into a new environment.
More samples to cause CoV can grow through re-unification, resulting in the availability of new protein or protein qualities for the transmission of the carrier.
Thus, it is not unfortunately that three new HCoVs viruses have emerged over the past two decades.
CoV virus is not capable of causing disease or causes moderate symptoms for conservation carriers such as bats and camels.
It is produced in abundance without showing the strong contact of its carrier's body.
Here's a secret about why non-discorporated carriers are found and that causes severe cases in human infection.
The severe symptoms often result from the strong motivation of the body’s immunity to fight too much by the saitokini explosion where the body’s immunity is very stable, the lungs are more damaged.
On the other hand, in non-discorporated carriers, the immune confrontation is separated from CoV production.
The same strategy to separate the immune confrontation may be useful in medicine against SARS-CoV-2.
The effect of proteins produced by a virus carrier is particularly stable on bats.
Thus, the release of proteins provided by the I virus carrier at least in the early SARS-CoV-2 phase in humans should be useful.
Moreover, NLRP3 inflammsome on bats is harmful.
With this logic, NLRP3 inflammsome using MCC950 can be important in COVID-19 treatment.
SARS-CoV-2's emergence follows a general style where SARS-CoV virus and MERS-CoV emerged.
Although beta-CoV bats virus with 95% of nukleotidi and SARS-CoV have been found, there are also-CoV bat virus and 96% of nukleotidi and SARS-CoV-2.
Although ngawa and other animals in the market have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV, the nearby SARS-CoV-2 carriers have not been identified.
Beta-CoVs virus available to the brothers that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, this suggests that the brothers may be middle carriers or beta-CoV virus available to the brother can contribute to gene fragments to the last type of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions still remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 virus is deliberately made by humans by bad luck.
CoV virus has returned to ten again due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 rebound.
The study of the CoV virus within bats and other animals has quickly changed our attitudes about the importance of animal slaughter and the preservation of HCoV animals in human distribution.
The widespread evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have roots from bats and are distributed to humans through middle carriers.
Since SARS-CoV's transmission comes from human integration and ngawa in the market, closing the animal markets and killing all the nugawa there would help it would succeed in ending SARS disaster.
With similar logic, the brother saw you should be removed from the animal market to prevent animal distribution, due to the discovery of many generations of beta-CoV available to the brothers related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 virus is distributed to humans through a brother and other mammals remain open in future investigation.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been in the longest camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important tool in transporting along with the main source of meat, milk, leather products and cotton products for people in the street.
They have spread widely across the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to kill all camels to control MERS, as done in Chinese wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop MERS' frequent leaks, the direction todoti should be taken to create a suitable vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, as well as other strategies to control the transmission.
Because we cannot remove this virus, a new type can emerge and cause leaks.
Many types of CoV virus distributed by animals are distributed in the wild.
Hususan, CoV virus caused by bats with the ability to be distributed by animals is too fatal.
There are many opportunities where these CoV virus distributed by animals grows and reunited, resulting in the emergence of other CoV viruses that are more distributed by/or are the most dangerous for humans in the future.
The culture of wild animals in some areas of China should be left to reduce the interaction between humans and animals.
Because of the existence of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, the situation of good preparation and the counter plan should be placed.
Indeed, many viruses have existed in the world for a long time.
This virus lives in their natural reserves until there is an opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many qualities that enable the spread of viruses, the human space to wander with bats and other wild creatures can be reduced if people are educated to stay away from the animals.
It is important to investigate the continued animal to better understand the CoV and their natural carriers, which will show it necessary to prevent distribution from animal to humans and future leaks.
To conclude, the best way to prevent the distribution of viruses from animals is for humans to stay away from the biological environment of natural viral conservationists distributed from animals.
There are still many unknown things about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from animals.
First, if bats distribute SARS-CoV-2 virus to the brother, it will be interesting to see what conditions bats and brothers can be found in the same ecological environment.
Second, if bats have a more direct position in human distribution, it should be recognized how humans are influenced by bats.
Third, if the third mammal is to serve as a real middle carrier, it should be defined how the animal interacts with other creatures including humans, bats and brothers.
Finally, since other animals including home animals may be at risk of getting SARS-CoV-2, investigative and experimental transmission should be operated.
If it is bats, a brother or another animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its virus is almost identical to be identified on its natural carriers in the future.
The continuation of the investigation in this field will identify the way of SARS-CoV-2 growth in animals, and the key impact in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Retrieved the "predicted test process" and "confirmed" COVID-19 is important
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick-season advice guide and treatment of new korona 2019 virus (2019-nCoV), and guidance provided our experience and put good references for fighting this major disaster worldwide.
However, the korona 2019 virus (COVID-19) is a new illness, our awareness and knowledge continue to develop according to the ongoing results of the ongoing tertiary and the experience of medical actions; so, testing and medical tests are also continuing to be decided.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our guidance and provided a new process of "a suspected test" and "a confirmed klicho" according to the recent Guides of COVID-19 (seven edition) released by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 new korona virus (2019)-nCoV) has caused a re-election, now officially called a korona 2019 virus disease (COVID-19) and its virus has been named after severe acessary syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a major disaster.
To fight SARS-CoV-2, our team has created a quick advice guide and has been published online on Army Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
You have attracted great attention since its publication.
Remember, however, that COVID-19 is a new illness, our awareness and knowledge are increasing according to the results of ongoing research and medical experience, so the strategies for investigation and treatment are also underway.
For example, the COVID-19 Survey and Treatment Guides released by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, has provided a total of seven editions while some of the contexts are adapted content.
Now our guidance received comments from Zhou and his colleagues., they brought a simple proposal to get the instrument according to their medical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guidance and also to make a valuable reference to this tragedy around the world.
We recommend their vital work and give our gratitude.
However, their work also needs to be transferred according to the recent Guide of COVID-19 Surveying and Treatment (the seventh test) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020, confirming suspected cases requires to include any single component of biobiological history and two bio-references to make a test or demand to meet three clinical manifestations if there is no clear history of biobiology:
Archaeological history: (1) the history of travel or living in Wuhan and the surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days before the beginning of symptoms; (2) the history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 cases (in positive measurements of nyklea acid); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperatures or asthma from Wuhan and nearby areas or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the past 14 days before the beginning of the symptoms; (4) the history of contact with the confirmed collection (s) or more than 2 more heats of the body/or of the body/or of the body's symptoms within the small areas of the school, such as the school.
Medical manifestation: (1) high body heat and/or asthma symptoms; (2) visible characteristics of COVID-19; (3) the total number of white blood cells featuring the normal number, reduced white blood cells in the early phase.
A confirmed test should be based on the case with a suspected case of any viral evidence or physiology as follows: (1) the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 virus for a real time through PCR measurements; (2) the entire genome of the virus that shows a large similarity with new korona virus known; (3) there is a specific antibodi of IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in the measure of the policy; or the change of the specific IgG of SARS-CoV-2 to be present or more than 4 times in the most critical phase of the disease.
We can see that PCR's actual measure for nuclear acid on the respiratory or blood sample was added to the second edition of (Tarehe 18 January 2020) and third (Tarehe 22 January 2020).
The discovery of the blood sample was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); and the bioscience evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These amendments according to researchers continued the job of finding a better package to detect nyklea acid for quick testing, as well as samples from asthma including blood samples, which increased the packaging of different samples and helped to be brought with a positive effect of specific antibodi in a proven process.
Besides, there is much more evidence that reminds us of being cautious of patients with symptoms in an unusual way and those who have no symptoms.
Thus, Zhou's chart and his colleagues should be decided, because it classified a person without medical symptoms as "low risk".
The mark system also needs to be confirmed in later medical actions and research.
To complete, we hope the most direct evidence will emerge and we're telling readers to express their opinion.
For "a suspected test" and "confirmed" testing, we suggest being followed by the allegiance of new guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also temporarily challenge our guidance to provide help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest cases reported daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 for that day.
This is the highest number of deaths that occur per day from the virus.
By yesterday, Bangladesh's Epidemiology Institute, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of recorded cases of infection that included 114 cases with 33 cases of people living at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news report, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were of people over 60, two between 51 and 60 years of age and one 41–50.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a major disaster on 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu, an internal news agency that one of their deaths was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director at the Anti-Corruption Commission in Bengani, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Transport Obaidul Quader said public transport would be closed for more time than previously planned, until this next Saturday.
The closure of this public transport had begun earlier on 26 March and was planned to end on Saturday, on 4.
Transport of essential products -- medical, fuel and food -- it was still allowed.
The first events of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on 8 March, for two people who returned from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
By 19 March, these three people had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 virus exceeds a million outbreaks worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of korona SARS-CoV-2 virus cases passed a million worldwide, data from Johns Hopkins University showed so.
At least 52 thousand deaths were associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the korona virus.
This summit was reached on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first release of the korona and Zambia cases confirmed the first death related to the korona virus.
North Korea announced, by Thursday, that it was one of the few countries that did not have a korona virus.
By yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours before 10 a.m., Central European Hours (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of korona virus were recorded, combining the air to 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, there were over 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by koronavirus.
Around the world, various countries announced more serious measures to prevent this disease from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow, was continued to be closed by city operations until 1 May.
National President Vladimir Putin announced that Russian citizens will continue to be paid without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to increase the national emergency for 15 days; the vote passed by 215 votes of support, ten MPs who chose not to participate in the vote and one of the opposing vote.
Saudi Arabia added the kafyu day in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to continue for the whole day; originally, the kafyu was between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to carry out the kafyu between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state increased the public order to stay home until 1 May.
Stores in Australia reduced the number of hard paper that one could buy
On Sunday evening and Saturday, Australian supermarkets of Woolworths and Coles reduced their paper shopping units to two and one will call for each single in all stores at the national level.
ALDI also launched a single package limit, on Monday.
These positions were published as a message in pay sites and on the Facebook pages of stores.
Consumers were reported to buy goods in abundance due to COVID-19 fear if people need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolsworth also placed a touchdown for paper purchase from the presentation home to one package per order.
These changes followed the original four packages for each single-levels set by Woolsworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March.
Coles, in his press report on 8 March, reported that even after putting the four paper package, "the rest of the paper was still selling all paper products within an hour of being presented", and cited the need as "not expected", with ALDI, on Facebook publication on Tuesday calling it "not expected".
Sales increased "in the top talk" last week, according to Wolsworths spokesman.
The Costco store at Canberra also placed the standard allowed to be two packages last week.
In response to the shortage, Coles hung large packages from the bid and added occasionally to submit products, Woolworths ordered additional products, while ALDI made goods for special Wednesday plans earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Marketing Corporation, said that retailers try to increase products, but the restrictions of the local council about the delivery of goods by car disabled his rai.
He expects to rise at production costs, with suppliers trying to meet a few special needs and plans.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that the early release of goods, some stores cannot operate a special Wednesday plan.
In News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retailer from Queensland University of Technology, said that their stores fill goods every night.
He noted that the sheet is a large product, which causes a small number of goods and sold, leaves large parts of their shelves empty and increase the feeling of deficit.
Coles and Woolworths have a view that if there were enough products on the shelf, including products such as shishi paper and selectives could be bought and available in abundance, there is a possibility of reducing anxiety, said Russell Zimmerman according to ABC News.
The paper-making company from the paper used in Who Gives a Crap said on last Wednesday that they sold all their products.
Kimberly-Clark, a company that produces Kleenex Toilet Tisue and Solaris Paper producing Sorbent, insisted that they were working 24/7 hours to maintain the distribution of products, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a residential area, reported that some property dealers donated paper to the first brokers in the picnic in Melbourne, while a few auctions were made due to consumers to get a vacation from the long wing of Leba Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily published newspaper in Darwin, included a section with eight pages of cutting and used as a shishi paper.
Stores previously did not want to place restrictions, to shine with reports from ABC Australia on 3 March where they said they have no plans to set up shopping restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a high need, including landkoa, chips, dry foods, soap washing hands and flour.
Also, outside Australia, on Sunday evening, the British web store Ocado seemed to reduce the purchase of Andres' paper to 12 sheets.
The World Health Organization has announced a widespread COVID-19 disease
Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced the continuing outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by the korona SARS-CoV-2 virus — as a major disaster.
Although the word "largely" indicates how widespread illness was, it is not how dangerous specific cases are, the World Health Organization saw the importance of encouraging nations to be a step:
All countries can still change the stage of this major disaster.
If countries recognize, measure, treat, isolate, track and encourage their people in response, said Tedros Adharom Ghebreyus, Director-Prince of the World Health Organization.
We are concerned about the standards of exposure and severity and terrifying standards of non-activity.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention, this major disaster "is unique."
He said, in a comment published by CNN February, "but with influenza, no respiratory virus was traced from spread to continuing to spread internationally."
Ghebreyesus commented similar, saying "We've never seen a major disaster caused by the korona virus before."
He continued, "and we've never seen a great tragedy that can be controlled at once."
A new situation as a major disaster follows the decision of the World Health Organization in January to announce the outbreak of this disease as a public health emergency for international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Hemisphere and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak of illness, "the foundation, goes worse."
As of Thursday, the United States Broadcasting Corporation reported there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases in the world, which resulted in over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 major korona virus crisis is a major disaster that goes on to the 2019 korona virus (COVID–19), caused by severe respiratory complications 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak of illness was recognized Wuhan, China, December 2019, was declared a concern for International Health Emergency on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a major disaster on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 nations and asylums, causing about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rates have been estimated to be 4% China, while internationally are different from 13.04% Algeria to .08% New Zealand.
Common symptoms include high temperatures, cough and failure to breathe properly.
Problems may include pneumonia and chronic lung disease.
When from infection to the appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may be between two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or special antivirus treatment.
The primary treatment is to treat the symptoms of illness and treatment aid. The proposed preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth when you cough, maintaining distances from other people, and monitoring and isolation of suspected people are infected.
Organizations around the world have taken action by setting restrictions on travel, placing karatini, periods of not walking, dangerous restrictions at work, and the closure of buildings.
This major tragedy has caused serious social and economic unrest, delay or frustration of spot, religious, political and cultural events, and the spread of the shortage of goods due to the purchase of fear.
Schools and universities are closed on international or local base in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of the world's student population.
The lies about viruses have spread online, and there have been incidents of discrimination from other countries and discrimination against Chinese, other people from East and South-east Asian areas or have the appearance, and others from areas with multiple viral cases.
Following reduced transport and closure of large industries, there has been a shortage of air pollution and carbon production.
Health Organizations Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported cases of pneumonia with no source known on 31 January 2019, and investigations were introduced at the beginning of January 2020.
The cases were related to Huanan's Total Sea Food Market and so the virus is thought to have a source of distribution from animals to humans.
The virus that caused the outbreak of disease is known as SARS-CoV-2, new viruses discovered and related to bats virus, the korona virus of the brother, and SARS-CoV. The first person known and the symptoms was identified with suffering on 1 December 2019, and the man had no visible relationship with anyone in the market.
In the previous events reported on December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a connection with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Magazine of the Morning said that there was a case followed to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man from Hubei province, may be the first episode.Tarehe 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that, how new cases said were declining in China but exceeded Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a lack of serious cases, especially among those with low symptoms.
As of 26 February, at least a few cases were reported in young people, those aged 19 and down at 2.4% of the world's cases. British Scientific Chief Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK's population will need to be infected before the defense of the field will be found through vaccines.
Cases mean the number of people measured by COVID-19, and their measure is confirmed to be positive according to official consensus.
By 23 March, no country measured over 3% of the population, and many countries have had official policies not to measure those with only weak symptoms, such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
Research published on 16 March found that China, by 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 attacks had not been discovered and that these unwritten transmissions were the source of 79% of the cases copied.
A study of 30 March estimated that the Italian number was much more than reported cases.
The original reflection of the primary production number (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it could be 5.7.
Many people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not see, time from the appearance of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, regular day numbers as 14.
By 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, up to 5 February 80% of deaths were for those over 60, and 75% had previously health conditions with heart and vascular diseases and diabetes. Official death rates due to the major COVID-19 disaster generally means dead people who were measured and positive to COVID according to the official utilitarian.
The sure number of deaths from COVID-19 may be more, as it may not include dead people without testing - k.m. home, in nursing rooms, etc.
The only amount of data from Italy became the number of additional deaths in a major disaster increased the official number of COVID deaths for the 4–5x element.
A spokesman for the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention admitted "We know that [the condition mentioned of death] is a low estimate", a statement confirmed by confirmed reports of poor counting in the United States. The lower rate often occurs in a major disaster, as a disease of the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. The first confirmed death was Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China Continent occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first outside Asia was France on 14 February.
By 28 February, outside China Continent, more than several deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries had reported deaths, in every continent except Antarctica. Several measures serve to count deaths.
These numbers differ from the area and when it exceeds, they are affected by the level of measurement, quality of the health care system, the type of treatment, during the first appearance, and the population as age, gender, and health conditions in general. The death rate to the episode shows the death number divided by the number of cases identified in some time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the international ratio of death-hadi-kisa is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) by 10 April 2020.
The numbers differ according to the area.
In China, estimates of the death rate compared to the episode were reduced from 17.3% (to people with symptoms from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (to people with symptoms from 1 February 2020). Other measurements include the death rate for each case (CFR), which highlights the percentage of people who die from illness, the death rate from the infection (IFR), which highlights the percentage of infected people (tested and who were not measured) die from illness.
These statistics are not closed by a temporary model and follow a specific number of people from the event of the release until the solution of the case.
The number of scholars have tried to count these numbers in special numbers.
The Oxford University's Drug Center for Evidence estimates that death rates due to the impact for a perfect disaster are between 0.1% and 0.9%.
High estimates of this percentage are comparable to results from the test of chance for COVID-19 Germany, and data studies to investigate the impact of CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization claims that this major disaster can be controlled.
The peak and time of the outbreak of this disease is unknown and may differ from the area.
Maciij Boni of Penn State University said, "If they don't be traced, the outbreak of infection usually continues and then begins to decline when illness is being infected.
But it's hard to estimate or have a critical estimate now about when it's".
Chinese government chief adviser Zhong Nanshan said that "it may cease by June" if all countries can be encouraged to follow the advice of the World Health Organization for the end of the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski London Institute of Health Clean & Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to spread, there is a possibility of a year or two".
According to Imperial College investigation led by Neil Ferguson, maintaining distances and other measures will be required "until the vaccine is available (there is a possibility of 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think there is no possibility that this korona virus—because easily infected—it will be completely lost" and may be "a season disease, if it happens every year".
The condition of the restoration of the return will depend on vaccines found and the rate of viral change.
COVID-19 symptoms may be not special and people were infected may not show any symptoms.
Two common symptoms are high temperature (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Uncommon symptoms include fatigue, respiratory cough (hozi), loss of smell, failure to breathe well, muscle pain and joints, throat pain, headaches, feeling cold, vomiting, coughing, driving, or skin to be blue. The World Health Organization says that about one person out of six is very ill and trouble breathing.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention is a result of emergency symptoms such as a failure to breathe properly, chronic chest pain or pressure, sudden anxiety, difficulty walking, face or blue lips; quick treatment is advised if these symptoms exist. The progress of illness can cause severe lung hepatitis, chronic lung disease, muscle infection, shock and death.
Some of infected people may not show any symptoms, without any medical symptoms but their test results prove that they are infected, so researchers have advised that those who have been infected with people who have been confirmed should be traced and examined to eliminate fear of infection.
The Chinese estimate the measure range of people who do not show symptoms from a few to 44%.
The normal period of the existence of symptoms (the period between infection and the appearance of symptoms) from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. For example of uncertainty, the estimate of the part of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was originally 30% and later dropped to 15%.
Other details about how the disease is transmitted are still being investigated.
The disease is believed to be infected primarily during being close to drops from coughing, sneezing, or talking; and someone who is about to be 1 to 2 feet (3 to 6).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can enable drops to 4.5 feet (4.5 m) to 8.2 m (6 m).
Some people have suggested that this virus can also be distributed by the remaining small drops in the air, which can come from the time of conversation, which can also be able to get out of breathing time, as well as when speaking, but these viruses are generally not infected through the air.
These drops are able to reach the lips or noses of nearby people or be drawn to the lungs.
Other medical processes such as the installation of the tube and the revival of the heart and lungs (CPR) can cause respiratory fluids to be absorbed in the air and thus spread through the air.
It can also be spread when a person touches a virus, along with the skin, and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
There is some doubt that it can be spread by feces, the danger is believed to be inferior.
The Chinese government opposed the possibility of distribution from the feces to the mouth of SARS-CoV-2. These Russians are heavily infected three days after the appearance of symptoms, although the distribution is possible before the symptoms are seen and in the later stages of illness.
People have been tested and found positive to illness until three days before the appearance of symptoms indicates that distribution is possible before many symptoms have occurred.
There are only a few reports of confirmed cases of people who do not show any symptoms while they have a virus, but cases of infected and non-recognitions have been recognized by other countries while following people who are in contact with patients.
The European Disease Prevention and Control Center (ECDC) notes that although it is not perfectly clear that it is not perfectly clear for this disease to spread, one person generally infects two or three people. Russians have the ability to pray alive in various places for hours to day.
Haswa, this virus was found to be detected to three days in plastic and steel that does not enter 304 rust, for one day on the cardboard, and to four hours for copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature levels, and other animals have been found by COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can spread this virus to humans, but the British authorities advise washing hands after touching animals, as after touching the infected areas may have touched.
A chronic lung disease attached to the korona 2 (SARS-CoV-CoV-2) is a new virus, first found from three people with pneumonia related to cases of chronic respiratory diseases Wuhan.
Signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in the world's related korona virus.The human body, this virus is eaten by home-use soap, breaking the surrounding flower.SARS-CoV-2 has a close relationship with the natural SARS-CoV.
It is thought to be an infection from animals to humans.
Genetic analysis has shown that the korona virus merges with the korona Beta virus cell, in the small species of Sarbe (generation B) as well as two species from bats.
It is similar to 96% in the cell level for other korona virus samples in bats (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acid in a part of the cell order between these viruses from the brother and those from humans.
All cell comparisons have so far discovered in high condition 92% of the cell resources found in the brother's korona virus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove the brother to see you as a central parasite creature.
The infection of this virus can be temporarily recognized by the symptoms, but the evidence is ultimately following the process of returning to the chemical cell and the metabolism (rRT-PCR) of infected liquids or CT medical photography.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has proposed that CT is much better than PCR, though not specific, and its photo components interfere with other lung hepatitis and disease processes.
By March 2020, Radiology College United States recommends that "CT is not to be used to filter or as a first test method to identify COVID-19".
WHO has published a majority of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the first publication released on 17 January.
The experiment uses to return to the chemical cell and the series (rRT-PCR).
An experiment can be done with respiratory or blood samples.
The overall results are found within hours until a few days.
This experiment is generally implemented using cotton within the nose though taking samples in the mouth are also able to be used. Several laboratories and companies create a blood-based test, which recognizes the body's immunity.
By 6 April 2020, none of these were proved real to be approved for use by many.
The United States a blood test is designed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use and only approved lab.
The characteristics of radiology and computer medical images (CT) of people who are infected include a part of the lungs with low pressure without equal pressure and lack of a liquid collection between the chest wall and lungs.
The Italian Radiology Society collects an international park online of the results of medical images of confirmed cases.
Due to other interventions such as adenovirus, giving images without proof through PCR has a shortage of specific issues in identifying COVID-19.
A major Chinese study compared the results of CT's chest and PCR's chest image and showed that although medical images are not special for the transmission, it is fast and better, showing its attention as a filter device in the disaster areas.
Online programs created by non-natural intelligence have been designed to detect the components of viral and medical images and CT.
The process of preventing the spread of disease includes maintaining personal hygiene in general, washing hands, blocking the eyes, nose, or mouth and hands that are not washed, and coughing or sneeze on the tissue and put dirty tissue directly into the waste vessel.
Those who may be infected have already been advised to wear a public medical land.
The measures to maintain distance are also proposed to prevent distribution. Many governments have imposed restrictions or advised against any unnecessary journey towards and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak of disease.
However, these viruses have reached the point of spreading society in several parts of the world.
This means that viruses are spreading within the community and some of the community are unaware of where or how they were infected. They provide medical services who have treated someone who may be infected are recommended to use common precautions, precautions of contact with eye protection. Tracking people who touched each other is an important way of health authority to determine the source of infection and prevent further distribution.
The use of local data from runu phones and the government for this use has sparked concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations to make an announcement wanting to be placed by such surveillance.
Different runu phone programs have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and by April 7, 2020, more than twelve teams of experts were creating a solution that protects privacy, such as using Bluetooth to send the distance of the user and other runu phones.
The user then receives messages if they have been close to anyone who has been measured and found by COVID-19. The decade is spreading about how to prevent the infection; for example, cleaning the nose and scraping and the ingredients of cleaning the mouth are not a perfect.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are dealing with one.
It is recommended to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC recommends people wash their hands occasionally with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if your hands seem dirty; before eating; after scraping the scissors, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, this virus is eaten by home-use soap, which blasts its protective foam.
CDC further recommends using a hand liquid with alcohol - contaminated germs with at least 60 percent of alcohol in moderation when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people not to keep their eyes, nose, or mouth and hands that are not washed.
The used parts are able to be cleaned and kill viruses using different chemicals (in one minute of using chemicals in part with non-speed steel), as well as 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrojeni peroxide, and 0.2–7.5%povidone-iodine.
Other sehus, such as bezalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, have not been very successful.
CDC recommends that if COVID's case is suspected or confirmed in a building such as offices or schools for child care, every place such as offices, bathrooms, living room, electronic devices such as flat computers, egus, keyboards, and ATM machines used by patients, should be cleaned by pesticides.
Health agencies suggested that people cover their lips and balloons with folded elbow or tissue when they cough or sneeze, and throw any tissue at once.
The medical land is recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing mainlands can control the amount and distance to travel by breathing drops distributed when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has provided time instructions and how to use the continent.
According to Stephen Griffin, a viral scientist at Leeds University, "The wearing of the continent can reduce [of] people touch their face, which is a major source of infection without the best purity of hands. "Barakoa has also been recommended for use by those who care for anyone who can have this disease.
WHO recommends wearing a continent and healthy people only if they are at risk, such as those who care for someone with COVID-19, although they have also admitted that wearing a continent can help people touch their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of land and public people.
The United States, CDC recommends wearing non-medical but made of fabric.Uchina has especially proposed the use of medical land that can be thrown by people with good public health, especially as it approaches ($1 m) or a little) and other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing medical land when using public transportation or staying in places where there are many people.
Thailand's health officials urge people to make landland with cloths at home and wash them daily.
The Czech and Slovakia Republic banned going out publicly without wearing mainland or covering your noses and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked everyone to wear mainlands while they go to public areas to protect themselves from others.
The Austrian government ordered everyone entering the store must wear the mainland.
Israel has asked all residents to wear land in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million continents every day from mid-March, required passengers on trains and city buss to the city to wear the forehead on 1 date.
Panama has made it necessary to wear the continent every time you go out, while also proposes the production of the continent at home for those who can't buy the mainland.
Barakoa has been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Staying far from society (also known as non-conventional) includes the actions of the control of the infection that is intended to reduce the distribution of disease by reducing contact between people.
The strategy includes; travel restrictions; the closure of schools, workplaces, fields, movies, or stores.
People can follow ways to stay away from the community by staying home, reducing the journey, not going to a large area, greeting each other without touching, and maintaining distances from other people.
Many governments have now ordered or proposed not to interfere with people in areas affected by the outbreak of disease.
The size of the collection of people proposed by US government agencies and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 people (with no COVID-19 in some area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned a public collection of more than two people. Old and lw people with health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, blood pressure, and the affected body immune system have a high risk of serious illness and problems and have been advised by CDC to stay home as often as possible in the part of the outbreak of disease in society. Towards the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to change the word "not to be confused with people" and "keep away from people", to describe that the goal is to reduce contact directly while maintaining a social relationship, or a social relationship.
The use of the word "the far-off of society" has caused the franchise that people should be involved in a perfect social isolation, rather than urging them to continue contact with others through an alternative way. Some authorities have provided sexual health guidelines for spending during a major disaster.
These include suggestions only to deal with the person you live with, who has no virus or viral symptoms.
The isolation-based home has been proposed for those found by COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have provided detailed instructions for isolation-based home properly. Many governments have ordered or proposed a karant of people living in affected areas.
The strict instructions on the installation of katini are given to those in groups in high risk.
Those who may have had someone who has had COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or area with large distribution have been advised to put up a kaanti for 14 days from the time of the end may have had an infected one.
The process in the control of the outbreak of illness is to prevent increasing or suppressing, and avoiding each other.
Control is operated in the early phase of the rebound and aims to track and exclude infected people and bring other measures to control infection and vaccines to end the spread of other people.
If it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease , effort is then transferred to the avoid phase: measures are taken to reduce the spread and avoid its impact on the health and social health system.
A combination of measures to prevent increasing and avoiding each other can be done together.
Oppression calls for a difficult step to change a major disaster by reducing the number of production to be less than 1. The part of coping with infection is trying to reduce the peak of the explosion, known as balancing the outbreak of the disaster.
This reduces the risk of health care to be overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatment.
The non-competitive process that can control this rebound include personal prevention measures such as washing hands, wearing face-to-faces and placing themselves on the katani; the community's measures aimed at staying away socially such as the school closed and the disruption of the mass events to meet publicly; community's involvements to encourage acceptance and participate in such strategies; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning areas. The most strict action aimed at controlling the rebounds were taken in China only the edge of the rebound was clear, such as putting the entire city in the katini and putting a solid ban on transport.
Other countries have also implemented various measures aimed at reducing the spread of viruses.
South Korea introduced a public testing by regional katantis, and provided caution for the transport of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected with those who have put themselves in the katini and charged a large fine for those who failed to do so.
Taiwan added the production of the surface-story and fined for the adoption of medical products.
Better prevention policies can reduce the demand for medical services during the explosion for 2/3 and half deaths, but still cause hundreds of thousands and health systems to be overwhelmed.
Oppression is favored but needs to be maintained all the time the virus is increasingly widespread in the population (or until the vaccine is available, that comes first), or distributed either again quickly when the action is re-existed.
Long-term repression of disaster causes social and economic costs.
There is no licensed antivirus drug for COVID-19, but the effort to create them continues, as well as testing for existing drugs.
Using drugs purchased without a doctor’s instructions, drinking water, and rest can help reduce symptoms.
According to severity, air - extension therapy, dripu, and respiratory assistance may be needed.
The use of muscle - building drugs is able to develop results.
Several chemicals previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use to treat COVID-19.
WHO also noted that "some local and home-based solutions" can provide improvement to symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Adding space and changing health care to COVID-19 patients' needs is described by WHO as a primary step in coping with the outbreak of illness.
ECDC and the WHO European area office have provided hospital and primary health care guidelines to direct resources in several levels, as well as directing lab services by measuring COVID-19, cancelling planned procedures when possible, staying away from separating patients with COVID-19, increasing the capacity of high-profile care services by teaching workers and increasing the number of equipment to help breathing and beds.
There are many theories about the first episode (known as the first patient) may have appeared.
The first known case of the new korona virus can be traced to 1 December 2019 Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of korona Hubei virus cases gradually increased.
These were associated with the Total Fish Market Huanan, which also sold living animals, and one theory is that viruses came through one of these species; or, in other ways, has a source of animal to humans. The groups of pneumonia whose source was unknown was identified on 26 December and treated by physician Zhang Jixian at Hubei County Hospital, who introduced the CDC in Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned of "a korona virus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, along with Li Wenlang, drank by police by spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reproved by his superiors by giving warnings.
Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later married public note on 31 December and informed WHO.
The sufficient cases of unknown pneumonia had been reported to health authorities Wuhan to cause investigation into the beginning of January. In the early stages of the explosion, the number of cases doubled about seven and a half days.

Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when giving help to allies in the United States, [Putin] thinks that when American equipment manufacturers and medical tools get fast, they will also be able to help later if needed."
The " 2020" military operation of NATO Germany, Poland, and Baltic nations, NATO's largest war situation since the end of the Cold War, will be done at a reduced rate.
The Secretary General of the Football Campaign of the Nuclear War Kate Hudson blamed the operation of 2020: "In the current state of public health, it threatens not only the lives of the military from the United States and several European countries involved but also the country's rugbys where they perform operations." The Iranian government has been heavily affected by viruses, and about twenty-four MPs are infected with politicians and five present or temporary.
Iranian President Hassan Rousseau wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying that his country is working to face a rebound due to not reaching international markets following American stumbling against Iran. The explosion has caused a call to the United States to take social policies that are common in other wealthy countries, including public health care, child care, a paid family vacation, and high standards of public health funding.
Political critics expected it may adversely affect Donald Trump's possibility to be re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. The diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea were worse due to this tragedy.
South Korea denounced Japan's efforts "not well understood and not dealing with the katanti" after Japan announced everyone from South Korea will be placed in the katanti for two weeks in government stations.
The South Korean community was split initially with the response of President Moon Jae-in to a state of emergency.
Many Koreans signed applications that wanted the removal of Moon on the government's claims not to deal well with the rebound, or to praise its reaction. This story has allowed the country to pass emergency laws by response.
Other broadcasters have commented that it would allow the government to strengthen their leadership in power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to lead legally indefinitely, to establish parliament with elections and punish those who appeared to spread false information about viruses and government administration in a state of emergency.
The korona virus outbreak has been blamed for several incidents of lack of products,
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave the manifesto about the shortage of medicine and medical equipment due to increased need from users and the disruption of product distribution.
Many areas also witnessed people in fear of buying something that caused stores to miss important products such as food, sheet sheet and bottlewater and raised a shortage of product distribution.
The technology database has especially been cautious about the delay of the transfer of electronic products.
According to WHO's executive director Tedros Adharno, the need for personal protection equipment has increased 100 times.
This album has caused a rise in prices to twenty times of normal price and also caused delay in medical equipment for between four and six months.
It has also caused a lack of personal protection facilities in the world, and WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.
In Australia, this major disaster offered new opportunities for export dealers to sell goods from Australia in China.
The operation has caused a shortage of children's food in some supermarkets and was therefore banned by the Australian government.Despite the widespread spread of COVID-19 cases in North Italy and Wuhan, and continued the demand for food products, the two parts have been raised in large food shortages.
The measures of China and Italy against the adoption and illegal trade of essential products have been successful, preventing the severe lack of food expected in Europe and North America as well.
North Italy and its large production of agricultural products has not suffered a significant shortage, but the price may rise according to industrial representatives.
The lack of food at the store was only temporarily witnessed, even in Wuhan, with Chinese Government officials offering pork reserves to assure people of adequate food.
Such laws are also available in Italy that require food producers to save for such an emergency.
The destruction of the international economy has had a negative impact in China: according to a press report on 16 March, China's economy was affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the government to reduce the spread of viruses and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since the Chinese continent is a major economic and industrial center, the outbreak of this virus has been seen to cause a significant impact on international economicization.
Agathe Demarais from the Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that the market will remain unstable until the most obvious picture should be raised about possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic collapse due to this major disaster in international growth can pass the result of the 2002–2004 SARS.
Some estimates from Washington University at St. Louis gave the impact of more than $300+ billion on global product distribution that would last up to two years.

The main banks are dealing faster than they dealt with during the 2008 financial decline.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors by travel restrictions, the closure of public areas including transportation attractions, and government advice against transport around the world.
As a result, many airlines have interrupted flights due to low need, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, with the British Flybe regional organization falling.
The effect in the luxury ship sector was at a level that has not previously been seen.
The train station and the ferry port are also closed.
This tragedy coincided with Chunyun, an important travel season associated with the Chinese New Year's holiday.
Many of the events involving many people were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festival, and a private company also closing their own stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Chinese New Year events and tourist attractions are closed to prevent a mass collection, including Forbidden City Beijing and natural exhibitions in the temple.
In 24th China's 31 provinces, mnispa and territories, authorities increased the New Year's vacation to 10 February, and ordered many jobs not to open until that day.
These areas represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of foreign sales.
Hong Kong increased the reaction of infectious diseases to the highest and broadcast emergency, and shut down school to March and cancel the New Year's ceremony.The retail business industry has been affected internationally, and the transfer of hours of work or temporary closure.
Visits to European and Latin American dealers fell by 40%.
North and Middle American dealers saw a 50–60% shortage.
This also caused a 33–43% shortage on foot to large stores in March compared to February.
The world's largest store operators set further steps, such as increasing sanitation, placing heat-season devices to measure the temperature of consumers, and cancelling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission to the Latin American estimate, the recession following disaster may leave people between 14 to 22 million more in extreme Latin poverty than it would be in the situation without disaster.
In January and February 2020, when the disaster was more intense Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs.
Many of 300 million workers who moved from the countryside have been trapped at home in provinces in the country or prevented from Hubei province. In March 2020, over 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for government assistance.
The outbreak of the korona virus may lead to the dismissal of 47 million people in the United States and the unemployment rate may reach 32%, according to estimates by the St. Lois Bank. The closure of regular operations in the Uhindi has caused a million workers who moved to the Uhindi (paid through daily income) without work. Research from the Angus Reid Institute became 44% of Canada's homes were affected by a different type of unemployment.Takriban employees lost their jobs in Spain since it began to be closed for regular operations in mid-final 2020.
In the second phase of March, 4 million French workers applied for the benefits of unemployment and 1 million British employees sent applications for a loan plan for all.Takriban a half million companies in Germany have sent their employees into a program funded by a short-term government known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work program has also been used by France and England.
The artal and traditional turaths are very critical and this major disaster, having affected the performance of organizations and individuals—employed and employed—of nations.
Organizations in the art and cultural sectors tried to endorse their goal (which are usually funded by the public) to provide the ability to reach cultural turaths to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public and help the possible artists.
By March 2020, around the world and in different levels, museums, libraries, theater, and other cultural institutions had been closed indefinitely by their shows, events and performances were cancelled or suspended.
With response there was a lot of effort to provide alternative services through online platforms. Another recent fast-growing event due to this disease is the dismissal of religious worship, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music and exhibitions, technology conference, and fashion shows.
The film album has also experienced confusion. Vatican announced that the anniversary of the Great Week Rome, which is in the last week of the Christian season to repent of Lent, have been cancelled.

Following the Roman Catholic diocese to close their churches and small churches and the St. Peter's absence of Christian pilgrims, other religious organizations also canceled their worship and controlled the convention in churches, mosques, synagogue, temple and gurdwarras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the dismissal of Friday prayers in areas affected by the rebounds and shrines were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of guest pilgrims and civilians towards holy places Mecca and Medina.
This tragedy has caused the largest confusion in the world's sports calendar from the Second World War.
Many sports events have been cancelled or suspended, including the 2019–20 UEFA Championship League, the 2019–20 European Premier League, the 2020 European UEFA, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019–20 NHL season.
This explosion disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics, which had been planned to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the games "will be aired until another date after 2020 but not more than the 2021 summer season".Kasino and other sports stations in the world are closed by the live poker tournament either have been suspended or deleted.
This has caused many players to go online, and many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in the standards of subscribers.The entertainment system has also been affected, and many music groups to stop or cancel show trips.
The hall of many games like the Broadway also stopped the playoffs.
Other artists have tried ways to continue to create and distribute work via the web as an alternative method of live shows, such as live online shows or create a "season" online of artists to entertain people, distribute, and promote their works.
Many comedy images with the content of the korona virus have spread to the public as many people turn to humor and the publicization even to be present in the state of the document.
Since COVID-19, the rise of uncaused hatred, discrimination from other countries, racism has been seen by people from China or Central Asia, and against people from the most affected parts of Europe, the United States and other countries.
The events of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially Europe, Central Asia, North America, and the Pacific region of Asia.
Reports from February (where most cases were still in China) have witnessed the feelings of racism being directed to different Chinese groups to qualify for a virus or receive what is claimed to be a proper punishment.
Other countries in Africa have seen feelings against the Chinese.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents have reported discrimination according to the area from.
There has been support of Chinese, online and external hands, and for those in viral areas.
Following the continuation of this rebound in other countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe through the severe COVID-19, they would also review a state of suspicion and fear against foreigners. The country of Malaysia, the Polish, Singapore and South Korea originally signed a argument to prevent China's people from entering their country in an effort to prevent this disease.
In Japan, the railway score #ChineseDontCome ToJapan blew on Twitter.
Chinese indigenous people and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported high rates of racial abuse, as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has been inspired by referring to the korona virus as "Chinese Russians", a statement considered by critics as racial and discrimination in China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian sons and visitors rescued from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the North East India, which uses one border with China and read in India's capital cities reported through the abuse related to the korona virus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata State Party unit in West Bengal mentioned the Chinese who had destroyed natural property and "that is why God decided to retaliate against them."
The comment was later condemned by the Chinese embassy Kolkata, citing it as "miss". In China, discrimination from other countries and racism against non-Chinese residents has increased following this tragedy, and visitors called "a strange wish" and targeted for "throwing".
Many registered newspapers have removed them from some or with all information about the korona virus.
Many scientific publishers wrote scientific papers related to the re-existing and free access capacity.
Other scientists decided to spread their results quickly in the automatic seva such as bioRxiv.

The ratings of asthma of the korona 2019 virus (COVID-19) and viruses related to SARS-CoV-2 including techniques that discover the presence of viruses and those that discover antibodi produced to fight infection.
The presence of viruses on a virus sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which discovers the RNA protein of the korona virus.
This rating is specific and designed to detect the RNA protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus alone.
It is used to confirm recent or ongoing transmissions.
The discovery of antibodi (serology) can be used in investigation as well as surveillance.
Antibodi measurements show the number of people who suffered illness including those whose symptoms were very low reported or those who showed no symptoms.
The correct rate of deaths caused by this disease and the level of strong body protection among people can be defined from this measurement.
Due to low testing rates, by March 2020 no countries had reliable data on the spread of viruses among its people.
By 23 March, no country had measured over 3% of its people, and there is a significant difference in the number of measurements made in various countries.
This situation of diversity also has the possibility of affecting the high mortality rate, which is more likely to be estimated in some countries.
Using a real-time (rRT-PCR) measure can be made on a sample of asthma found in various ways, including a sample of nose products or a sample of kohozi.
The overall results are found within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR ratings made using the throat samples are only expected in the first week of illness.
Later, viruses can be lost in the throat while continuing to breed in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternative sample equipment can be taken from the depth of respiratory methods through a body fluid or cough (hozi) can be used.
One of the original PCR measurements was created in Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using a real-time (rRT-PCR), and became the basis for 250,000 packages distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had also created a measure by 23 January 2020. South Korean Kogenebiotech , created a package to discover SARS-CoV-2 based on the PCR of medical status (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It seeks a "E" similar to all the beta virus, and the RdRp jini which is especially available in SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency permission from the National Management of the Medical Products in China for a package of SARS-CoV-2 to rely on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes its Real PCR Survey of Korna 2019virus (2019-CoV) for the public health of the International Health of the World.
One of the three electronic measurements in the original testing packages caused an unincorporated exit from evil testing instruments, and testing procedures at the CDC station in Atlanta; this caused the average number of 100 samples to be effectively measured in the entire February 2020.
Measures using the ingredients were not defined as reliable until 28 February 2020, it was until this time that the national and street romance was allowed to operate measurements.
The standard was approved by Food and Drug Management under the Management of Use in Emergency. Markani's commercial agents began to perform measurements in March 2020.
By 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the presence of COVID-19 in a nation using RT-PCR.
Quest Disagnosics also made COVID-19 measurements available by 9 March 2020.
No set of standards was announced; collection and sample cuts must be made according to CDC needs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 measure was created and produced by the National Centre for Vairology and Bayoteknology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020 the measure was registered by the Federal Medical Tracking Service.Tarehe 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to create a measure to discover COVID-19 .Tarehe 13 March 2020, Roche Dicrimics received approval from FDA for a measure that would be made within 3.5 hours for the top juzu, thus allowing one machine to do about 4,128 measurements for 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA released emergency-use approval (EUA) to Abbott Laboratorys with a measure of Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar approval for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the same EUA approval from FDA for a measure that takes about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a measure that uses nuclear acid production technology based on a solid temperature measure rather than PCR.
Because this measure does not require changing temperatures, this technique can provide positive results in a short minute of five minutes and negative releases in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 machines in the United States and Abbott expect to increase production to provide 50,000 measurements per day. The same antibobos of nucleocapsid protein (protin N) of new korona virus is formed in Taiwan, with the belief that it will produce results after 15 to 20 minutes as just a flu test.
The conclusion of the March 2020 article concluded that "the chest measurements are of low-profile value in the original phase, with the results of CT [a photo of the body's organs shown by computers] if it can be present even before the appearance of symptoms."
Common components on CT include two rock lines of rock-based rock lines that block the light with the side, parallel to the back.
The presence of Subpleural in abundance, the evil way and strengthening grow the disease going on to grow.
A study comparing PCR to CT at Wuhan during the emergence of the current major disaster has suggested that CT is much better than PCR, though not specific with its many photo components to interfere with other pneumonia and disease processes.
By March 2020, the U.S. Radioology College suggests that "CT should not be used to conduct an investigation or first phase of COVID-19". By March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR to be used in the original investigation.
The part of the body's defense to deal with the transmission is the production of antibodi including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect the infection within people from 7 days after the start of symptoms, detect the body's immunity, and surveillance. Tests can be made in the middle romance (CLT) or by testing in the care areas (PoCT).
The automatic body testing systems in many clinical information will be able to implement these tests but their access will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT a sample of side blood is used, although the sample zugu can be used to monitor the body's immune confrontation.
For PoCT, one sample of blood is usually available from skin pressure.
Unlike PCR's methods of taking is not necessary before the test.Tarehe 26 March, 2020, FDA named 29 organizations that reported to the organization is necessary and so they are currently able to distribute their antibodi measurements.
By 7 April 2020, one attempt alone has been approved by FDA under the endorsement of emergency use.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Disamics and Epitope Disamics received the European extension of their packages, which can detect IgG and ICA against viruses on a blood sample.
The testing capacity is hundreds of samples within the clock and thus is faster than the standard PCR test of the virus RNA.
Antibodi can normally be discovered 14 days after the start of the release. Mapema April, England found that there was no antibodi package that bought to be better used.
Hong Kong has set up a plan where suspected people may stay at home, "the emergency will give the patient a sample bottle", he will spit into it, restore it and get the results of measurement in time.NHS of the United Kingdom has announced that it makes attempts to measure people suspected of being sick at home, which removes the risk of the patient coming to the hospital or forced to kill germs on the ambulance if used by the patient. In COVID-19 for suspected cases, a health expert takes samples with proper precautions.
The car-based stations have helped South Korea to implement some of the fastest and highest measurements of any country.There are Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Doctors said on 2 March, that it had a rate of about 12,000 per day in the ambulance and 10.,700 had been measured last week.
The cost is funded by health insurance when the measure is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 per week.
By 19 March the traffic ratings were made in several major cities.
By 26 March 2020 the total number of measurements carried out in Germany was unknown, because the results of the only victims were reported.
The first laboratory research showed that by the week of 12/2020 calendars total of at least 483,95 samples were measured to and including 12/2020 weeks and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2.Hiko Israel, researchers at Technion Hospital and Rambam developed and tried a method of measuring samples from 64 patients at one time, by putting together samples and measuring more if a sample mix is available to be affected.Hiko Wuhan lab of emergency discovery created by 2000 square meters called "Ho-Yan" (Ki: ›, or "FI) in February 2020, and the year of the year, and the year of the year of the year of the year, and the year of the year of the year of the year, and the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year, and the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year, and the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year, "FIO]
And if the construction is managed by the founder of BGI Wang Jian and completed in 5 days, estimates have shown the cases Hubei would be 47% more and the combined cost of facing the katanti would double if this measurement rate would not be established.
Wuhan Laboratory has been quickly followed by the Hub-Yan lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
By 4 March 2020 a total of daily possibilities were 50,000 daily measurements. The different free-season units provided by Origami Assays have been released and have the capacity to measure the amount of 1122 COVID19 patients using only 93 measurements . These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without needing the use of robots to handle water.
By March, poor shortages and standards of measurement tools have been a challenge to the public testing of the EU and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has caused publishers to investigate the production processes of sample involving heat samples in 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genome for further measurements.Tarehe 31 March was announced that the United Arab Empire was now measuring more people to the koronavirus than any other country, and was running to increase testing rates to reach the highest population.
This was through the inclusion of the ability to serve when people were with the purchase of romance to measure a large number of people from Group 42 and BGI (according to their "Huo-Yan emergency discovery" in China).
Built within 14 days, this romance has the ability to make thousands of RT-PCR measurements daily and is the first world with such potential to be used outside China.
Various testing units aimed at various aspects of the koronavirus process were formed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The Health Organization began using German resipe to produce packages sent to low-income nations with the ability to create their own.
The German response was published on 17 January 2020; the consensus produced by the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases was not available until 28 January, and delaying existing measurements in the United States.Uchina and the United States had problems and efficiency of the pre-existing, and these countries and Australia could not provide adequate equipment according to the needs and recommendations for testing by health experts.
In comparison, experts say that access to testing in many areas of South Korea helped reduce the spread of new korona virus.
The ability to measure, the main in the love of the private sector, was built over a long period of time by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for a jersey for testing plans as a means to reduce the spread of the massive COVID-19.The top rating package from the spread of many viruses caused hundreds of thousands of measurements in private romance in the United States, and there was a shortage in the distribution of the chemical testing.
In March 2020 China reported problems in the accuracy of testing packages.
In the United States, the testing packages created by the CDC had "free;" the government then removed restrictions that prevented personal testing . Spain purchased testing packages from China's Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of measurement were incorrect.
The organization explained that these incorrect results can result from failing to collect samples or not using packages accordingly.
The Spanish ministry said that it would remove packages that restored incorrect results, and would use packages offered by Shenzhen Bioeasy instead.80% of the testing packages that the Czech Republic purchased from China provided incorrect results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million packages from China that were found to not produce correct results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the items on the Danube River.Ateş Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the testing packages that Turkey purchased from China had "high level of error" and "not used them." The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million packages from China but in early April 2020 announced that they were not used.
Surveying, being picked up by the katanti of those tested and found by illness and followed by those who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2, occurred in the results of infection.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Vō, the first episode of death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two stages of measurement for a total of 3,400 people, about ten days.
About half of the people diagnosed with illness had no symptoms and all discovered cases were placed in the katanti.
With travel controlled, this completely removed new transmission.
With a strong track program, internal transport restrictions, testing and katanti, the 2020 korona virus crisis in Singapore has spread a slower than other developed nations, but without restrictions of the worst conditions such as forcing the closing of restaurants and retail stores.
Many events have been interrupted by Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools were reopened for the right time after vacation on 23 March.
Many other countries have also controlled this major disaster for a strong track plan to track people who have touched each other, travel restrictions within the country, testing and katanti, but at a low rate of closing regular operations, such as Aisland and South Korea.
Digital research has shown that nations that have measured more, compared to the death toll, have low levels of cases, perhaps because of these nations being able to detect those with moderate symptoms or without symptoms.
WHO recommends that the helpless nations to measure and a national romance with low experience on COVID-19 send the first five cases of the availability of illness and the first ten samples without COVID-19 in one of the 16th WHO romances for the testing of evidence.
Between the romances involved 16, 7 is in Asia, 5 is in Europe, 2 Africa, 1 North America and 1 Australia.
On the following chart, the vertical column of "The disease as % of measurement" is inspired by the testing policy.
The country that measures the hospital alone will have a high number of cases of illness as % of measurements than the country that measures all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other factors equal.
Washing hands (or wash hands), where it is also known as the purity of hands, is an act of cleaning hands for the purpose of removing sand, dirt, germs or other non-competitive objects.
Washing hands with soap every time in "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example driving with cholera, which is distributed through the way of feces to reach the mouth.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or normal fever, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. liquid membranes).
Five important times during the day when washing the hand with soap is important include: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's toilet or changing the diaper, before giving the baby food, before eating and before and after providing food or touching raw meat, fish or chickens.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after serving the patient.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the baby who has gone to the toilet.
After scraping scissors, coughing or sneezing.
After holding an animal, animal food, or animal feces.
The hygiene of medical hands refers to cleaning activities related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medication or treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of illness.
The main goal of washing hands is to clean hands from viruses (bacteria, viruses, or other germs can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people dealing with food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important act for the public in general.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, koronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes by driving; reducing infectious diseases; reducing infectious diseases;
and reduce infant mortality during home delivery.
Research conducted 2013 showed that improving handwashing actions can lead to limited improvement in children’s height under the age of five.
In developing nations, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and driving can be prevented by introducing changes in simple behaviors, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple act can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
The process that urges people to wash hands can reduce operating sessions for about a third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of the decline in operating sessions can be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is one of the most practical ways of preventing operating and respiratory disease (AR), as a common conduct followed at home, school and society around the world.
Nimonia, the main type of RAR, is the number of deaths of children under five years, and killed about 1.8 million children each year.
The joint driving and pneumonia contribute to the deaths of 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making the washing of hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet as practices can save more lives than any vaccine or medical strategy, reducing deaths from nearly half and deaths from asthma to a quarter.
Washing hands is usually included with other cleaning strategies as part of the water, cleaning plans and satisfaction (OSHA).
Washing hands also prevents rash disease that is distributed through direct contact with the body.
A small effect on washing hands is that washing hands can always cause damage to skin damage from the drying of illness.
Research in the 2012 Denmaki showed that excessive washing may lead to the condition of skin irritation known as handwashing or skin disease of the common conditions especially among medical personnel.
Washing hands is also often seen as one of the symptoms of thought or overreview (OCD).
There are five important times a day when washing hands with soap is necessary to reduce the distribution of diseases from the feces to the mouth: after using the toilet (to go a small need, go a great need), after cleaning the fire (changes its diapers), before giving him food, before eating and before/after providing food or touching raw meat, fish or breeding aircraft.
Other events where the correct method of washing should be done to prevent the distribution of the disease include before and after treating injury; after sneezing, coughing or giving the scissors; after touching the dirt of animals or dealing with them; after touching waste.
In many countries, there is a low amount of washing hands with soap.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 recognized that on average, 38.7% of the house were washing their hands with soap. 2014 research showed that Saudi Arabia had a higher rate of 97 percent; the United States near the middle and 77%; and China and the lowest rate of 23 percent of the house were washing their hands with soap in these critical times. The washing of the school children in the scheduled hours is one of the techniques in developing countries to teach and remind children of their hands to wash their hands.
"The Basic Health Service" implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is a model of high-profile development of children's health and education.
Kill the worms twice a year, added and washing hands daily with soap, brushing daily with fluorini, is the basis for this national project.
It has also been successful in Indonesia.
The removal of germs from the skin has been enabled by adding soap or severe water cleaning.
An important act of soap and severe medicine is to reduce the barriers of the mixture, and increase the fluid.
Water alone is not capable of cleaning the skin because oil and proteins, which are organic materials, are not easily fed in water.
Cleaning, however, is helped by a good flow of water.
Sots, for its re-use, can put bacteria available from the original use.
A few research numbers that have dealt with bacterial distribution from contaminated soaps have concluded that distribution is not easy to occur because bacteria are washed and removed through form.
The CDC still mentions that "an uncontrolled water design in its spill is proposed".
The bacteria that kill bacteria have been widely broadcast to a healthy public.
To this day, there is no evidence that using proposed antiseptic or parasites select non-defeated organisms in nature.
However, bacteria that kill bacteria have common products that combat bacteria such as triclosan, which contains a long list of immortal species.
So, even if immortal species have not been released from soap against bacteria, they may not work effectively as they are announced.
Apart from the skin protection drug, the combination of the combination may have acid (astrotic acid, acid askokiki, milk acid, a fermented milk acid) as an pH control, acid fighting benzoic and other leather-speeds (aloe vera, vitamins, mentha, medicine from trees). An analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that conventional soap is only as suitable as those of users to combat bacteria with tricosan in preventing the bacteria from disease and removing the bacteria from the bacteria.
Hot water that is all right to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster in body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot water, soapy is more suitable than cold water with sapu in removing natural oil that holds sand and bacteria.
Contrary to popular beliefs however, scientific studies have shown that using water movement has no effect on reducing the dirt of the liver.
The hand-speed or antiseptic is a non-water cleaning drug.
In the late 1990s and early 21st decade, a liquid of water-free hands (which is also known as alcohol-based chips, antiseptic or handprints.) began to be popular.
Many have the isopropyl or ethanol alcohol was mixed with weight-reference organs such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) and create oil, or a moisture supplement such as making glyrin into liquid, or foam to be used quickly and reduce the effects of alcohol fluid.
Adding the molten Hydrogen perok assister increases the counter-specific activity. Hand chips with at least 60 to 95% of alcohol are suitable for the killing of germs.
Alcohol - containing alcohol is contaminated with bacteria, non-regulated bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, light, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
The alcohol-based liquids by 70% are 99.97% (a sample of 3.5 log, similar to 35 decibels) of bacteria 30 seconds after using them with 99.99% to 99.999% (a number of log 4 to 5) of bacteria in hand 1 minutes after using them. The hands are more suitable against bacteria and are less suitable against a virus.
The alcohol-based handprints are almost entirely inappropriate against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), which are the most common causes of gastroenteritisi. A sufficient or alcohol-based drug must be used properly to supply the liquid or cover all hands.
The front and back of all hands and in the middle and the tips of all the fingers are rubbed for at least 30 seconds to liquid, foam or tats dry.
The tips of the fingers must also be washed well, by rubbing them on all the hands. The Center for Control and Prevention of American Diseases recommends washing hands than using the chips, especially when it is clear that hands are dirty.
The increased use of these liquids is due to its use and the fast-season operation, however, he should not be used as a method of washing hands unless soap and water are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based chips can cause the drying of skin except the pholinent organs and/or skin softened organs have been added to the form.
The alcohol effect of skin drying can be reduced or removed by adding glyrin and/or other emolinnet organs on the form.
In the clinical experiments, alcohol-based liquids caused a low level of irritation and skin drying compared to other germs.
The problems of allergic reactions to skin touch, skin gum disease or alcohol-related problems or alcohol - related ingredients or alcohol - related ingredients did not occur significantly.
The lower ability to cause skin burns turned into a charm compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, non-water products do not wash their hands from the organic materials, but it is contaminated by them.
It is due to this reason that handprints are less suitable as soap and water in preventing the spread of germs because the germs still remain on the hands.
The non-drinking prosperity depends largely on its organs and cells, and historically has not done well compared to those with alcohol.
More recently, the combination that uses the benzalkonium chloroid has been shown to have a solid and general operation against germs after being used, compared to alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in its efficiency after being used for a while, perhaps due to continuing to cause serious skin problems.
Many people from low income communities cannot afford the prices of soap and use ash or sand instead.
The ash or sand can be more suitable than water alone but cannot be more effective than soap.
One concern is that if sand or ash has germs, it can exceed the impact instead of reducing its spread.
Like soap, ash is also a product of germs because it is mixed with water, it produces a mixture of alcalin.
WHO recommends ash or sand as alternative soap products when soap is not available.
The technique of washing hands in a correct way proposed by the U.S. Centers for the development of the spread of disease include the following steps:
Use water to wash your hands or cold water.
The flowing water is recommended because the ben can be contaminated, although water temperature does not seem to be different.
Take the hands with a sufficient amount of soap, including the back parts of the hands, in the middle of the fingers and even under the claws.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that people have the habit of washing their hands better using soap than only water.
Share it for at least 20 seconds.
It causes friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin and rub longer eliminates even more germs.
Share it well with the water that flows.
Selling on the beshen can again pollute hands.
Wash water with a clean towel or allow it to dry in the air.
Hands that have liquids and moisture can easily be rough again. The parts that are often forgotten are the thumb, a hand ankle, the areas between the fingers and under the claws.
False claws and hand - painting paints are putting germs.
Skin softening oil is repeatedly recommended to help the hands from dry; dry skin can cause damage to skin damage that can cause an increase in the risk of spread.
Low-season options can be made to enable washing hands in the canal water and/or soap is not available for example pouring water from a bulb with suitable holes and/or using ash required in nations continues. In a situation where there is no sufficient water (such as schools and stem areas in developing nations), there are solutions to store water, such as "care channels" and other low-season options.
The hanging canal is a simple technology that uses a rope-based pitcher and a foot-rund to pour a little water in hand and on a piece soap.
Proper handwashing is an important part of the handwashing process, but the debate continues about the most appropriate ways to pull hands in public bath areas.
A large growing study suggests that paper towels is a cleaner way than the electric hands in many bathrooms.
In 2008, research was conducted by Westminster University, London, and funded by the sector of the towels of the European Papers Show, to compare the standards of cleanliness provided by paper towels, airwashers and the most modern air-air air-air air-air.
After washing and drying hands with hand drying the air, the total number of bacteria was found to increase average on the fingers by 194% in the palm by 254%.
The drying of the jersey-air spray caused an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the fingers by 42% and on the hands by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with tissue, the total number of bacteria decreased on the fingers by 76% and the palm to 77%. The scientists also experimented to determine whether there was a possibility of pollution of other bathroom users and bathroom environments due to every type of hand drying method.
The drying machine, which gives the unit air at a speed claimed to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow germs from the hands and unit and the possibility of polluting other bathroom users and bathroom environments to 2 m.
The use of the air - drying air hands spreads germs to a distance of 0.25 m from the machine.
Tishu did not show too much germs.In 2005, a study by T&V Produk und Umelt, different hand drying techniques were assessed.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after drying hands were witnessed:
There are many manufacturers of water - drying products, and these hand drying products have been compared to using tissue.
Washing hands with liquid arm tissue is an alternative way when you travel and no soap and water.
The liquid of hand germs is suitable for at least 60% of alcohol.
Washing medical hands became necessary long after a specialist from Hungary, Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its success (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices used to provide answers to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study has been reduced by the rates of infection due to its use.
Washing hands is recommended to be for 15 seconds to be treated, using a sufficient amount of soap and water or oil to rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together by tying the fingers.
If there is a waste under the claws, a soft brush can be used to remove it.
Because germs can pray in hand water, it is important to sell good and dry hands with clean towel.
After wiping it, these tissues are suitable to be used to close water (and open any exit door if required).
This prevents the transmission of hands from these places.
The motive for washing hands in the health care section is to remove disease germs ("scream") and prevent distribution.
The New England reports that lack of handwash remains in unacceptable standards in many medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching the sick and thus distributing germs.
One study showed that the proper washing of hands and other simple processes can reduce the amount of blood transmission related to katheta for 66. The World Health Organization publishes a jersey that shows conventional washing and rubbing hands in the medical sectors.
The organization's cleaning guide can also be found on the organization's website in public opinion.
A related study was conducted by Whitby and other authors.
Commercial equipment can measure and confirm the purity of hands, if law enforcement shows are needed.
The World Health Organization has "Five Times" to wash hands:
after being in the possibility of touching blood/the body's blood
before the role that can infect bacteria, and
after serving the patient. The addition of bacterial killer chemicals to soap (the "drug" or "with killer-viin") enables products used to wash hands to kill bacteria.
Such an act of killing bacteria may be required before performing surgery or in a scene in which germs are resistant to anti-regulated drugs and kill bacteria are in abundance. In order to 'scream' your hands with surgery, it is necessary to have a canal that can be opened and closed without holding it with hands, the amount of chloroexin or a religious solution, towels that were executed to wipe hands after washing, and a brush that was executed to rub and another device that was executed on cleaning parasites under the claws.
All jewelry is suitable for release.
This process requires washing hands and handwashing to the elbow, usually for 2–6 minutes.
Long-term (d. 10 minutes) is not required.
When you sell it, the handback must be blocked to flow back and return by hand.
After the washing of hands is completed, the hands are pulled out of a cloth executed parasites and surgical gas.
To reduce the distribution of germs, it is good to wash hands or use a baktria chemical before and after serving the patient.
With control of bacterial transmissions in the hospital, it has been discovered that the greatest advantage from washing hands occurred in the first 20% of the washing, and that poor profit was found when the washing rate was added over 35%.
The washing of soap alone causes more than three times more than three times the amount of disease infected by food - spread bacteria compared to washing and soap containing bacteria, compared to rubbing hands using a mixture containing alcohol and washing hands with soap containing bacteria for an average of 30 seconds showed that rubbing hands with a mixture containing alcohol reduced bacterial infection by 26% more than a chemical chemicalicide.
But soap and water are more suitable than a mixture of rubbing hands with alcohol by reducing H1N1 A flu virus and Clostridium difficile cells from hands. The strategy to improve hand hygiene in the health care scene may involve working education about washing hands, increasing the availability of a mixture of alcohol - contaminated rubbing, and the museum written and said to the staff.
There is a need for more research in which of these strategies is effective in a different scene of health care.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a low-season device, essential in good health, and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, handwashing equipment or soap in people’s homes, schools and workplaces are a challenge in achieving the world’s washing habits.
For example, most of our villages in Africa the washing areas near every private or public toilet are few, even though cheap methods are available to build handwash stations.
However, low handwash rates may also be the result of practicing behavior but not because of the lack of soap or water.
The development and defense of handwashing with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of washing hands and causing changes in long-term behavior.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and assessment are important.
A study of 70 studies found that the social-related techniques are appropriate in increasing handwashing in LMIC, with campaigns to encourage society to change behavior appropriate to a low level. One of the production of handwashing in school is UNICEF's "The Third Star" of UNICEF urging schools to take simple, low-season measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other cleaning needs.
When low levels have been accomplished, schools can move from one star to the end of three stars.
Building handwash stations can be part of the campaign to develop hands that are continued to reduce child disease and deaths.
The Day of Washing Earth's Hands is another example of a campaign to increase awareness that tries to bring about climate change. Due to the 2019–20 korona virus crisis, UNICEF improved the use of handwashing.
A small number of studies have focused on the cost of the total washing of hands in developing countries in connection with DALY measure.
However, one study recommends that encouraging washing with soap is cheaper than other water strategies and sanitation.
The importance of washing hands for human health - especially for people in a state of danger such as the mother who have given birth or soldiers who suffered injuries in the hospital - was first discovered in the mid-century and two predecessors of hand hygiene: a doctor from Hungary named Ignaz Semmelweis aabye worked in Vienna, Australia and Florence Nightingale, English "the founder of modern nursing".
At that time many people still believed that the infection was caused by a bad odor known as a hundredmas.
In 1980, the leaks caused through food and exposure related to health services made the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of American Diseases to promote perfect hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of influenza in 2009 and COVID-19 disaster in 2020 threatened to increase awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from similar infection.
For example, banners written "right handwashing techniques" were written near handwashing in public toilets and in office toilets and airports in Germany.
The passage "wash your hands from" something, means declaring to a person not wanting to take responsibility for something or join others in an illegal or ethical matter.
It comes from the phrase of the mistress at Matthew where Pilate washed his hands from the decision to settle Jesus Christ, but it has been a major passage in some of the British communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Daughter Macbeth begins to wash her hands with a compulsion to try to clean the supposed spot, pointing to a guilty conscience about the crime she committed and persuaded her husband to act.
It has also been discovered as people, after remembering or meditating on immoral acts, seems to wash more hands than others, and seem to appreciate more handwashing equipment.
Furthermore, those who are accepted to wash their hands after meditating on such things are less likely to engage in other acts of paying for "defense", such as self-dependent.
Religion orders to wash hands because of cleanliness and as signs. Washing hands as signs, washing hands with water without soap, is part of the washing of hands in many religions, including Bahá'í'í's Faith , Hinduism, tevilah and netlat ofdayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.Dini also orders to wash hands with purity, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam order to wash hands after using the toilet.
And, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam order to wash hands before and every meal.
Risk control of COVID-19
The risk control of COVID-19 is the use of safety techniques in the workplace and health of risk control in preventing the korona 2019 virus (COVID-19).
Proper risk control at work corresponds to part of the work and work implemented, the following assessment of the risk of the source of the source was at risk, the rate of illness in society, and the risk factors of workers who may be infected with COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Labor and Health Safety Administration (OSHA), the work of a few are at risk is limited to working people and the public and other employees, and the primary measures to prevent the transmission are recommended, including washing hands, urging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing manners, and maintaining the cleanliness of the order and cleaning of the working scene.
The functions of the average risk include those that need to be frequent or around people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but it is possible to be infected from the ongoing distribution of society or international transportation.
This includes workers who engage in general public as well as in school, a work scene with a population, and several areas of the most populous retail business.
Dangerous controls for this group, more than the basic measures to prevent the transmission, include ventilation using a high-profile air filter, sneezing restrictions, and having personal protection equipment available if someone with COVID-19 is available.
OHA considers health workers and conservation rooms to be at risk by known or suspected of having COVID-19 to be at high risk of being at risk, which is increasing to be more at risk if workers perform processes that provide erosoli in, or collect and handle models, known or suspected from someone with COVID-19.
The control of appropriate risks these employees includes engineering control such as low-air rooms and environments, and proper personal protection equipment done.
COVID-19 outbreaks may have a lot of harm in the workplace.
Workers can be unemployed from becoming sick, need to care for others, or in fear of being at risk.
Commercial styles are able to change, in the type of products needed, and the methods of obtaining the products (such as buying goods at times when there are no people or through delivery or via service as a car).
Finally, the transport of goods from badly affected areas by COVID-19 can be interrupted. The preparation plans and response to infection may be used to lead the protection measures.
Plans deal with risk rates related to parts of work different from the work done, including reasons for risk, the potential impact of domestic and social areas, and the risk of private workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also list appropriate controls to cope with these risks, and emergency plans for conditions that may arise following the rebound.
Preparations for infectious diseases and response plans are able to follow national or local proposals.
The objectives of response to the re-election include reducing distribution between workers, protecting people who are more at risk for chronic medical problems, maintaining business operations, and reducing the negative impact on other organizations and involved in transporting goods.
The severity of illness in society where business is affecting the reaction taken.
The system of risk control rates is a system widely used in working security and health to place in risk control groups according to efficiency.
Where COVID-19 risks cannot be stopped, the best control is engineering, followed by administrative control, and the end of personal protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating workers from working risks without relying on working habits, and can be cheap solutions to implement.
The control of the administration is a change in working policies or procedures that require action by the worker or the rugby.
Personal defense devices (PPE) are considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative control, but are able to prevent some of the events of risk.
All types of PPE must be selected according to danger to the worker, and well worn properly (k.m., respiratory aid machines), each time and well worn, regular inspection, maintenance, and replaced, required, and removed well, cleaned, and placed or thrown away.
According to the U.S. Labor and Health Safety Administration, the work of a few are at risk are in conflict with working people and the public and other employees.
The basic measures to prevent proposed transmissions for all working scenes include washing occasionally and well, urging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing manners including covering cough and sneezing, releasing tissue and trash barrels, preparing for working from home or working on shifts as needed, advising workers not to use the equipment of others, and maintain the cleaning of coordination and cleaning with a working scene.
The quick discovery and isolation of people who are estimated to have an attack is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the work section.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with symptoms of chronic respiratory disease are fit to stay at home until they are less hot, signs of high temperatures, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of drugs to reduce the temperature or cope with symptoms, and that the vacation policies of the disease are changing according to circumstances, allowing workers to stay at home to serve a family member who is ill, and that workers know these policies.
According to OSH, the work of being at risk to average includes those that need to interact with people from time to time or be around people between six feet (1.8 m) who are not known or suspected of COVID-19 patients, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing social distribution near the business area, or because the person has recently traveled internationally to a large area of COVID-19.
This includes employees who are in general as in schools, a scene of work with many people, and other areas of business re-influences with many people. The engineering controls for this and the most likely groups of infection include putting high-profile air filters, increasing air traffic rates, setting restrictions such as the clear restrictions of sneeze, and put a window through the drive by the service of customers. The control of the administration to this group and other endangered ones are including encouraging patients to stay at home, to change the face-to-face meetings and communication through the means of the use of the use of the work, to establish a shift in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the use of the system, including the use of the public, and the use of the public's facilities, including the use of the home, changing the home-to-face meetings and communication, starting a shift to the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the Internet, including the use of the public, and the use of the public domain, including the use of the public domain, and the use of the public domain, including the use of the home, changing the face-to-faces, to establish a shift in the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the use of the home, and the use of the public's own devices, including the use of the public domain, and the use of the public domain of the system, including the use of the public domain, and the use of the public domain, including the use of the home of the home, changing the surface meetings with the means of the use of the Internet, and the use of the public domain, and the use of the public domain, and the use of the public domain, and the use of the public, and the use of the public's own facilities, including the use of the public's own facilities, and the use of the public's own facilities, including the use of the public, and the use of the public's own use of the material material, and the use of the public's own use of the home, changing the face-to-faces, and the use of the public, and the use of the public, and the use of the public material, and the use of the public, and the use of the public facilities, including the use of the home-to-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-specific process of the use of the Internet, including the use of the public domain, and the use of the public resources, including the use of the public domain, and the use of the public domain, including the use of the public domain, and the use of the public domain, including the use of the home, changing the surface meetings with the means of the means of the means of the use of the use of the Internet, and the use of the public domain, and the use of the public domain, including the use
The staff in this dangerous group rarely needs to use a breathing machine.
If a person becomes sick in the plane, well-being to protect the staff and other passengers includes separating a sick person and others at 6 feet, choosing one bird worker to handle the patient, and give him a patient's nose or ask the patient to cover their mouth and noses and tissue when he coughs or sneezing.
Air workers are fit to wear medical gloves that you can throw when serving sick passengers or touch body fluids or areas that may have been infected, and if possible more personal protective equipment if a patient passenger is hot, he is very tired, or difficulty breathing.
Glaves and other tools thrown after use are not suitable to be thrown into special hospital waste bags, and infected areas are suitable for the treatment and cleaning of drugs later. By ship transport, including luxury ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include the journey if you are sick, and separate and inform the health center immediately if one has a temperature or other symptoms when he is on the vessel.
It is appropriate, medical monitoring is done in the isolated person's room. For schools and child protection facilities, CDC recommends a temporary closure to wipe or clean the drug if an infected person has been in a building at school regardless of social distribution.
While there are few distributions to the social average, the techniques of non-competitive and people can be implemented such as interrupting educational trips, meetings, and other large conventions such as sports periods or breast-food training in restaurants, increasing space between desks, loosening times of arrival and departure, reducing the number of unwanted visitors, and using a different area of the health office for children who have symptoms such as influenza.
While there is a major social impact, by talking about strategies to be close to each other, the closure of the school can be considered. For law enforcement workers working on daily operations, the present danger is considered to be below by CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must communicate with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are proposed to follow the same instructions as emergency medical technicians, as well as real defensive equipment.
If there is a close contact at the time of being taken, the workers should clean and purify their belts and work equipment before reuse them with a chip or a home cleaner, and follow the usual working processes and PPE's disposal and laundry.
Osha considers other workers and staff of the mortuary room to be at high risk or in the high risk of infection.
Works that have high risk include healthcare, assistance, labs, transport workers who have touched known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These works become very dangerous to infection if workers are implementing aerosoli processes, or collect or handle the sampiuli from known patients or suspected COVID-19.
The production process of aerosolis includes inserting a tube into the estation, bronkospi, some processes and dental examination, or sample collection by injection,
High-profile tasks of the mortuarys include staff involved in providing known bodies or suspected of having COVID-19 units during their farewell; these become high-profile jobs if they carry out a corpse investigation. The additional engineering controls of these risk groups include the rooms to isolate patients known or suspected of having COVID-19, including the process of breeding aerosolis when implemented.
Special transmission of positive air pressure can be appropriate in some health care settings and mortuary rooms.
Samples should be handled with a safety-season caution of the 3rd Standard.
The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that patients entering the entry into special waiting areas according to whether they are suspected of having COVID-19.In addition to other PPE, OSHA proposes respiratory machines to those working around 6 feet of patients who are known to be, or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who implement the process of producing aerosoli.
In the United States, the N95-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-speed-based system that includes, measuring the fit, training, and medical examination.
Other types of breathing machines can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO recommends ovaroli, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is infected through body fluids.
WHO proposes only operating units for a surveyer in the entry area.
For those who collect samples of the respiratory system from caring for them, or transport COVID-19 patients without the process of producing aerosili, WHO recommends the operation, glasses, face shield, gauni, and gloves.
If the aerosoli production process is implemented, the operation plant is replaced by the N95 or FFP2 respiratory machine.
Since PPE's international acquisition is not enough, WHO proposes to reduce the needs of PPE through the transfer of medical notes, physical restrictions such as windows, to allow only those involved in the direct service to the COVID-19 patient, using the PPE alone for the particular work, continuing to use the respiratory machine without removing it while serving several patients with the same recognition, monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply, and not encouraging the use of the continent to people with symptoms.

ADULTS: [Covid-19] Resting the load and providing the future
FORE/SAA OF THE FAIL: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LESENI: CC0: No rights preserved
We find ourselves in special circumstances this month.
COVID-19 is something that makes it clear our close human relationship in the world and our own commitment.
We have no first place for its challenges, but we do not know that our best answers are based on the kind of emotion-spouse in the world, collaboration, and the creation of society that is the heart of this organization.
Faith and friendship and concern that we have among all our partners via email, phone, and soga are the unique validity of good humans with whom we have been lucky to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to rely on all of you like my comrades.
Last week, there's someone who shared with me his thanks for our work.
He reminded me of the importance of being able to use Wikipedia right now, and the main mark is for this important resource to pray online and available to all people.
Your work makes this possible, whether it is to keep working or our fellows to be paid or our community safe.
The world needs an explanation that Wikipedia gives, this time more than ever.
This is a time when we do not just do, but how we do it, it will bring significant results in the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your work to him, we'll be making some important adjustments about how we work together, starting this next week.
Reform to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team c met last night to discuss our way and schedule for the next day and months.
In the discussion, we considered what we thought would be the correct answer to what we are going through and the best way to develop the organization at this time.
Surprisingly all of us wanted to remove the tribulation and support our long-term mission.
If you want to call us, that's all right.
For employees, montrakta, and all contract staff:
Our daily job prospects will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week to an unknown time.
We don't stop vacation - if you can work for more regular hours, our mission can use you.
However, this world cannot be predicted for now, and whether you need to care for your loved ones, get vegetables, or go to the doctor, your interests are our priority.
We do not follow your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
This should be clear, but we say it.
No days of illness or PTO are needed - just tell your manager and help your team through calendars and schedules to ensure the main workplaces have been handled.
(If you are found to have COVID-19, please tell Bryana in T&C Ops to know so that T&C can help you with help and make sure your situation can be well considered by management).
Workers working for an hour will be paid all the money.
We have already said, and we are again committed to respect our promises to our makontrakta and our staff working for an hour.
Everyone will be paid on the grounds of his regular hours they worked during normal circumstances.
This includes whether you're sick and you can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to deal with their tribulation and our world.
What we do can be very satisfying, especially at such a time.
Again, this is about caring for yourself.
What we ask is that you contact our manager, to know what we should expect and be able to fix what is.
Other works are considered important.
There are some things that we must continue to do.
SRE teams, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising (between other teams) are performing important tasks that may require additional assistance.
We will start the process and all departments to assess current goals and we can aim to support what is important to our mission.
There are many things to do for all of us, all of us will focus on the most important goals.
Speeding now will not harm later.
We don't plan to go for "more time to redeem" soon this tragedy passes.
You will not be expected to work for extra hours to reach conclusions that are currently impossible.
We agree that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and time if possible.
What is done by APP ( Annual Planning)?
To adjust to our new facts and the prospects of daily working hours, we aim to adjust the time of our 2020–2021 Annual presentation.
Our goal is to propose the addition of our 2019–2020 plan that allows more time to budget to allow our employees to give priority to the important work, self-care, and to be treated with their loved ones while putting those who need or want to work for a reduced time for the following few weeks.
The addition of this time reduces the current sword and pressure work in the entire organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Committee next week and we'll inform the delegates and teams about the following steps as soon as possible as we have evidence.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this matter.
Office status, intervention, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our comrades in SF may have contracted COVID-19 virus.
However, with a great lecturer, we hired well-treated cleaning workers to purify all areas at the San Francisco office.
They used a viral killer used in the hospital to purify everywhere, even in the hall and stairs reaching our floor.
This building uses its own role of care that uses products that support the safety of their tenants.
We feel good that the office will be well equipped for the time when we will decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has participated in its COVID-19 and we and all the staff in DC.
Until last week, our DC office moved his jobs to be taken away according to the instructions shared by San Francisco.
According to the understanding of some of the NYC colleagues, we have also been debating about renting the Brooklyn area.
These discussions continue but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work for the first time.
Wenzetu who worked for a long time know that it could be difficult to practice, and they wanted to give reasonable advice:
Reduce the length of meetings by an increase of an hour or two.
If long sessions are needed, consider how they can be separated over a period of days.
Describe the meeting clearly, having a agenda, and a mission early reading resources.
Make the video a choice-based, and tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to enable cooperation and direct combination.
Having a leader to enable each meeting, a man to track soga for questions and track the list of speakers, and someone to help write quotes (or to cooperate in writing quotes).
Send an email with technical assistance if you need a good head device.
Use your well-being compensation to buy snacks.
Join #remoties in Slack to talk to your peers about the work distributed
HR's Operation team is focused on web environmental guidance to help in the increase in the work distributed in Dedication.
This last week we asked all the recipients of the community's grant to regret all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edathons, until WHO announces this tragedy has ended.
We informed them that we understand that our request for regret and other obstacles can make it difficult to complete their approved provisional activities and that no one will be punished for delaying or modifying these goals.
This next week we will follow additional instructions on Wikimania and other regional conferences and the topic community.
The general view from the world's communities seems to express grief for discomfort but comfort clearly and the ability to aim for their own communities, Wikimedia and otherwise.
Continuing forward, CRT deals to keep a page about Meta-Wiki to provide a chance for society to track the results and track our communication with them.
Continue to communicate on issues related to COVID-19
We'll be sending an invitation to your calendar to next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT to a special staff meeting.
We'll take this time to share additional additions, answer your questions and take time to be united themselves.
We're together and we're here to help in any way we can.
Currently, you can continue to find comments from this email, and all other important explanations related to COVID-19, at the Office Wiki.
CRT will shake these pages and all the details in the same place.
We also deal with maintaining frequent contact with workers living in countries that have been affected at present.
If you have any questions about transportation, events, great work, or the challenge of reaching, or anything else you may need help, please do not hesitate to inform and work with CRT.
We're here to help provide the help and cooperation needed.
If you have a private or sensitive issue, please send an email to Bryanm Judan - Director of HR International Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as being abandoned by your work and responsibilities.
Rather, it is a realization that at this time, our work and responsibilities are likely to change in a way we have never seen before.
These are the steps we believe are important in joining the hand so that we can continue working, to give our movement needed, and the world the ministry they can rely on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when time comes.
Currently, it is time to help each other and create a key job position that will be coming in the weeks and months to come.
We need all of you to make it possible, and so we need all of you to protect you with our families so that you can be in good condition when you need to emerge.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doraen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the remaining Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The 2 enzyme of turning b'Angiotensin (ACE2) is an enzyme threatened by the outside (the cell network) of cells in lungs, veins, heart, kidney and gut.
ACE2 faces activities related to enzyme that turns angiotensin (ACE) by reducing the level of the angiotesi-II and adding Ang(1–7) by making it a good medicine to treat heart disease. ACE2 also serves as part of entering the cell of some koronavirus.
The human enzyme edition is referred to from time to time as hACE2.
The 2 enzyme to turn angiotensin is a enzyme zinc of metal atoms in the area of the last cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein has a M2 pepptide of temino N and a unit for transporting amino acid of kolekktini temino C
ACE2 is a protein of the type I of one way, its used digestive team on the upper cell in the lungs and other tissues.
The giligili outside ACE2 has held a membrane with another enzyme known as sheddase, and a molten protein is released from the blood system and eventually released through urine.
ACE2 is found in many organs: ACE2 has been threatened in the membrane of the alveola cells II of the lungs, the small gut, the veins and last veins and soft muscle cells in many organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the brain membrane, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain system.
ACE2's main work is to work as a ACE.
ACE develops the hormone I of angiotensin on angiotensin II of blood pressure.
Its side ACE2 goes on carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Phe) and break it into angiotensin of vasodilator (1–7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also roll several links including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dysnorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the transport of the travel membrane SLC6A19 of natural amino and is cited for Hartnup's disease.
As a membrane protein, ACE2 is used as the main part of entering the cells of some koronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS CoV (Russian which causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (Russian which causes COVID-19).
In particular, the co-operation of SARS-CoV protein and SARS-CoV2 for the ACE2 in the upper part of the cell causes endocosis and the transfer of viruses and enzymes to the endosom within the cell.
This entry process also requires protein processing S and inhibits the main serine proteins of TMPRSS2, a prevention that is currently being investigated as possible treatment. This has caused others to assume that reducing ACE2 levels, in the cell, can help cope with the transmission.
However, many professional and administrative organizations have proposed continuing with the regular ACE and ARB treatment.
System review and meter analysis published on 11 July 2013, found that "the use of ACE's restrictions was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls."
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced to patients treated by ACE restrictions who had a high risk of getting pneumonia, especially those with stroke or heart failure to work.
The use of ACE restrictions was also included in the decline of deaths related to pneumonia, although the results were weaker than the overall risk of pneumonia."
ACE2 connected to humans (rhACE2) has been considered a new treatment of severe lung injuries, and it seemed to improve the body's circulation and oxygen fluid in small pigs with a severe disease caused by the severe respiratory system.
The half life of rhACE2 for humans is 10 hours and will start working after 30 minutes with the reason for results (time) 24 hours.
Several results indicate that rhACE2 may be a good drug for those who cannot tolerate the restrictions of the renin-angitensin system (the RAS) or in diseases where angiotensin II surrounding the love. The rhACE2 mix has been estimated in clinical tests for treatment of chronic respiratory problems.
COVID-19 programs are a mobile-use-use of mobile phone designed to help find people who were engaged to address the korona 2019-20 virus disease, namely the process of identifying people ("people who met them") who may have been influenced by an infected person.
Many programs were made or proposed, and official government assistance in several districts and territories.
Several systems to create prorams to find people who have been in the way are made.
Private issues have been suggested, especially about systems that are based on monitoring the geographic area of software users.
Non-specific substitutes include the use of Bluetooth signals to place the user's close area for other phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple unanimously announced that they would connect operations to accept the Bluetooth programs directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has provided a program that allows citizens to look at if they are in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is used for over 200 Chinese towns. In Singapore, the proframu called TraceTogether is used.
The program was produced by the community and IY of the area, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a program based on Bluetooth to find infected people who can spread and provide immediate response to the health care authority.
The program was produced by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Health Wiraza.
Retrieved 14 April 2020, the program was waiting to be approved by Google Play Store and Appple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that the search program was in the top stages of development, and will be used after a few weeks. The same program is planned in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering the program according to the TraceTogether program of Singapoo and BlueTrace's utilitarian. Russia hopes to establish a program based on the area of patients found to have COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to be confirmed that they are not home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed several functional problems of software systems, including good false views and possible failures if the use of the program is blocked by a small number of people.
To address problems about the distribution of "the korona virus" programs of misleading or bad, Apple places restrictions on what kind of organizations can set programs related to the korona virus in its Program Store, blocking only for the "rasmi" or other prominent organizations.
Google and Amazon have used the restrictions too.
Private campaigners expressed concern about the impact of a large population investigation using the korona virus progitation, especially about whether the infrastructure of the study designed to address the korona virus will be threatened after the disease is controlled.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations have reported saying that restrictions should be put in this type of investigation
The organizations announced four conditions in government projects:
The investigation must be "right, essential, and agreement";
must be the continuation of surveillance and investigation to have temporary rules;
The use of data is determined to have restrictions for COVID-19 purposes.
data safety and unknownness must be protected and shown to be protected according to evidence;
digital investigation must avoid increasing discrimination and isolation;
must share all data and other characters to be defined by law;
There must be protection against abuse and civil justice to deal with abuse;
The important participation of "all important auctions" will be required, including for public health experts and isolated groups. Chaos Computer Club of Germany (CCC) and Writers Without Obstacles (Tone Grenzen) (RSF) also released a list of inspections.
Google/Apple's proposed plan aims to cover the problem of continued investigation by removing the process of the re-existing process from their device's operating system after it is no longer needed.
Other countries used a web-based monitoring rather than software, removing the need to download software and ability and avoid searching.
In Israel, Internet surveillance was approved.
A review based on a network that has access to real local data has important possible private problems.
However, not all systems with a central seva need to have access to the data of the private area; several private care systems are designed that only use the main seva for communication (see the section below).
In South Korea, the non-specific system was used to make a search for people who were in the way.
Instead of using one program, the system collected search details from sources to kill including data for mobile device and card purchases, and included these to give arifa through text messages to people who can be infected.
In addition to using this explanation to inform possible people, the government has also made the local details available to the public, something allowed due to the change of private law of explanation after the MERS outbreak in the country.
These details are available to the public through several programs and websites. Several countries including Germany focused on using major and private conservation systems.
By 6 April 2020, the explanation has not been released.
The search for people in which his privacy is preserved is a well established concept, and the group that was introduced in the past 2013. Until 7 April 2020, many teams of several experts were dealing with private solutions that are easy to use, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to keep the user's close area for other telephones.
However, PEPP-PT is an effort to coordinate which has all the methods of one authority and authority to kill, and not one utilisation. The power-in-chiefs include the Search of the Near Area whose Private Area Archived Authority Anuai Authority (DP-DP-3T), the Asian Number of Time (TCN, fka the Asian Number of the Event, CEN), the Private Foundations and the Tracking Methods of the Phone (PACT) and others.
These kiks, personal data that can be detected is not on the device, and all comparisons are made on the device.
The Private group has been making SafePaths, a search for private storage techniques during collecting and using the area or data to track COVID-19 infections.
Based on research from the whipaper "The ‹ Has Been Lagai: Keeping Personal Private Private Private in the explosion" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace of Enigma MPC, a company that develops private technologies that was also established in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses safe chips to allow users to share a sensitive area and health data for users and other officials, without affecting the privacy of the data.
On 5 April, the TCN International Cooperation was established by groups that had been associated with similar techniques with the corresponding utilification, with the aim of reducing division, enabling international cooperation of search and reporting programs, an important part of achieving large use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapoo government announced that it opened the BlueTrace version used by its official government program.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Appe, companies that control Android and iOs, announced a plan to find people who were engaged, which claimed to be private defenders, according to the combination of Bluetooth Low Enerygy technology and the cover of private conservation.
They also published the basic technology content used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be released in three stages:
providing tools to enable the government to create official search programs for people with korona virus that protects privacy
The combination of this operation directly in iOS and AndroidGoogle and Apple's plan to address ongoing research problems by first distributing the system through the use of the operating system, and later removing it in a similar way after the threat ends.
The replacement of the drug (also known as using other drugs, setting a new shape, causing new work or replacement) is to kill the approved drug for treatment of different diseases or treatment rather than using it for previously produced reasons.
This is one way of scientific research that is currently being tracked to develop safe treatment and COVID-19.
Other research guidelines include the cultivation of COVID-19 vaccines and take the body of a recovered person and sent them to a patient through blood. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 pharmaceutical proteins, which each has many molecular areas.
Critical analysis of these connecting areas offers a good project to create a better antivirus drug that will release COVID-19 proteins.
The most targeted SARS-CoV-2 proteins are protease as shark, RNA based on RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophostase.

A major research continues at Duke University and Oxford.
NYU Gatene Medical School is conducting safety and efficiency of the use of hydroxychloroquine.
A clinic test in Wuhan and Shenzhen showed the fucking favipiravir was "season"
35 patients in Shenzen were tested and the results were negative on an average of 4 days, where the length of illness was 11 days for 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan for 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Drug Association reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is rare and original.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its savings, and use the military to send the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an early conversation with Trump's administration about buying the drug, which may not be a major factor in severe illness where viruses have already increased.
It may not be safe to be used by pregnant women or those who try to get pregnant.
One study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir virus and ritonavir, concluded that "no profit was seen".
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from producing copies by protease.
The research team at the University of Colorado are trying to change the drug to obtain a cell that will connect with SARS-CoV-2 protein. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing the resources to change drugs created to treat HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Union attempt.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections . Gilead Sciences later found that Remdesivir had a viral operation in vitro against filo-, pneummo-, paramyxo-, and korona virus.
One issue and the treatment of viral treatment is the opposition's priorities through changes that can cause severe illness and infections.
Some early remdesivir studies show that it can be a major genetic barrier. There are several clinical tests that continue, including two by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate and other diseases for people with more severe illness.
There are three ongoing tests of vitamin C to pass on hospital and are suffering heavily from COVID-19; two controlled units (Uchina, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a design vaccine to prevent the korona 2019 virus (COVID-19).
Although no panel completed clinical tests, there are several ongoing attempts to create the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2, a virus causing the disease, found in less than 18 months.
Five selected vaccines were in the study of the Awamu I in April.
COVID-19 was recognized in December 2019.
The world's largest explosion in 2020, causing large investment and research operations.
Many organizations use genomes published to create possible vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2.
cited in April, the needs of the CEPI program for the development of vaccines are fast, production capacity, standard use, and reach of the world.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and development at the beginning of 2020 to create a suitable vaccine to prevent COVID-19.
The main goals of the jukwa that continued in the I Awamu security research include:
Cell acid (DNA and RNA) (The I phase and selected vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus monitoring tools (the I and the selected panel: CanSino Biologics, adeno virus of the 5th type.
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 selected vaccines are being developed in the early stages, with 78 confirmed as ongoing projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 have been announced, but with a few details available to the public (they are thought to be organized or formed).
The I-II Awamu test runs an initial safety test and immunogenist, usually not following a special procedure, controlled through a platinum and in the areas of the awai, while identifying the most accurate dorsal and fafu.
The III phase tests usually involve more participants, including a group of disorientation, and measure the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while following the negative impact on the best measure.
Of the 79 selected progressive vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April), 79 vaccines had not been given to man (still in research "before clinical testing").
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is conducting a study of a molecular vaccine that can change viral proteins to stimulate body immunity.

On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, reported the development of cells such as korona virus under sehemi's scholarship from Canada Institutes of Health Research.
A test test of vaccines is in laboratory research, and a human test program is planned in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trumo gave CureVac, "a large amount of money for the unique reach of Covid-19 vaccine", which the German government opposed.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical Company Pfizer announced collaboration with the German BioNTech company to form a vaccine based on mRNA.
The selected vaccine that is based on mRNA, BN162, is currently measured by animals and the clinic measurements are expected to begin in April 2020.

Other CEPI investment members for the development of COVID-19 vaccine are Modema, Curevac, Innovao, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun animal testing using six selected vaccines.
Imperial College researchers in London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing the strongest RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The selected vaccine was provided within 14 days of receiving order from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced $275 million to fund 96 medical testing projects against COVID-19, including several vaccines appointed in Canadian companies and universities, such as Mediterranean plans and University of Saskatchewan.
Meanwhile, the Canadian government announced $12 million to develop COVID-19 vaccine alone, with plans to establish a national "a vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if another korona virus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers of Pittsburgh University of Medical School reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, saying that "MNA released small SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines persuaded strong antijeni-in-the-specific response of antibodies [within mice] which appeared to be an idea from 2 weeks after the vaccine."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, Waterloo University of Medicine School announced the structure of a designated vaccine based on DNA as a possible nose spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be made from copies within the human bacterium to release cells as harmless viruses, which can stimulate the immune system to release the immune system against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, the industry, and three U.S. universities provided resources to reach the main computer from IBM, as well as the resources to provide computer services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Other vaccines have different effects, also known as non-special effects.
This means that they can be more beneficial than a disease that prevents them.
Further tests without special procedures in Australia are seeking to hire 4,170 employees of health care.
It is possible that the vaccines developed were unsafe or will not bring the expected results.
Early research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using special covid-19 units of animal animals, such as ACE2 with genes from mice, other laboratory animals, and other non-human cells, show the need for the 3rd level of prevention of infectious cells, and international coordination to ensure safety processes.
Vaccination against SARS and MARS have been measured in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no treatment or vaccine to protect against SARS that have been shown to be safe and the expected results for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, recognition and growth of vaccines and new treatment drugs to treat SARS was a matter of priority for governments and public health organizations around the world. There is also no vaccine confirmed against MERS.
While MARS began to spread, it was believed that the existing SARS research can provide an important example of developing vaccines and treatment against MERS-CoV infections.
Until March2020, there was one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) which completed the Ith phase test for humans, and three others continue, all of which are a vaccine to prevent viruses, two DNA virus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications have developed a diplomatic theory claiming that the virus causing COVID-19 were known and that vaccines were already available.
The patents mentioned by various social media publications refer to existing patents of the anti-specific series and vaccines for other types of korona virus such as SARS's koronavirus.
The korona 2019 virus (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by the korona virus of severe respiratory disorder (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and respiratory problems.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat lesions, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
From the time of infection and symptoms to be seen by the auction is about five days but can start on the second or fourteenth day.
While a large number of cases cause severe symptoms, some promote viral pneumonia or organs to stop working.
By 17 April 2020, over 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 nations and asylums, causing over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, especially among people who are close, often through small drops given when they cough, sneeze, or talk.
Although these drops are produced when you wash out, they fall to the floor or to areas than to infect each other at a long distance.
People can also be infected by touching an infected area and then touch their eyes, noses, or mouth.
The virus can live in areas until 72 hours.
It is more infected in the first three days after the symptoms have been seen, although its spread is possible before the symptoms are seen and in later stages of illness. The common process of investigating the actual adaptation of the polymerasi (rRT-PCR) from the cells released in the nose.
People who suspect having viruses and adoptives are recommended to use the continent.
Public proposals generally wear mainlands vary, with some authorities suggesting their lack of use, some suggesting to be used and others requiring people to use it.
Currently, there is no vaccine or special treatment to protect COVID-19 virus.
Internal infections have been reported in many countries for all six WHO areas.
Those infected with the virus may be wrong with symptoms or show symptoms such as influenza, fatigue, and respiratory problems.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory problems, pain or pressure that continues in the chest, confusion, walking problems, and face or blue mouth; it is advised to find treatment if these symptoms exist.
Uncommonly; symptoms in the upper part of breathing such as sneezing, just as a nose or throat pain can be seen.
Symptoms in the stomach such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea have been seen in a different percentage.
Other cases in China showed emphasis on the chest and heart transplants alone.
In other cases, illness may remain pneumonia, the organs kill them from working with death.
This is known as a period of maturity.
The COVID-19 period is usually five to six days but can be from second or fourteen.
97.5 percent of people who show symptoms will show within 11.5 days after infection. Ripit shows that not all infected will show signs.
The role of these non-recognitions in infections is still unknown, however, the original evidence shows that they can contribute to the distribution of disease.
The ratio of infected people is not now known and is being researched, and Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting by 20% of all confirmed people continued to show symptoms in the hospital.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include people who do not show signs in their daily cases on 1 April; 166 people infected that day, 130 people (78%) did not show signs during testing.
The cough and saliva can have high levels of viruses,
Talking aloud bites more drops than talking normal.
Research in Singapoo showed that coughing without covering can cause drops to 4.5 feet (4.5 m).
Although the virus is not usually distributed in the air, the National Academy of Sciences has proposed that it is potentially contagious through air particles and air collectors in the way outside the people's rooms had positive samples of RNA virus.
Some medical procedures such as importing a tube and revive the heart and lungs (CPR) can cause asthma liquids to be converted into air and thus cause spread through the air.
Although there is concern that it can be spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low, which can be highly infected when people show symptoms; although infections are possible before the symptoms are seen, its risk is small.
The European Center for Kuzia and Disease Control (ECDC) states although it is unclear how the disease spreads, one person generally infects two or three others, which the virus stays on the spread of hours to several days.
In particular, the virus was found to be discovered for a day on the cardboard, to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and steel (ISI 304), and up to four hours in the copper of 99%.
This, however, differs according to moisture and heat.
The soap and cleaning medication are also better if used properly; soap products weaken the immune column of viral oil, maiming its strength, as well as releasing them with skin and other areas.
Other fluids, such as bezalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (the operation system), are not working well. In research in Hong Kong studenty, saliva samples were taken on an average of two days after starting to be hospitalized.
Among six patients, the first sample showed the highest rate of viruses and the sixth patient showed the highest level of viruses on the second day of testing.
A severe respiratory disorder, koronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new korona virus of severe respiratory problems,
All the components of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus appear in viruses related to the korona in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is eaten by home-based sevens, which split its immune chip. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the natural SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus reaches viral cells through enzaim angiotensin-turning enzaim 2 (ACE2), which is widely found in the II alveolalar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special gliprotin of the areas known as "spike" (peplomer) to merge with ACE2 and enter the cell.
A severe heart injury was found in 12% of people infected and hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is a major factor in severe illness.
The symptoms of heart disease are high, due to the disease of the system of response to sedition and immune system during the development of the disease, but the severe injury of the heart wall may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receivers are widely seen in the heart and are involved in heart function.
Many episodes of heart-based shock ( 31%) and blood begin to freeze in a vein (25%) have been found for ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with bad predictions. A study of the dead dead by COVID-19 has found special changes due to the disease (DAD), and lymph-size cells in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV 2 has a ACE-2 growth that shows cells that stretch your body's faces in the respiratory system, patients with COVID-19 severe have a systemic hypainflammation symptoms.
In particular, T cells coming from GM-CSF germs that fell in accordance with the use of monosites that release IL-6 of tumors and causes severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
A rare skin disease has also been reported during blood tests.
WHO has published several aspects of the pain of the disease.
The standard test method is in the research laboratory to monitor gene access (rRT-PCR).
The study is usually made on breath samples available by a sample of the nose clinic tests; however; a sample of kohozi and saliva can also be used.
The overall results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood measurements can be used, but they need two blood samples that took two weeks aside and the results have limited value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the stress of the korona virus and the genetic series so that labs around the world could develop the ratings of special DNA samples to detect the virus's transmission.
As of April 2020, antibodies (which can detect serious infections and if a person had previously been infected) were going on but has not been widely used.
Chinese testing experience has shown accuracy only 60 to 70 percent.
FDA in the United States approved the first treatment attempt on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of the month. The recognition guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuham University were sensitive to the methods of detecting infections according to the characteristics of clinics and the risk of epidemic diseases.
Two soft and multiple steel with side parts used to monitor asthma cords ,
The presence of Subpleural in abundance, the evil way (the fat related to the lobular and the different alveolasi servant), and the integration can be seen as the disease continues.
A few data is available about small lesions and COVID-19 pathophosis.
The main result of the study of the corpse's investigation is:
Eye study: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung filled with liquid rather than air and water collection in tissue and lung air space.
Four types of viral pneumonia are considered to be examined:
Non-season Nimonia: pulmonary oedema, pneummocyte hypoplasia, charge atypical pneummocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infilation and the structure of a large cell.
Nimonia: special changes in the lungs due to a liquid disease (DAD) from the lungs.
DAD is filled with acute respirary distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hipsemia.
The healing Nimonia: liquid delivery in the gaps of gum and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: serious problems where proteins that control blood freeze zna becomes more serious (DIC);
The protective measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands with soap and water occasionally for at least 20 seconds, training to have good coughing manners and avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth and hands that are not washed.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when you cough or sneezing and recommends using the elbow if no tissue is available.
The proper purity of hands after y cough or sneezing is urged.
CDC has proposed using the surface restrictions on the public environment, to prevent infections from a person who shows symptoms. The process of isolation and society aims to reduce the interaction with infected people in large groups by closing schools and working places; preventing transportation and banning large public debates.
The guidelines for staying away from people also include people to stay away for at least 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no known drug to work on COVID-19. Although no vaccine is expected until 2021 as soon as possible, the key part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to reduce the rate of the explosion, known as "reducing infection"
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands occasionally with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when dirt is seen in the hands, before eating and after scraping as a scissor, coughing or sneezing.
It further suggests using alcohol-free hands at least 60% of the killing of germs, but it is when soap and water are not available. In areas where anti-specific hands are not readily available, WHO offers an internal production formula.
In these structures, the imperial activity is based on ethanol or isopropanoli.
Hidrojeni peroxide is used to help remove bacterial seeds within alcohol; it is not "a substance used for hand labels"
Gliseroli is added as a substance used to keep things moist.
People are treated with care, which may include using liquids as treatment, oxygen aid, and treatment of other affected organs.
CDC suggests that those who suspect that they have this virus to wear a common continent.
An external breath device (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory problems, but its benefits are still being considered.
Physical hygiene and healthy life and nutrition have been recommended to improve immunity.
Treatment can be used for those who show less severe symptoms at the beginning of the infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published proposals to care for people admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19.
Doctors of critical condition and lung doctors in the United States have included medical proposals from organizations to kill him as a free resource, IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no special COVID-19 treatment.
In symptoms, some experts recommended paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of the buprofen as the first option to use.
The caution must be maintained to reduce viral infections, especially in the health care environment during the process that can provide erosoli, such as keeping neli or passing air to the patient by hand.
For healthcare professionals who treat people with COVID-19, CDC proposes to place a person in the Air Consolidation Room (AIIR) as well as using common reviews, the reviews of people who have contact with air-based attention.CDC provides guidance on how to use Self-protective Tools (PPE) during a major disaster.
The proposed clothing is: PPE's gas, a breath or a barkoa, the eye-shaped and the medical gloves. When found, breathings (rather than the mainland) are recommended.
N95 reviews have been approved for industrial environment but FDA has approved the use of the continent under Emergency Use (EUA).
They have been designed to protect against flying particles such as dust but its efficiency against specific biological cells is not confirmed for undiscorporated use.
While the continent is not available, CDC recommends using facial restrictions, or as the final option, home-made land.
Most COVID-19 events are not too severe to require air-in-airing reactors or substitutes, but it is needed for a large percentage of events.
The type of respiratory aid for people with respiratory problems related to COVID-19 is being researched for people in the hospital, and some evidence that keeping the tube can be avoided by a air import device at a high level.
It is unclear whether one of these two causes equal benefits to people who are very sick.
Some doctors prefer to use air ventilation reactors when available because this method reduces liquid cells compared to a high-profile ventilation device. The severe events are common to the elderly (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough beds of everyone, which reduces the capacity of the health system to address the sudden events of COVID-19 which is too severe to need hospital admission.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to the units of people in critical condition, 2.3 percent needed breathing machines and 1.4 percent died.
In China, about 30% of hospital admissions due to COVID-19 , were eventually admitted to a critical room.
It is more difficult to use air ventilation reactors as severe respiratory disorder (ARDS) occurs with COVID-19 and is increasingly difficult to increase oxygen.
Air transmission devices that can control pressure and PEEP are required to increase oxygen delivery and still reduce the risk of a lung injury related to the air transmission device
The top PEEP may not be found in old air importers.
A possible medical study began in January 2010, and several antivirus drugs are being tested for clinics.
Remdesivir seems to bring good results.
Although new drugs can reach 2021 to be developed, a number of drugs already measured have been approved for other uses or are more measured.
Virus prevention can be used by people with severe illness.
WHO proposed volunteers to participate in effective and safety tests of possible treatment. FDA has issued temporary permission to distribute antibodies as experimental treatment in events where the person's life has been heavily threatened or immediately.
It has not been through clinical research needed to show that it is safe and practical for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a telephone program and dealt with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to have their name and identification number.
The program can discover "the man you've got around" by scoring the data of investigation and so being able to detect the potential danger and infection.
Each user can also look at the situation of three other users.
If the possible risk has been discovered, the program does not only recommend isolation, but also informs domestic health officials. A major analysis of phone data, facial intelligence technology, mobile phone monitoring and machine awareness serves to track infected people with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapoo.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to monitor mobile phone data of people believed to have a korona virus.
The move was taken to ensure their isolation and protection of those who can be influenced by infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom participated in the total data of the telephone area and the German federal government organization, Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent the virus from spreading.
Russia spread the technology of facial recognition to discover them to break the katanti law.
Giulio Galerera, Italian provincial health Commissioner, said he has been informed by mobile phone providers as "40% of the people continue to walk-walk only".
The German government operated an event to create computer software and over 42.000 members.
Also, the Estonian president, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for creative solutions against the spread of the korona virus.
People can suffer tribulations, travel restrictions, the effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rary O'Connoe saying, "The increased isolation of people, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economics are a better way to harm mental health and well-being."
The disease may have few symptoms or have no symptoms, similar to another common respiratory disease such as cold.
A chronic illness usually recovers within two weeks, where people with severe or critical condition can take three or six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at high risk of infection with COVID-19 according to data compared to other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 data is missing. For other people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
For people who are heavily affected, COVID-19 can quickly increase as chronic respiratory disease (ARDS) which causes a total loss of damage, ogan infections or ogans kill them to fail to work.
Problems related to COVID-19 include bacterial disease, blood clots, heart damage, kidney and liver damage.
The normal blood freeze, especially the increase in prothrobin's time, has been described in 6% of those hospitalized due to COVID-19, where unusual kidney function is seen in 4% of this group.
About 20–30% of people with COVID-19 show many liver enzymes (high liver damage units)
According to the report, the average time between the symptoms seen and death was ten days, and five days used to be hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to the intensive room had an average of seven days between hospital admission and death.
In a study of early conditions, the average time to show the initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and the full rate of six to 41 days.
In a survey by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a 2.8% death rate where women had a 1.7% death rate.
Histopathology measurements of post-dead lung samples show some changes in the lung structure and severe respiratory disease throughout the lungs.
The major changes between cells were also seen in gum cells.
A lung image is similar to severe respiratory disorder (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage was seen by increased levels of troponni or heart attack.
According to March data from the United States, 89 percent of those hospitalized had previously conditions. Access to medical resources and regional social and economic conditions can also affect the condition of dying.
Estimates of deaths from this situation vary due to the provincial differences, but also due to the problems of special techniques.
Low numbers of severe cases can cause an estimated death rate.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of infected people before may mean that the current death rate has been ignored.
Smoking smokers were more likely to have COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more of needing special treatment or dying compared to non-moking people. Questions have been given about the time the disease will be.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority became a rate dropped to 20 to 30 percent in lung capacity for people who recovered the disease, lung measurements showed the destruction of the ogans.
This can also lead to health problems that remain after severe illness.
By March 2020, it was unknown if the original transmission provided a suitable and long-term defense within for those who had this disease.
Defense appears as likely, according to the behavior of other korona virus, but there is a report of events that people have recovered COVID-19 and are accompanied by positive levels of the korona virus in the future.
These events are believed to be increasing by long-term infections rather than new conclusions.
The virus is thought to be natural and from animals, through spread infections.
Its source is unknown but by December 2019, the infection was due to infections from one person to another.
A study of the first 41 COVID-19 events controlled, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, showed the first date that the symptoms began was 1 December 2019.
Official publications from WHO reported that the first signs to appear were on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to measure the mortality rate.
These numbers vary according to the county and time and are affected by the number of measurements, the quality of the health care system, medical options, time since the first explosion has occurred with population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.
In late 2019, WHO handed over the ICD-10 emergency attacks which are U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in romance and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 tested medical or physiology without SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in the news. The death supply according to cases reflects the number of deaths being divided by the number of cases measured within a period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death supply according to cases in the world is 6.9% (153,822/2,240.191) to 17 April 2020.
The numbers vary according to the county. Other measures include the death rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of discovered people who die due to illness, and the death rate of infections (IFR), which shows the percentage of infected people (discovered by the unrecognised) who die due to illness.
These statistics are not restricted by time and follow a number of people from infection to the solution of the case.
Although not all infected people get antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide a description of the number of people who are infected.
At the center of the explosion in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread in the Kanivali ceremony, and the spread of young people, causing less deaths, and not all COVID-19 deaths can be officially listed in that way.
Furthermore, the German health system has not failed.
In the Netherlands, about 3 percent may have antibodies, as was confirmed from blood donors.
69 (0.0004% of the population) have been confirmed dead due to COVID-19.
The effects of this disease and its death rate are different for men and women.
In a study conducted in China and Italy, the death rate is high for men.
The main risk is for men aged 50 and older, and the gap between men and women closes at only 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7% for women.
The real reasons for this gender diversity are unknown, but the elements of nature and behavior may be the reason.
The differences in gender-related immunity, women's smoking rate and men have more than one disease such as blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to high deaths for men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were men and 72% of the dead due to COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not follow data related to the sex of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect different men and women.
A large percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization announced 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO's chief Tedros Adharno Ghebreyesus, explained that CO represents korona, VI for viruses, D for disease and 19 is the first year the explosion was discovered: 31 December 2019.
This name was selected to avoid referring to a specific geographic area (k.m. China), species of animals or groups, according to international proposals on providing a name aimed at preventing stigma. Virus causes COVID-19 are called a korona virus of severe asthma 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses " COVID-19 virus" and "Russians causing COVID-19" in public communication.
Disease and viruses are commonly known as "the korona virus".
During the first explosion in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly known as "the korona virus" and " Wuhan's koronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO proposed that the severe respiratory disease of 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov as temporary names of the virus and the disease according to 2015 guidance that opposes using areas as names of disease and viruses,
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-12 were released on February 11, 2020.
Because of the power restrictions in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers publish health care facilities such as nose cleaners and ventilation areas.
In one example, when the Italian hospital quickly needed a ventilation tube, and the seller was unable to submit for a time, the domestic dealer created and published 100 necessary units for a night.
After the first COVID-19 extension, false theories, false information and lack of information emerged regarding the roots, standard, immunity, treatment and other resources of illness and spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread viruses to other animals.
Research failed to find evidence of the virus to be absorbed by pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drug or vaccine was confirmed to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is promoted by government agencies, academic groups, and research researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "The UMOJA Test" to assess the impact of four existing drugs fighting viruses with a large promise of prosperity.
No vaccine is available, but organizations kill them develop a variety of vaccines.
The original SARS-CoV works are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 all use ACE2 receiver to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies that are being investigated.
First, researchers intend to create a vaccine for all viruses.
The use of viruses like this, whether not working or dead, aims to increase the effects of human body antibodies to new COVID-19 infections.
The second method, the vaccine section, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system feel certain parts of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 event, such research focuses on S-spike protein that helps the virus incorporates the ACE2 enzyme receiver.
The third method is of a cell acid vaccine ( DNA or RNA, a new method of producing vaccines).
Experimental vaccines from any of these techniques will have to be tested for safety and efficiency. On March 16, March 2020, the first test of the vaccine clinic began with 4 volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine has an harmless genetic code copied from the disease. The immune-based improvement has been proposed as the possible challenge of the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but is controversial.
There are over 300 clinical tests that are ongoing from April 2020.
Seven attempts were assessing already confirmed treatment of malaria, including four hydroxychloroquine studies or chloroquine.
Retrieved antivirus drugs include a lot of Chinese research, and the III phase tests in several countries due to reports before the end of April.
A study of the development of the COVID-19 vaccine clinic continues, starting in April 2020. Several antivirus drugs are assessed for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta.
There is evidence of the efficiency of remdesivir, beginning in March 2020.
The development of the clinic was seen for patients treated by the use of remdesivir.
The III clinical test is conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Kloroquini, which was originally used to treat malaria was researched in China in February 2020, using the original results.
However, there is a call for a survey of the research's Americans.
The Korean and Chinese Health Authority proposed the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan's Virology Institute, although it recommends a daily rating of a gram, notes that using the standard twice is very dangerous and can cause death.
On March 28, 2020, FDA issued a permit for the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine voluntarily of doctors who treat people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese edition also includes the use of interferon, interestvirin or umifnovir to prevent COVID-19.
The original data shows the high rate of interestvirin is necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in a glass vessel.
I willzaxonide has been proposed for more volo research after showing a low-profile blockage of SARS-CoV-2. Research has shown that the increase in protein provisions using transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRS2) is important to SARS-CpV-2 entry through contact with ACE2 receptors.
Research on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine should or not have a merthromycin cell has a significant shortage that has prevented medical professionals from embracing this treatment without further research being done. Oselmivir does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 in the formation and does not have a role known in COVID-19 treatment.
The presence of Cytokinine protein in abundance can lead to a combination in the later levels of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have characteristics of combating the excessive increase of cytokini. Tocilizumab is included in the medical instructions of the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was completed.
It passes through a 2nd term of non-specific measurements at the national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with severe illness.
Mixed with the blood measure of the ferry's policy to identify the excessive increase in cytokin, it is designed to deal with such results, which are considered the cause of deaths among infected people.
An interleukin-6 receivers was approved by FDA due to later research on the treatment of the high-profile cytokin disease caused by different reasons, CAR cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no special evidence, controlled as tocimizumab is the best CRS's trophys.
The transfer of antibodies published and deeply produced by the immune systems of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need it is being investigated as a non-defeated method of immune body.
This technique was tested for SARS and incomplete results.
The balance of the virus is the expected method of action in which an unincorporated treatment of antibodies can bring protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other techniques, such as cell-based and/or phagocytosis that support antibodies, are possible.
Other methods of non-medical treatment, for example, using one - type oak antibodies are formed.
The production of a cure vaccine, with part of a blood liquid from patients who have recovered and has antibodies that are special for the virus, can increase due to rapid production.
koronavirus disease, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, daktrari at Wuhan General Hospital, who was later infected and farewell to the world due to COVID-19 after educating the public about the spread of the virus.
