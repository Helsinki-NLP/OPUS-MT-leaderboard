The Welsh Council delegates are concerned about 'looking as puppets'
There is concern among some delegates after the proposal that their position should be changed to MWP (The Welsh Parliament).
This is due to a plan to change the council's name as the Welsh Parliament.
Council delegates from all political units are concerned that the move will cause sarcasm.
A Leba delegate said that his group was concerned that the name "likes Twp and Pwp."
For readers abroad of Wales: In the Swedish twp means stupid and pwp means feces.
The Plaid's messenger said that the group is generally "not pleased" and has proposed an alternative name.
The Conservativeist said his group was "open in thought" about the change of the name, but he said it was the summary of MWP to the puppet.
In this context, the letter w in the Swedish is pronounced the same as the letter in Yorkshire English.
The Council's club, which currently forms law to establish a change of name, said: "The final decision about any basic word regarding how the Council delegates are actually referred to will be of the delegates themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act paid the Welsh council the authority to change its name.
In June, Jopo published the results of consultation with the public on proposals that were widely supported by referring to the council as the Welsh Parliament.
In connection with the position of Council delegates, Jopo preferred the delegates of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but MWP's choice received further support in consultation with the public.
Also seen, Council delegates recommend an alternative option, but efforts to reach agreement may be a challenge to the Executive Officer, Elin Jones, aabye is expected to submit a law draft about change after a few weeks.
The law on change will include other changes on how the council works, including laws to eliminate the merit of the Council Commissioner and the structure of the committee system.
The Council delegates will vote last on the name they will be called when they are discussing the law.
The Macedonians will vote on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether they change the country's name as "North Macedonia."
This famous vote was planned to resolve a conflict that has existed in a decade with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
The authorities in Athens insist that the name of neighboring countries in the north represents a claim to their territory and has continued to oppose its request to become a member of the European Union and the NATO Union.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of a direct referendum on changing the name, has said he will ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the move to change the name is needed so they can join the European Union and the NATO Union.
St. Martin Passes Silent as Churches at Harlem Passing Chagamoto
"History, old men who I've played with say there was a church and a bar in every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, no one."
He said the absence of bars is something that can be understood.
"People talk differently" nowadays, he said.
"Bas have hesitated to be like a neighbor's living where people meet from time to time."
On the church side, he is concerned that the money available from selling property will not last as long as the leaders expect them, "and soon they will return to their first condition."
Churches, added, may be converted into large-levels with private households who will not help care for the remaining reserves in neighboring areas.
"A large number of people who buy private homes in these compositions will be white," he said, "and so this situation will extend these churches to be closed in general because there is no possibility that people in these horrors will be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white allies before Harlem became a city of black people - the City Community in 1870 and called St. Martin a decade later.
The white-American members left the 1930s.
Members who were black participating in the nearby area took over the leagues.
St. Martin became under black allies under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a reja strike in 125th Street, the main street for purchase in Harlem, who refused to hire or cooperate with black people.
When the fire that occurred in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but when members in the priest Johnson church set plans to rebuild it, they gave the authority to establish the location of a set of bells played with keyboards or automatic method.
Priest David Johnson, son of priest Johnson and St. Martin's successor, called a set of bells "the poor's weights."
An expert who played a bell set in July called another name: "The cultural theme" and "a historical unchangeable story."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also recognized that it was the first set of bells in the world that was played by black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest set area in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not seek someone else to take over.
The bells played in St. Martin for the past several months have been played by architects and contractors in a complicated way, some of whom were brought by church leaders, and others were brought by the diocese of the Bishop.
The administrative body in the parish, which includes church administrators - wrote diocese in July concerned that the diocese "had a plan to transfer costs" to the council, even though the council had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors who were sent by the diocese.
Some partners complained of the absence of transparency from the diocese.
Pope injures a 13-year-old child while diving to trap a rope-tree in Califonia
The Pope attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving to trap a rope-tree in Carlifonia on the first day of the string-tree season, officials said.
The invasion occurred shortly before 1 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV television television in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for assistance and then rowed with a group to help him get into the water.
Hammel said that the first time he thought it was just a thrill to trap a rope-tree, but "I found that he was screaming, 'I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His shoulder nail had come out," Hammel said he discovered it after approaching a boy.
"I shouted for everyone to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
A boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed as in critical condition.
The shark species who made an invasion is unknown.
The captain of Rescue Larry Giles said in a press session that the pope had been seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was defined as not a species of dangerous sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the upper part of his body.
Officials closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles suggested that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury wants to fight Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using the beauty styles with staff who are assistant professionals.
As a large part of planning to enter the beauty market of £ 2.8 billion in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and household equipment are reduced, large beauty columns will be tested in 11 stores across the country and are established in more stores next year if this action is successful.
Investment in beauty has come as supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelf spaces that were used to keep television, microweves and household equipment.
Sainsbury said that it will double the production of beauty products to 3,000, including editions such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The editions from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more space with areas set up similar to those in stores such as Boots.
This large store also reopens the store of various cosmetics products so that most of the goods do not eat meat - which is heavily pressured by young buyers.
In addition, retail perfume dealer Fragnance Show will experiment in two Sainsbury stores, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week and the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online purchases and privileges of daily food products at a low rate in a nearby retail store means supermarkets are forced to make more effort to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the main executive in Sainsbury, has said that the store will have more looks like the units' store stores while the pick of supermarkets trying to deal with Aldi and Lidl for providing more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has been starting small Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also established some Habitats stores from when it purchased the two-year picks, which says it has increased vegetable sales and made customers more beneficial.
The original attempt of the large store to revive its beauty units and drugs failed.
Sainsbury tested a joint project with Boots in the early 2000s, but the coalition broke after a dispute arose about how to share revenue from the pharmaceutical stores that were in its supermarkets.
A new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury sold his 281 store industry to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £25 million, three years ago.
Lloyds is said to contribute to the plan, by adding more high-profile brands of facial care and skin including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business, said: "We have changed the appearance and condition of our beauty ranges to improve the environment of our customers.
We have also placed in professional workers who will be available to offer advice.
Our various editions have been designed to meet all the needs and environment that appeal to the right place means that we have now been a thrilling place of beauty products where it offers a great rivalry in the original ways to make shopping."
Peter Jones's 'aghadha' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million business plan
Dragons Den star, Peter Jones was left as a 'season' after television broadcaster Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million good news program and his life-season brand business to focus more on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has little time for their Truly brand of home products and spares.
The two trade was connected to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Palatrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning, wrote in Instagram to announce that he is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons star" Den Peter Jones as a victim of withdrawal from their grand-season-season-season brand-story-story-season-to consider his new grand contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones "he was furious" when the popular girl in television admitted to a very nervous meeting on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, being his new business plans - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that he would not have enough time to handle their home brand and Truly spares.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Palatrow and had been said to increase Willoughby's wealth estimated to be £ 11.
When Willoughby, aged 37, wrote in Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly's business, Jones left England by plane to one of his vacation homes.
The source of the news said: "Truly was one of the things Holly focused more.
It was to be his permanent match that would enable him to continue for more than decades to come.
His decision to withdraw was very surprising to everyone involved.
No one believed what was going on on Tuesday, the launch time was very close.
There are warehouses full of goods at Marlow Headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this present Morning show broadcaster, all of which can be more trusted in the United Kingdom, can cost the millions of money from large investment in products including rivers, candles, clothes and household equipment and the possibility of delay in launch.
And it can indicate the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and the monk Dan Baldwin has been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple go on vacation with Jones who owns 40% in the Baldwin Ringa factory.
Willoughby is expected to be the M&S brand ambassador and will take over Ant McPartlin as a host of I'm A Celebrity.
The source of information near Jones said last night that "We could not comment on its controversial activities."
A firm conversation 'and then we loved each other'
He joked about criticism that he would get from news agencies by commenting that others would consider "unfair president" and in praising North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump become more desperate?
Trump said in his sarcastic voice "Reporter".
"I haven't given up for anything."
He suggested that Kim prefers to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapuri in June to be praised by Trump as a major step in removing nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But nuclear anti-nuclear negotiations have been stuck.
Over three months after a meeting in June in Singapuri, North Korean famous ambassador Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in U.N. The United Nations General Assembly Saturday that the North Korean nation has not seen "a corresponding step" from the United States for the early stages of removing North Korea.
Instead, he said, Marekena has continued the obstacles that focus on increasing pressure.
Trump had a hopeful attitude in his speech a public meeting.
"We're going well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight North Korea.
Millions would lose their lives.
Now we've started a good partnership."
He said his efforts to improve collaboration with Kim have brought good results - to cancel rocket tests, to help in the release of hostages and help in the restoration of the homes of the American troops.
And he defended his unusual way to discuss his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to enter this crowded field, we would have 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.

Although residential shelters due to tsunami effects have been built in Aceh, they are not widely found in coastal areas.
The lack of tsunami warning bells in Palu, even though the warning existed, may have contributed to disaster.
In the best situation, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters perform complicated transport operations.
The hospital ship set in Lombok for treatment of earthquake victims is likely to be Pau, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster area.
President Joko Widodo used the infrastructure that captured in Indonesia as the core of your elected campaigns, and has spent a lot of money in road construction and rail construction.
But financial shortages have been a challenge to Mr. Joko's government as he approaches the election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from the tekta groups, where many Muslim allies have had conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of recruits transferred to their homes when Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, with swords, you will have arrows and other strong weapons.

Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes a recent reminder to face the 'written history crisis'
His removal will be a right to its destruction similar to Taliban for the art of many religious and British tertiarys carried out by his fanatic allies of the Puritan wing.
But the Cromwell Community described Mr. Crick's proposal as "a clue" and "will answer to re-written history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said: "It would not be inevitable in the current debate regarding the removal of idols as Oliver Cromwell's example outside Westminster Castle would be targeted.
The act of destroying examples in the civil war in England was not ordered or implemented by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad that Cromwell would be blamed for it was the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the last century.
Mr. William Hamo Thorneycroft's interesting representation to Cromwell is a testimony to the 19th century's views and part of the history of a man who many believe still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is honored by many, perhaps more in the 19th century than now, as a parliamentary advocate due to external pressure, which was the source of royal leadership.
Whether all of this is a correct representation in the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is evident is that the mid-century war of the 17th century has laid the basis for the future development of our country and Cromwell is a private person who is recognized to represent a single wing in the opposing groups.
His success as the Watchtower also deserves to be celebrated and celebrated."

Hurricane Rosa was a 85 mph speed wind, Hurricane of Type 1, in 11 a.m. East Hours on Sunday, and appeared 385 miles southwestern of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the atmosphere has begun to take over the Pacific Ocean and headed east to the Western Coast of the United States. With hurricane Rosa approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin pushing tropical moisture to the north in the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 countries of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday
Then, tropical moisture that begins to interfere with the surrounding atmosphere will cause heavy rainfall in the west in the future.
In the interior, the rain of 1 to 4 inches will cause sudden flooding, mud slope and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Much tropical humidity will cause rainfall to 2 to 3 inches per hour in one place, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be the rainfall rate of 2 to 4 inches in the southwestern, especially many parts of Arizona.
A sudden flooding can occur from developing conditions due to tropical rain conditions.
It will be very dangerous to go out in the desert by foot due to the risk of tropical rain.
Much of the rain can cause to be large rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and scattered dust.
The surrounding atmosphere will bring heavy rainfall to some of the South California coasts.
The total rainfall rate of half a country may occur, which can cause a small slope of mud and ski roads.
This will be the first rain in the area in the rainy season.

Over 20 million people watched Bret Kavanaugh's case
Over 20 million people watched a major evidence on Thursday and the selection of the Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh and a woman who is a victim of sexual abuse that is said to occur in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, in six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with broadcasters interrupt regular periods to highlight the final stage of Friday events: a deal carried out by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate for a week on charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that he is 100% sure that Kavanaugh held him in secret places when he was drunk and tried to strip the clothes at the high school ceremony.
Kavanaugh, giving emotional testimony, said he is 100% sure that this did not happen.
There is a possibility that more than 20.4 million people as reported by Nielsen on Friday watched.
The company was counting the average viewing at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Statistics were not immediately available from other networks that aired, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a challenge to count people who watch as an in office.
To keep this in the right perspective, hio is a audience that is sufficient by the audience of the football game or the Studies College Awards.
Fox News, whose referendum administrators have been strongly supported by Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks on an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's case, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second and 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Ham remained up after the case.
Flake was a major topic in Friday's hio case.
After this average Republican official reported that he would be supporting Kavanaugh's appointment, he was trapped by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being struck by the keyists while trying to climb elevator to attend the Court Committee case.
He stood down for several minutes while being scolded, an event shown directly at CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," one woman said.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
He was told, "you're strong when many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had released information and said, before the elevator was closed, that he would have much to say in the committee case.
The broadcasting and cable networks were all focused directly on hours later, while the Court Committee was voting to promote Kavanaugh's appointment for the Senate for full vote.
But Flake said he could do so with the realization that the FBI could investigate claims against the selection in the next week, which the few Domocrats have been arguing.
Flake was somewhat convinced by a conversation with his friend, Sondemocrat Senator. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was strong, because it was clear that the Crepublicans will not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation through FBI on allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has shocked opponents for 'playing politics' in connection with Brexit.
British Prime Minister Theresa May shocked opponents of his plan to withdraw from the European Union for "playing politics" and British scholarship and harassing national interests in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In other interviews near her on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson insisted on his attacks on his plan known as Chequers for Brexit, saying a proposal that the UK and the European Union should collect the tribute of each other is "a empty nonsense."
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police have captured suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for the second rate of murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a battle video between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the war.

After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting the Wayde.
His messages are set into $350,000, Attorney reported.
The East Baton Rouge death investigator released an earlier report on Friday, saying the reason for death is a lead injury in the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police panel, a police criminal laboratory, Southern University police police and local citizens for assisting in an investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU's director Joe Alleva was grateful for the local law-based mother for "the necessity and the implementation of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot player was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played for the LSU basketball team.
He received an average of 5.6 and 2.6 points in the game last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Will Wade basketball team said the team was "very affected" and "a shock" by the death of the Wayde.
"The things like these are the ones who worry at all," said Wade.
Volcano throws ash on Mexico City
The ash launched from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighbors of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Manga Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the operation increased within the crater and recorded 183 times of gas and ashes for over 24 hours.
The station was tracking the roars and many vibrations.
Pictures on social media showed thin ash covering car mirrors in neighboring Mexican city areas such as Xochimilco.
Geologicalists have discovered an increase in operations on a volcano that is available 45 miles ( 720 km) south-east of the capital since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake occurred in central Mexico in September 2017.
Volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police fight against Catalan-based rugbys before the ceremony of freedom of voting
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters fought against protest police while thousands joined the protest protest to commemorate the first year of Katallunya's withdrawal.
A group of protesters wearing puppets who support the restricted police beat them with eggs and threw them on flour, resulting in black clouds of dust on the streets that would usually have many tourists.
Riots also occurred later that day while police use their rods to face fighting.
For more than several hours groups supporting the isolation that said "No forget, no pardon" faced the supporters of the unity who were saying, "The constant struggle."
Four people received treatment for minor injuries found in protests, local media reporting.
Anxiety has remained high in the area that prefers independence a year after the 1 October referendum was considered illegal by the authorities in Madrid but celebrated by the pro-supporters.
Voters widely chose free, although the number of people who appeared as low as those who oppose isolation ignoring the vote in large quantities.
According to the Catalan authorities about 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the area and caused a violent riot.
Free supporters had camped all night on Friday to prevent protests to help national police.
The march continued but had to take a different way.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, a electric technician who attended a breakout protest with his wife said he was no longer hoping for Katallunya's expectations to gain independence.
"Last year we got to live in the best period of life.
I watched my parents happily crying for being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite getting a significant victory despite the very small in the previous regional election in December, the parties supporting Catalan independence have failed to maintain speed in this year with many leaders best known as exile by self-determination or detention waiting for a case for providing a referendum and a later statement of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car technician recording protests supporting police on his phone, said that the conflict had been caused by politicians from both posts.
"The concerns continue to grow further," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial jail since late last year, announced that he would hold a seat in the European Parliament election next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European Parliament election is the best way to refuse to be restored to democratic values and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga's Bao gives Livingston a 1–0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first Goli for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston promoted the ladder surprised Rangers for causing Steven Gerrard's defeat for the second time in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's club was the one that separated the results between both teams while Gary Holt's team moving and holding the second place similar to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains without victory in foreign matches in the Premier League this season and will face leaders Hearts, who are ahead of them with eight points, next Sunday.
Previously, Rangers will be the inhabitants of Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased the number of matches that have not failed to be six in the bridge, where the main coach Holt has not yet failed since taking the place of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lacks a chance against harsh visitors
Holt's team had to be ahead long before closing, with their live attack game causing Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson was able to get a chance but failed to aim for his kjuju passed in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only hit the ball out after he slipped himself to meet the head ball from Craig Halkett.
The locals were not seen by anxiety and allowed Rangers to own a game, knowing that they can trouble visitors with the rugby pras.
And it's in that way where they were able to tie the goal.
Rangers were punished with a rugby and Livingston struggled to find a gap, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined and gave Menga a chance, who touched and scored a score from the middle of the box.
At the time, Rangers had controlled football ownership but failed to penetrate the home team's defence stronghold and the gatekeeper Liam Kelly was not troubled for a long game period,
The style continued in the second period, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save his rugby.
Scott Pittman was prevented from tying the score and feet of the Rangers' gatekeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow landed ball out after another Livingston club.
The attacks continued to hunt the Livingston team box and continued to be removed, while two penalti claims - after Halkett dropped the reserve player Glenn Middleton, and another about holding the ball with hands - was ignored.
'Ajabu' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland at Tony Macaron's field
A wonderful work and good results for Livingston.
In reality, they had a better game and continue to exceed expectations and by continuing to climb up on the jersey.
Their style of playing with the team has not changed significantly since returning to the main league, but many compliments go to Holt in a way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett contributed to the main, well owned the most well-organized defence fort, while Menga gave them operations every time Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the entire match.
Rangers missed the challenge, however.
As they have been good sometimes under Gerrard, they were under those standards.
They missed the last touch in the gate - only once they could create a chance to get a score in the home team's stronghold - and hio is a challenge for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the jersey.
Erdogan gets a different reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met with breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan Germany - which aims to reform relations between the two NATO allies.
They have differed in issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkish reach to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The town is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons as a barrier to the 25,000 crowd not to gather before the mosque, but many supporters appeared in the surrounding areas to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who oppose Erdogan - most of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, scoring Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The two-story protests indicate a division about the view of the president who appears as a hero for some German Turks and the loss of others as a dictator.

Hurricane Rosa Risks Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Suddenly Flood (The Summers Can Benefit)
It is not common for tropical depression from Arizona, but that is exactly what can happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining powers will pass through the West Desert and cause the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Climate Service has already issued a warning of the sudden flooding of Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a direct way on Phoenix on Tuesday and close later Monday with rain.
The National Climate Service in Phoenix has described on Twitter that "10 tropical oaks have maintained storms and low pressure conditions within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona border."
Recent examples of the Hurricane National Center predicts the rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, as well as a few to 6 inches at the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other Western Desert areas including Great Basil's Rockies are likely to get 1 to 2 inches and the possibility of a few to 4 inches.
For those outside the danger of sudden flooding, hurricane rain Rosa may be a blessing because the area is dry.
Although flooding brings great concern, some of these rains can be beneficial because South West are witnessing drought conditions.
According to the American Drought Tracking. More than 40% of Arizona is witnessing at least severe drought, the second high type," the father.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's route leads to the ground through the Mexican Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, still with the power of a hurricane on Sunday morning and the top of 85 miles per hour, is available 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is heading north for 12 km per hour.
The storm is facing water in the Pacific and so its power is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected to reach the ground in Mexico with the power of tropical storms during the day or on Monday evening.
Rain in some parts of Mexico can be a major cause of flooding.
"The rain of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to Sonora in the north west and the possibility of reaching 10 countries," the father.com reported.
Rosa will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the morning as a decline in tropical pressure and then up through Arizona and south of Utah Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected from hurricane Rosa or its remains is a heavy rain in Baja California, north west Sonora, and the North West Sonora Desert and the United States. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Station said.
Rain is expected to cause sudden flooding to threaten life and a slope of mud on deserts and landslides in the mountainous region.

Trump says Kavanaugh 'showed, selfishness and anger' of the Wademokrat
"The death of Justice Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the brutal and terrifying methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has been shown selfishness and anger" of the Democratic Party during all his selection process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Parliament on Thursday, strongly and emotionally rejecting allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused him decades ago when they were young.
Ford also witnessed in a case about the woman's claims.
The President said Saturday that "Americans saw the clever and the quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to prove Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the perfect minds of our times, a lawyer with a good service record for the public," told the crowd of West Virginia.
The President referred to Kavanaugh's appointment in a indirect way when he discussed the importance of Republican supporters to appear to vote in the election of representatives.
"Five from now one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't quarrel, but in another view I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm going around everywhere to strike good debe candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats are willing to "oppose and prevent."
The first key vote of order at the Senati parliament on Kavanaugh's selection is expected to be held before Friday, the main assistant of the GOP leadership has told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in an earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia and the death toll
At least 384 people were killed, many were asked when large waves arrived in fukwe, when a massive earthquake and tsunami shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for festivals on the coast in the city of Palu on Friday when the six-metre waves (29 m) hit land at night and asked many and destroyed and destroyed everything that existed.
Tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still working on the coast and did not immediately run and became affected," Sutopo Purwo Nug Spirit, a spokesman for the disaster prevention agency in Indonesia BNPB said at a meeting with reporters in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come alone, came with cars, logs, houses, affected everything on the ground," said Nug Spirit, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the sea with a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before attacking the coast.
Some people planted trees to avoid tsunamis and saved themselves, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 stations in Palau.
Space photos released by a disaster agency showed many damaged buildings and stores, bridges were overthrown and sank by a water - surrounded mosque.
Small vibrations continued to be heard in the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Tathmini and Technology Use (BPPT) stated in a report that the energy released by a large Friday earthquake was about 200 times as much as it was compared to a atomic bomb that was bombed Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The city's Geography, which is found at the end of a narrow rugby can have caused a tsunami increase, said.
Nug Spirit described the condition of destruction as "pat" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels were destroyed.
. The bodies of some victims were found stuck in the rubble of fallen buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 others were lost.
Nug Spirit said the casualties and destruction may be the largest along the coast of 300 km (190 km) north of Palu, a region called Donggala , which is near the core of the earthquake.
Communication "is completely disabled without any information" from Donggala , Nug Spirit said.
There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that workers and volunteer service providers were heading for affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but it may be worse," it said.
The organization on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that tsunami had attacked Palu , although leaders said the waves arrived shortly after a warning was issued.
In a non-competitive video shared in social media, a man in the upper floor of the building can be heard shouting of tsunami warnings approaching people on the road.
Within minutes the water waves reach the coast and carry buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately confirm this video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused the loss of electricity in a broad area that interrupted contact near Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending freight aircraft and aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the displaced still need food and other basic needs.
The town airport has only been opened with relief efforts and will remain locked until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll From Indonesia's Tsunami Increases over 800.
The Situation Is So Bad.
With World Vision staff from Donggala successfully safely in Palu, where workers protect themselves in tents placed outside their office, they went through the events of great destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they saw many damaged houses" he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even though assistance groups began relief operations, some complained that foreign professional foreign workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesia's laws, money, equipment and foreign workers can only start entering if the disaster announces national.
This has not yet been done.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Alia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government said, "Well, this is a national disaster," we can open to get international help but there is still no situation."
When the second night you fell to the city of Palu after an earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those who were lost were hoping that their loved ones will get up and make it a miracle in their hopeless stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was found from a sewage pipeline.
On Sunday, rescuers saved a woman who had been under rubble for two days and her mother’s body near her.
Gendon Subandono , coach of the national flight team of Iindonesian umbrella, had taught two of the umbrella players who have disappeared for Asian Games, which was completed this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, together Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a leader in the field of umbrella jump, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how, hours after a report about Roa Roa Hotel spread between the community of participants in the umbrella jump game, had sent WhatsApp's message to the Palu competitors, who were participating in the coastal festival.
His message, however, showed one grey mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means that the message was not read," he said.

Kanye West: A rapper artist changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to be - Ye.
Announcing changes on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The official creature known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye's nickname for a time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
These changes occur before his appearance in the Saturday Night Live period, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He takes the position of singer Ariana Grande on a period who regretted "the emotional reasons ," the show producer said.
Despite being a summary of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is a most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the name of his album and radio producer Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It changed from Kanye, which means a special person, and only to be Ye - to be the example of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more like what we are."
He is one of the most popular rappers who changed their names

Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has never promised not to use the army against civilians while the country is about to commemorate 50 years since the bloody murder against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "we will not use the army to deal with the Mexican people."
Armies shot in peace demonstrations in the building on 2 October 1968, killing about 300 people while the left-wing student movement was deeply rooted in South American countries.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youth by providing a monthly grant to students and open unpaid public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double A.I.
While China continues to be more involved in the right mind, the United States should double the amount of money it uses in research in the field of hio, said the investor and the AI expert, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various U.S. government units broadcast about AI, even though the United States generally lacks the official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: and aims to be number 1 in AI's discovery by 2030.
"To double the AI budget will be a good start, due to the situation that all other countries are far behind the United States and we seek new discoveries in AI," Lee said.
Adding double money can increase double opportunities that the next AI success will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: : China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, which has placed in one of the most popular AI companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he formed an AI system that won the Othello player of the U.S. high-class and later became active in Microsoft Research and president of Google branch of China.
Lee agreed that the original U.S. government technology competition as a Roboti Corporation in the Plans for the Deep Defense Research and requested to know when another race would be, to help identify the experts who come to them.
Researchers in the United States often have to do extra work to obtain government aid, Lee said.
"Not China takes professional leaders, are companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired stars from universities to work in AI in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in AI.
"I think green cards should be released directly to PhD students in AI," he said.
The Chinese State Committee issued its Development Program in False Mind in July 2017.
The National dedication of Chinese Natural Science offers funds to people in educational institutions similar to how the dedication of Natural Science and other government agencies provides funds to American researchers, but the quality of professional work is of low level in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Center for Cooperation in False Mind, which aims to associate partners from the sector and academics and White House announced the creation of the Study Committee in False Mind.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next program.
For NSF, it currently offers over $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law that wanted to form the National Security Commission in False Mind has not advanced for months now.
Macedonian voters on the change of the name of the country
The Macedonians voted on Sunday about the change of his name as "North Makedon's Republic," a move that could solve a long-term conflict with Greece that prohibits its request for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has maintained that the name of neighboring countries in the north represents a claim for its province and has opposed the country's request to become a member of NATO and EU.
The two governments reached a consensus in June according to the proposed new name, but national opponents say the change would undermine the tribal recognition of many Sanlvoni people in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a campaign to ignore voting has caused doubts about whether the number of voters will reach a 50% rate required by the referendum as correct.
The question in the referendum reads: "Do you support NATO membership and EU and accept agreement with Greece."
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a suitable bail to be paid to be accepted into organizations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries created from the dissolution of Yugoslavia.
"I've come today to vote for the future of the country, for the Macedonian youth so they can live freely under the European Union umbrella because the hio means a safe life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska at Skopjeje.
Although not legally recognized, sufficient parliamentary members have said they will support the vote results to make them more serious.
The change of the name will require support and two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The country's electoral commission has said that there had no reports of law violations by seven hours of the day.
However, the number of voters was only 16%, compared to 34% in the previous parliamentary election in 2016 while 66% of registered voters voted.
""I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski , 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Macedonia to replace the country's name that will open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, was providing a small platform and organizing seats in front of tents created by those who will oppose the referendum.
"We support NATO and the European Union, but we want to join willingly, not through the rear door under pressure" said Kavadarkov.
"We're a poor country, but we have our honour.
If they don't want to register us as Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia collaboration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the most needed investment for Macedonia, which has a 20% unemployment rate.
"I believe a large number will support because 80% of our citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that the result of "yes" would be "the proof of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research said between 30 and 43% of voters will share in the referendum - under the required level .
Another study, conducted by the Macedonian Telma television , found that 57% of the participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to wash the number of voters should be 50% and one vote.
Failure in the referendum will represent the first major blow to the government's policy based on the West since it took the steering in May last year.

Scherzer wants to be an Arab against. Rockies
With the Nationals already removed from the segregation game, he had no other reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer who has a lot of competition hopes to be a barrier on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a serious impact on Rockies, who are proud to have one game that has not played against Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockies won the chance to play the score match by winning 5–2 against National on Friday night, but still seek the first crown in the bridge.

Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred to indirectly the situation facing his selection Bret Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court when he discussed the importance of Republican sons to appear extensively in the election of representatives.
"All the results we got are at risk in November.
Five weeks from the most important election in our lives.
These are one of the biggest, big elections -- I don't fight but in another view I'm really running and that's why I'm going around all to beat good debes," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible group of the Wademokrat, you see they do right now.
And they have decided to take power by using any possible means, you can see selfishness, debauchery.
They don't care about people who hurt them, who are wrong to gain authority and control, what they want is authority and control, we can't give them."
He said, the Demokrats are willing to "oppose and prevent."
"And you can see it in the past four days," he said, calling the Wademokrats to be the people of "the evil and the wicked and the liars."
He mentioned a member of the Senator Court Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which made the audience grow.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you expose the manuscript in a wrong way?
Uh, uh, what it's.
No, not, I waited one - that was a very weak language of the body - the worst language I've ever witnessed."
The Leba Party is no longer a church.
It does not tolerate free ideas
While Momentum activists in my local party voted to remove me, it was not very strange.
After all, I'm one in the Leba MPs line told that we don't want it - all by saying our thoughts.
My partner in parliament Joan Ryan was similarly treated because he stood up for his rebellion against the discrimination of the certifications.
In my case, the proposal to remove me was shocked by disagreements with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a suitable economic policy, on national security, on the European issue, it is that the issues are similar to what Jeremy differs from the original leaders.
A statement to the Leba meeting in East Nottingham on Friday explained that "we want meetings to be integrated and effective."
For over eight years as a local Leba MP, Friday meetings on GC's night have been fully including it.
Unfortunately today, it was not similar to many meetings and the political promise "low, generous" has long been forgotten if, in fact, it had begun.
It has become more evident that different views are not accepted in the Leba party and all comments are taken well if they are accepted by party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as my partner I thought we were sharing the same political perspective began to expect to change the thoughts completely and take over the positions I would never agree with - whether it is about national security or one market in the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - the following is insulting in social media and efforts to want me not to be elected, I reject middle-wing politics, and tell me that I should not be in the Leba party.
And it's not a situation I've gone through alone.
Indeed, I know I'm more lucky than other colleagues because the comments directed to me are political.
I respect the skills and statements of my colleagues who face sexual abuse or race every day but never give up.
One of the most disappointing things in modern politics is how the standards of abuse are considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Leba should promote a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a church combined with every debate who "missing" or changes in selection principles, the party is more narrow in integration.
I have received a lot of advice over the past two years being urged to settle down, I should not be talking too much and that "I'll be right."
But I didn't get into politics to do so.
Since I joined the Leba 32 years ago as a school student, due to the surprise of being ignored by the Thatcher government that left my full school class almost falling, I have struggled to fight for better public services for those who need them more - whether it is a local councillor or government minister.
I have not hidden my kind of politics, including in the previous election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused about attitude in policy and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
For those who brought forward the debate on Friday, all I'll say is that when the country is about to leave the European Union almarama Brexit, a move that will hurt our family, business and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and power to discuss my loyalty to the Leba party leader.
But really one of my messages are not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to the citizens in my area, whether members of the Leba or not: I am proud to serve and I promise that there is no amount of threats to be eliminated or political disorientation will prevent me from considering what I believe is for the best interests for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's team that has not been washed still takes the first place on the jersey
Two attempts in the last time may have changed to some extent the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr qualified to win in this most anticipated match of the Tennent League.
Now they lead the jersey, the only team that has not failed.
Eventually, it was their best protection , and the use of their positions, which helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had the right to be satisfied.
"We've been tried in our games so far, and we're still not defeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Hongera to Ayr, they used their best positions to be replaced."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, closed by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr forward, but a yellow card for the Scottish team player Rary Hughes, released for the game with Warriors, allowed Melrose to use the opportunity to have many players and Jason Baggot got to close an experiment that was not closed.
Climo added Ayr's leadership to a penalti, just before the break, scored and then completed the experiment alone and made the score 17–5 to Ayr during the break.
But Melrose started well the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, closed by Baggot, reducing leadership by five points.
The game was then suspended for a while after a dangerous injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was removed being carried by the game when it was re-established, Ayr added his leadership to Stafford McDowall's attempt, closed by Climo.
Kaimu captain of Ayr Blair Macpherson and was then given a yellow card and again, Melrose used the position to have one more player and closed with Bruce Colvine's attempt , at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team took control again, however, while Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for playing for Climo without ball and from a penalti line out, MacPherson scored due to a severe attack from Ayr.
Clili scored, how he was doing after the game started again, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's rugby and to hang Gregor Henry and shut down the fifth attempt to the home team.

''The Sea is ours': Bolivia that has no port hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific sea
The patrols at the marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have laid a blue flag like the sea.
Sea stations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon have been written in terms: "The sea is ours in justice.
To restore it is duty."
Throughout Bolivia without port, the memory of the coastal zone that lost Chile in the 19th century resource crisis is still clear - just as the desire to travel again in the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps that hope is currently the highest for many years, with Bolivia awaiting the decision of the international justice court on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia is fast, a spirit of unity and quiet and really has the prospect of a positive attitude effectively," said Roberto Calzadilla , Bolivian diplomat.
Most of Bolivian citizens will look at ICJ's decision on a large screen across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will make a decision that accepts Bolivia's claims - after decades of appropriate conversation - Chile will be forced to discuss the move to reach the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's natural president - who faces a heated confrontation in re-election next year - also has much about Monday decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he swore in late August.
But other critics believe that a court is less likely to make a decision that is appropriate for Bolivia - and that there will be very little changes even if it decides.
The Dutch-based organization has no authority to sell Chile to other countries, and has said it cannot determine the results of the expected conversation.
ICJ's decision will be issued only six months after the final debate indicates that the "not complex," said Paz Zárate , Chilean expert in international law.
And besides promoting Bolivia's hopes, four years ago may have turned it back.
"The issue of sea reaching is exploited by the current Bolivian regime," said Zárate .
Morales' political words have finished the remaining good intentions of Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some time will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to make discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé , a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were very fast.
Monday will give Bolivia "a remarkable search to open a new era of relationship with Chile" and the opportunity to "stop 139 years of difference for common benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - is still one of the most popular presidents in South America - was using the sea issue as a political course.
"Bolivia will never give up for his right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is the chance to realize that we need to go ahead."
North Korea says that nuclear removal will not be possible unless it has faith with the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never remove his nuclear weapons first if it cannot be trusted with Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made during a meeting in Singapuri between opposition leaders.
His opinion comes as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be about to re-establish nuclear diplomacy that had not been successful for over three months after the Singapuri conference with North Korean president Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a small step" that promoting restrictions and opposition to the US for a report ending the Korean War will ever make the North weak.
Washington is afraid to accept information without Pyongyang first to do important measures to remove weapons.
Kim and US President Donald Trump all want a second meeting.
But there is a great doubt that Pyongyang considers the action to remove the weapons that the country considers as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to host the second Kim-Trump meeting.

The hard-making hats have attracted many in Instagram in this summer and these designers have released these beautiful caps to be used on the fashion platform.
Valentino's most impressive version was a brown hat set on broad banks similar to fur that covered the heads of the model.
Other major devices include ticket models, witch hat and even pineapples - but are not designed to give your head warm.
Thom Browne also exposed strange landlands - in time Halloween is approaching.
Many colored Continents had lips made and resemble Hannibal Lecter than fashion skills
One design was similar to the skyuba refugee device with a chip and glasses, sometimes similar to the melting ice cream koni.
And if you continue with a big fashion report - you're lucky.
Fashion viewers predict that large netes can be on the way to the luxury stores near you.
A very large hat gives design in 'La Bomba', a straw hat with two-speed edges and leads everyone to wear it from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.

Popular fashion expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see a large hat and a pinbag bags coming to the stores next summer - because the architect has brought a significant effect that would be difficult to ignore the needs of large materials.'
John Edward: Language knowledge is important to international citizens
The Scottish independent schools continue to maintain a record of professional skills and this has continued in 2018 for another set of best test results, which are strengthened by personal and collective success in sports, art, music and other social efforts.
Despite the increase of over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools in Scotland (almaraa SCIS), are working to provide a better service level for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to provide their students with more and higher education, the professions they choose and their position as international citizens.
As a education sector that can create and implement a special school course, we see modern languages continue to be popular and preferred in school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in the language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language that nature goes to his heart."
This is a vital reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build a relationship with faith with people from other countries.
Due to the recent results of this year's test, we can see that languages lead the league jersey with high standards in independent schools.
A total of 68% of foreign-language students received a top sign of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72% of students received a top A symbol in Kimandarini and 72% for those studying German, 69% for those studying French and 63% of Spanish students also found A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important knowledge that children and young people will need in their future.
Languages now, as a choice lesson, are taken to the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and other places.
A study by the British Commission in Ajira and Skills in 2014 found that one of the reasons employers said they find when they have a challenge to fill jobs, 17% were associated with lack of language knowledge .
So more and more, language knowledge becomes important to provide young people with their later professions.
With many jobs required language, this knowledge is important in the world of globalization.
Regardless of the profession one chooses, if they have learned the second language, they will have the most real place in the future to have a knowledge of life like this.
Having the ability to communicate directly with foreign people will place someone speaking languages ahead in competition.
According to YouGov's study of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak foreign language well to develop talks in French which is the only language spoken by a percentage of two figures, 15%.
This is why investing in language training is now important to current children.
Having many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a good chance to get a meaningful job.
Within Scotland, each school will have a different language that teaches.
Several schools will focus on more modern languages, where others will teach languages that seem to be more important to Britain in the future to 2020, such as Kimandarrin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be several languages to choose in independent schools, as well as training experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools volunteer to provide a learning environment that will provide children and give them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of their later professions.
It cannot be challenged that this time, in the state of international trade, that languages remain very important for the future, so this should be shown in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "International communication knowledge."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, contrast to quality for the Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Council of Independent Schools in Scotland

The waiting time is about to end with fans eager to see LeBron James playing the first match as Los Angeles Lakers player.
Lakers Luke Walton coach has announced that James will play a pre-final match on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is still unclear how many minutes he will play.
"It would be more than a minute and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers' writer Mike Trullel described in tweet that James can play a few minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in Lakers' schedule "six pre-final games.
"I don't need games before the season at this stage of my game to be ready," he said.
Trump's Political Conference in West Virginia, YouTube Centre
Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign meetings this night in Wheeling, West Virginia.
You will be the first of five meetings that are scheduled to take place next week, including standing in areas where he has many supporters including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote to prove if it is still suspended about the one who appointed him to fill the position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support in the election as the Crepublicans are in danger of losing Parliamentary control while the vote will be played in November.
How long will Trump's meeting in West Virginia be and how can you look online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 1 p.m. East hours tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia conference online through direct flow on YouTube.
There is a possibility Trump will discuss the case that will take place this week about the selection of the Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh, which has brought much concern about the charges of sexual abuse that led to a temporary suspension of the Senate evidence for a week when the FBI is investigating.
But the goal of this meeting pick is to beat debe the Crepublican candidates in the November election to gain more popularity.
Therefore, the President Trump campaign committee said these five meetings in the next week aims to strengthen volunteers and supporters while the Crepublican party trying to protect and expand the majority of seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Senate control is important for his agenda so the president will travel in as many states as possible as we approach the season of more campaign operations," a spokesman for Trump's campaign committee who refused to be recognized told Reuters.
Planned to be held on Wesbanco in Wheeling, this night meeting can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh media broadcasting," according to West Virginia's Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump has visited West Virginia, a state that won over 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the research vote.
"It is not a good sign for Morrison that the president must arrive to try to improve his position in the election," said Simon Hader, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder 2018 Cup: American team shows a fight and maintain hope heading for one man's game on Sunday
After three sessions on one side, two players' game for two Saturday afternoon can be a thrill that Ryder Cup needs
The motion of the wave of the timazi is the most designed concept of sports but which players believe the truth and even more in such competitions
So they will say where the speed is going now?
"They had a six-point leadership and now it's four, so we take it as a little speed I think," said Jordan Spieth after concluding the day.
Europe has a better chance, of course, they are ahead and four points, remaining twelve of the struggle.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have extra power and have a lot of encouragement, also considering the Spieth and Justin Thomas game who played together all day and each boasts three of the four points.
Spieth has been dangerous from the start of the game to the game hole and leads as a role model.
The numerous celebration noises increased as his turn continues, importing the ball after hitting the ball towards the hole and balancing when he and Thomas were down with two points after two turns.
His ball beat towards the hole won the 15-speed match and found a lot of noise to celebrate, which shows you he believes that the American team is still not dead.
"You must really work hard and consider your own match," Spieth said.
Now that's just what these players have left to do now.
18 holes wait for them to show this.
The only players with more marks than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a mysterious story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange pair from Europe has four points out of four and have not made any mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only pair that did not hit the ball more times on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided playing ball more times on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The quality, and how their powers seem to increase between them and the crowd show that the players will give the highest competition on Sunday and probably no other popular players can win for Europe the day when it ends in Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
Vyema if all do so at the same time in different holes.
It's very early to discuss the victory for Europe, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson faced the right way with Sergio Garcia, a morning hero in the two game against two, when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
The extra ball and two more balls in the first nine holes placed Spanish and Swedish in a situation that was difficult from.
Sunday, however, nobody can kill you in the situation you will get involved.
The two game against two is very exciting to watch closely due to the collaboration between pairs, advice they offer, advice that does not have how strategy can change immediately.
Europe has made the best as a team so far and takes a major lead towards the last day but this pair period against a pair has also shown that the American team has a fight that some, especially in the United States, questioned.
Europe leads to 10–6 at Ryder Cup on the last day
Europe will have a good place on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning in a pair match and four balls for 10–6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game twice against Tiger Woods who seemed to be overwhelmed and brought the total of their marks to date on Le Golf National as four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, struggling to pray with the tournament that lost in Hazeltine two years ago, led the United States that seemed to be overwhelmed in the four morning balls game, winning 3–1 series.
The United States released more resistance in pairs matches against pairs and won two matches, but they were unable to remove the shortage.
Jim Furyk team requires eight points from 12 Sunday matches to pray with the shell.
Fleetwood is the first new player in Europe to win four consecutive points while he and Molari, called "Molliwood" after the end of the exciting week they became the second pair only to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating the woods and Patrick Reed in a four-speed match they shared well and won Wood and American Bryson Dechambeau for 5 and 4.
Woods, who was back in both Saturday matches, showed good game sessions but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in a four-speed match and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who rested with a four-yard match in the morning, returned to cooperate with Henrik Stena in a pair match and 2 and 1 and Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - listed in the first and third place in the world.
Europe did not get everything though the day was beautiful, with a spectacular wind in southwestern Paris.
The winner of the main Cup Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a model for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won the 2 and 1 win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-speed match and later won Poulter and Rary McIlroy 4 and 3 in a pair game after losing the first two holes.
It is only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup where the team has managed from behind with four points to one man's game, although the Furyk team only needs from uniform to pray with the shell.
After being in second place for two days, however, the winning struggle on Sunday seems to be far away from them.
North Korea says 'impossible' will remove weapons without believing that others will do what they should.
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was further undermined from believing in the United States and no way the country could remove its nuclear weapons without others to do what they should be under such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual United Nations General Conference that North Korea had taken "good action of good intentions" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, breaking the nuclear test station and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any similar answer from the United States," he said.
"Without any belief from the United States there will be no trust in our national security in such a situation and there is no way we will first remove our weapons without others to do what they should."
While Ri again insisted on North Korea's complaints regarding Washington's "step" strategy by removing nuclear weapons where North Korea would find a small move, his report seemed important as it did not refuse to remove nuclear weapons on terms how Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint report by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the current United States President and North Korean leader Singapuri on June 12, while Kim promised to work to "take nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure North Korean security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal solution to the 1950–53 Korean war, but the United States says Pyongyang must first remove its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected a call to stop international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists" first the removal of nuclear weapons" and increases the pressure rate using restrictions to reach their goal by forcing and even opposing "the final declaration of war," Ri said.
"The point that obstacles may not weaken is an impossible dream from people who ignore us.
But the problem is that ongoing obstacles promote distrust.
"Ri did not mention plans for the second meeting between Kim and Trump which the US leader hinted at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead reflected three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If an ally in this matter of removing nuclear syllables would be South Korea and not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula would not be in this bad situation."
However, Ri's speech was somewhat different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the move to target the United States mainland and North Korean rockets would not be inevitable after "Bw. Evil President" Trump referred to Kim as a "man of rocket" with the aim of implementing murder.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking action to remove weapons, but said a great task should still be done and restrictions should pray until North Korea removed nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a specific time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia say that the United Nations Security Council should take over Pyongyang in action.
However, the U.S. Secretary of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue in detail and without failing until we can complete, final and proven nuclear weapons."
Together, the Security Council has increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to eliminate funds for nuclear plans and Pyongyang missiles.
Pompeo met Ri after the United Nations General Assembly later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip was not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress has been made, but only within several hours North Korea was shocked by giving "masharti as a criminal."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy the missile station and also a nuclear weapon station if the United States takes "related action."
He said Kim had told him that the "related steps" he wanted was a security guarantee Trump promised as Singapuri and towards strengthening relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught a lesson in getting enough rest.
A new lesson at Harvard University this year requires all undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to fight the culture of pretending to be confused and read for 'all days' with coffee assistance.
‘ The experts discovered students at the university number one in the world are ignorant about the basic issue of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and expert at Brigham Hospital and Women, formed the subject, which he believes is the first type in the United States.
. He was given a goal to create a lesson after giving a speech about how insufficient sleep affects training.
'At the end of the speech, one girl came to me and said: 'Why am I just told these things now, in my last year?"
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The lesson, which has been first established this year, describes students with basic aspects of how good sleep style helps in professional and sports activities and also improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of intelligence at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of university health care, said that the university decided to establish the subject after discovering that students had been very asleep in the week.
The entire hour-long lesson involves a series of activities.
In one place there is a picture of the bedroom, where students press for coffee, curtains, shoes and books and described about the effects of coffee and light and how sports activities are affected by sleeplessness and the importance of sleep schedule.
In other places, participants are told how long sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, fatigue and cancer.
A college map and a co-operation, then urges participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know the subject will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the damage to health when you smoke, 'Profesa Czeisler added.
The proud culture in 'the watch' is still present, he said, adding that modern technology and pressure on growing students mean sleeplessness was a continuing problem.
To ensure that you get enough sleep, with good quality, you should be the student's 'secret weapon' to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding weight, because sleeplessness makes it in a state of discontent and making you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who learns physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to form a subject, after participating in one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said the lesson opened his eyes and gave him a desire to create a whole college class.
The next step, hopes, is to request all graduating students to do a corresponding lesson before joining a highly competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider putting a sleeping bell and also a time bell to wake up and understand the damage of the 'white light' provided by electric screens and LED lights, which can damage the brain clock and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's Bao hangs Gerrard's youth
Rangers were again defeated in another foreign game while Dolly Menga's rugby was stolen the Steven Gerrard team that seemed to be overwhelmed by 1–0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was intended to win the first foreign victory since the 4–1 win against St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager and leaving his team eight points behind the Ladbrokes League leaders, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break with Rangers never seemed to be balanced.
While Rangers are now descending to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and are just behind Hibernian in the difference of the gogo.
And there may be more problems for Rangers after the boxer Calum Spence needs treatment after being injured in the head for something aired from Rangers' supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team which closed Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used all 11 players who got uniforms against Hearts last week and will be pleased with how his well-organized team faced their opponents all the time.
Rangers owned more ball but Livingston took advantage of their positions when they got a ball.
They were to close only the second minute when Menga's first ball gave Scott Pittman to the gate of Allan McGregor but the link threw the ball out.
The club ball from Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his partner in defence Alan Lithgow was able to just beat it out of the goal.
Rangers took control but their game seemed only faith but not confidence when they approached the closing area.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he would have to get a penalti 15th minute after being hit by Steven Lawless but refer Steven Thomson said the game continued even after the coach's claim.
Rangers were able to beat two hits in the goal during the first half but the former Ibrox Liam Kelly gate was not very troubled by the headball from Lassana Coulibaly and weak kwaju from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's goal in the 34th minute was not based on a regular game, no one can refuse to qualify for the victory.
Again Rangers failed to deal with the rugby ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher infiltrated the ball Scott Robinson, who was strong and played ball towards Menga who touched and closed.
Gerrard made a decision during the break and changed Coulibaly and Ryan Kent and the hio action was almost effective when the link infiltrated the ball Morelos but Kelly ran from his place and prevented the ball.
But Livingston continued to disrupt visitors and made them play how they wanted, with Lithgow and Halkett playing a long ball after another.
Holt's team could add the goal in the last minutes but McGregor was stable and prevented Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball out of the head.
Rangers Glenn Middleton's savings player had other penalti claims in the last minutes when they faced Jacobs but again refa Thomson ignored a request away.
Year's Shajara: The Discovery of Geiger County
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and continued to be in the day when later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" when Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger created a way to detect and measure radiation, a discovery that eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger County.
The basis of science since then, Geiger County began to be popular in the culture of popularity as well, as in the 1950 "Bell of Coronado," which included scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that in this world?"
Rogers: "It's the Counter Geiger, used to detect the mineral of the flies, such as the yuranim.
When you put these head materials, you can hear the effects of atoms provided by the mineral analysis."
Evans: "Say, it's starting to sound now!"
Hans "Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63th birthday.
But the discovery called by his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system 'see' bad cell
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system 'see' bad cells and kill them
Vaccination teaches the immune system to identify bad cells as part of treatment
The technique involves drawing immune cells from the patient, changing them into the laboratory
Then they can 'see' a protein that is popular in many cancers and then re-established.
Experimental vaccines show good results in patients with various cancers.
One woman treated by vaccines, which teaches the immune system to identify the bad cell, was able to be treated for her ovari cancer for over 18 months.
This method involves drawing immune cells from the patient, changing them in laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein for many cancer called HER2, and then place the cells again.
. Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Saratan Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very credible vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovari, lungs and gut and puru, Prof Berzofsky explained.
Such a method of taking immune cells from patients and "education" how to aim cancer cells has worked in treating leukemia.
Kanye West Has started the Ndefu With the Pain of Supporting Trump, Wearing the MAGA Kofi, After appearing in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye Kanye West was named in the studio during the Saturday Night Live period after a high-profile show where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he could hold office in 2020.
After the show of his third song for that night, called Ghost Town where he was wearing a hat written in Make America Great, began to rebuke the Wademokrats and promised support for Trump.
"When I often talk to the white man says: "How can you love Trump, he racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism I would leave the United States too long ago," he said.
SNL's show began with short performances involving Matt Damon where the Hollywood star mocked Bret Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on allegations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the incident was not announced, West's words content was uploaded on social media by comedy Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West for the publication.
West had also complained about the audience that he had a difficult time before entering the stage regarding his hat.
"They treated me badly behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go there with the hat.'
They abused me!
And then they said I'm in a situation I've sunk," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see the sinking place?" saying that he will wear my brave hero's hat, because this means you can't tell me what I'm right to do. You want the world to go ahead?
Try love."
His comments were threatened at least twice from the audience and SNL staff who appeared to be embarrassed, the Variety Station reported, and one person there reporting the publication: "The entire account went completely silent."
West had been brought to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former lover, Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West surprised many when he sang the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who published tweet: "To one of the most brave people: ASANTE FOR KIMMA AND UMMA."
But the host of the conversation session Karen Hunter published tweet that West was just "shows her attitude and that it is absolutely good."
"But I choose to call for someone else (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "season") who I believe agrees and spread a belief that is dangerous to my society.

HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the population of citizens who live with HIV and Aids.
Over 820,000 people are infected in the country, health leaders say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Many of the new events were caused by sex, and marked changes from the past.
The HIV usually spread rapidly in other parts of China due to blood exchange.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had dropped to the spuri, Chinese health leaders said at a meeting in the Yunnan region.
. However, year after year, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is a tough issue in the LGBT community in China.
The same-sex love in China was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is said to be very high.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70–90% men in same-sex love eventually kill women.
Many disease infections come from the immunity during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access to all HIV drugs as part of an effort to deal with this issue.
Maxine Waters denies that his employee revealed the data of the GOP senators, scolded 'a dangerous lie' and 'the theories of plot'
U.S. MP Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that his employee published a personal description of three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
The Demokrat MP from Los Angeles said that allegations were being spread by analysts and "a tough right-wing supporters".
"The lie, lies, and more meaningless lies," Waters said in a report on Twitter.
The comments given are allegedly including home addresses and American senators' phone numbers Masena Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The explanation was seen online Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the Senate panel to hear charges of sexual abuse against the selection of the Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh.
The analysis occurred shortly after the senators had shocked Kavanaugh.
The conservative areas such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that recognizes the source of publications was associated with the Waters office and commented by the Waters worker, Hill reported.
"These unfounded claims are totally false and misleading, "The Waters continued.
"My worker - whose identity, his personal explanation, and safety have been affected by these allegations of fraud and lies—was never involved in exposing this explanation.
These unfounded claims are absolutely false and completely misleading."
Waters' report was quickly used online, including former news Minister at the White House Palace Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he has no control of the right feeling to become the Commissioner of Parliament.
When a person is used for something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He should not worry.
He should not question the purpose of the servant.
He should be calm and insecure.
"Fleischer appeared as comparing Waters' response to the Democratics' criticism against Justice Kavanaugh, who was used by critics by appearing angry during the trial hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, candidate through the Republican party who wants to remove Waters from the representatives' election, also published his ideas on Twitter.
"The big thing if it's true," he said to tweet.
In his report, Waters said his office had declared "the right authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false claims.
"We will make sure that those who have done this matter are exposed, "he continued," and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that destroy and danger to everyone and all my employees."
A survey of Johnny English Stringes Again - joke at Rowan Atkinson's weak spy
It is common to look at Brexit's impact in any new film based on England but that is not used in another comedy-war film for Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned again in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Will the humor of personal joke in the subject of how reckless we'll be a new opportunity abroad?
At any rate, Johnny English's eye-season, a very moving face has a license to make mistakes again in a second time—the name shows his further sign that he has been designed with a broad sense of humor for non-speaking English people.
He is actually a chizi spy who despite the strange claims for interesting attraction shows Clouseau's qualities, the qualities of Mr Bean and the person who contributed one of the Chariots of Fire in the Olympic opening ceremony in London 2012.
He was initially involved as a traveller and a strange international man Atkinson at one time was involved in Barclaycard TV's forgotten TV broadcasts for now, leaving many if they have not been interested.
There is one or two things in this recent film of JE.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter wearing a traditional arms suit and rafadha flats changing for a while on his hat.
Atkinson's album in physical comedy was manifest here, but humor seems to be low and unnecessary, now because the "great" film such as 007 and Mission Impossible include humor as part of it.
The humor seems to be targeting children and not adults and farewell to me the unique trips of Johnny English is not a beans and treasure how the humor of Atkinson's silent films as a character Bean.
The annual concept is now that England is in great trouble.
An online raider has been able to enter the British web network and expose the identity of all British spies outside at work and surprise a fan at work - unfortunately was a very simple role for Kevin Eldon.
In his last time as a proud prince and faces many opposition and has already been completely affected in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing very well for his character corresponding to Teresa May but the story does not help him show these qualities.
His security advisors let him know that because the identity of each detective has been exposed, he must use a retired person.
And that means using Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a school teacher in a prestigious school, but teaches informal training about how to be a secret spy: some of the good humor there, while English teaches detectives similar to the School of Rock.
English is restored to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and merged with former partner Bough, re-released by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, associated with the ship commander, a thrilling position where Vicki Pepperdine has not been involved.
Thus the characters corresponding to Batman and Robin but by destroying things in the Kingdom Secret Ministry are returning to work and in accordance with Olga Kurylenko who plays as Ophelia Bulletinova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister seems to be more involved in the biwanye spy who claims he can solve all the problems of technology in the UK: Jason Volta, who is fired by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their most enjoyable trip : they pretend to hotel ministers, fire in a French luxury restaurant; they start riot and enter without permission in Volta's grand boat; and English causes kasheshe as he tries to use improved Reality tools to learn the interior of the Volta boat.
All rest has certainly been removed for the final sequence, but regardless of the combined influences and turmoil, there are so many qualities of children's periods in the film hio.
Good forewear.
And just as it is with other Johnny English films I had to sell them again: Can the British film sector not give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice for his talent?
The Leba denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days but be paid for five days.
The Leba led by Jeremy Corbyn will consider the strict deal that the British will work four days for wiku - but be paid five days.
The party is allegedly wanting corporate leaders to pay the money saved through the artificial intelligence (AI) to the staff by giving them an extra day.
It will bring the workers to grow up with three days of rest - but they will still go home with the same income.
Sources said that the idea was 'fair' the party's economic agenda and plans to strengthen the country for workers.
Working four days a week has been supported by the Labour Union Center as a means of workers to take over the changing economy.
The main source of the Leba Party told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not be done immediately but four working days are ari corresponding to the party's perspective in balancing the economy for workers and also the party's general strategy for the sector.'
'The Leba will not be the first to recommend such an idea, the Green Party promised four days of work for a week during its 2017 campaign for the general election.
Ari hio is currently not supported by all in the Leba Party, however.
The Leba Party spokesman said: 'four days of work for a week are not party policy and has not been considered by the party.'
Alternative Chansela John McDonnell used the last week's Leba meeting to describe his experiences of the Soviet revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he had a resolution to remove power from the 'unappearers' and 'rich' in service companies.
The alternative Chansela's plan also means that the current staff in water companies will not be able to return all their money because the Leba Government can make 'the loss' on the grounds of recognized errors.
He also confirmed that plans to keep workers on company boards and create the Finance of the Jumuish ownership to provide 10% of private companies' funds for employees, who will have the opportunity to get an annual assignment to €500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy describes the "60 minutes" if FBI investigation against Kavanaugh can change their ideas
The FBI investigation in charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote in connection with its appointment in the Supreme Court for at least a week and raise a question if the FBI results can change the ideas of Republican senators to support them.
In an interview announced on Sunday, a "60Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Senators.wa Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI can find anything that could cause them to change their ideas.
Kennedy seemed more open than his partner from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said towards the case, I said, I've talked to Justice Kavanaugh.
"I called him after this happened, when the allegations came out, I said, 'Did you do it?"
He was firm, wise and accurate."
However, Graham's vote seems to be unchanged.
"I've decided about Bret Kavanaugh and will take a very severe charge," he said.
"Dk. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly refused, "Graham added, meaning Christine Blasey Ford."
"And everyone involved could not prove.
It's 36 years now.
I don't see something new to change."
What Is the World Citizen Festival and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizens Festival, a music event that includes a fascinating list of stars singing as well as the same interesting message; ending poverty in the world.
Now in his seventh year, the World Country Festival will lead to tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn in Central Garden not only to enjoy stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also increase awareness to the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which said in 2012 that it is the continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international defense group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people facing directly against it.
To get a free ticket of the event (except if you would like to pay the VIP ticket), the concert supporters should complete a series of operations, or "acts" such as self-dependent, send emails to the world leader, call or any other efforts to help increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how has the World Civil Festival been successful if it remained 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of scoring people for free festival tickets is a real way to persuade people to push action, or just another case known as "a mere online activism " - people feel if they bring a real difference by signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the World Civil Festival says it has hired over 19 million "acters" from its supporters to different goals.
It says these actions have urged world leaders to declare promises and policies corresponding to $37 billion that will change the lives of over 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group showed 390 promises and advertisements based on its actions, at least $10 billion already distributed or deserted.
The group estimates the money available so far as having directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
Some key promises include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and donors in the United Kingdom aimed at "help children reach all their potential," promising to give 35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,,700 tweet from World Citizens.
"With help from the British government, philanthropists, national governments, and World Citizens like you, we can make social injustice to be only history," Power Ambassador to Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also said that after over 5,000 actions were completed in asking the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and better nutrition.
In response to a question in the section of Questions and Answers on his website that asked "I'm making you think we can end extreme poverty?"
World Citizens' Festival responded: It will be a long and hard way - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, with human rights activists and groups against racism before us, we will succeed, because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is one of the stars who will sing in the event in New York, which the locals will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy to "stop" Russian external energy sales - Minister of Interior
Washington may "if needed" to use its Navy to prevent Russian energy sold, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has said, as described by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's participation in Syria - especially, where it works with a legal government invitation - it is an excuse to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they be the Middle East is to find energy markets how they do in eastern Europe, in southern Europe," reportedly said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and strategies to deal with it.
"University has that capacity, along with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes have been opened, and, if necessary, prevent, to ensure that their energy is not reaching the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing members who attended the event provided by the Users Energy League, a non-profit group that says it represents "the voice of energy users" in the United States.
He continued to compare the ways Washington uses to be inducted with Russia and Iran, saying that the countries are similar.
"The economic crisis for Iran and Russia is, according to use and changing oil," he said, referring to Russia as "with little knowledge" and the economy based on coal oil.
The reports arrive at the time when Trump's regime has been in the mission to increase its natural gas sales to Europe and replace Russia, which has been a very cheap option for European users.
As a result, Trump's administration leaders, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfair" project of "Nord Stream 2," which according to Trump, made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 billion, which aims to double the current capacity of 110 billion volumes, is only an economic project.
Kremlin says that most of Washington's opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and is an example of unjust competitions.
"I believe we agree that energy is not appropriate to be a pressure tool and that users should be able to choose sales," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been used by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German governing organization in the sector, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has wanted the United States to abstain from the European Union energy policy and two-state contracts between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chansela Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Sarah Palin will come with stress caused by a terrifying event for Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being registered in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence Monday night.
"When my son goes through, what he goes through after returning, I can understand other families that are going through the effects of stress caused by some of the effects our soldiers return to, "he told the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

18 states, DC supports new immigration policy
Eight states and Columbia District support law resistance to a new American policy that rejects refuge for victims fleeing crime or domestic abuse.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a small report of a friend-of-the-season on Friday in Washington to support seeking refuge in opposition to policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainer in Grace v. against Sessions which was presented by the United States Civil Freedom Union held in August against the policy of the country has not been exposed.
He said his lover "and his sons members of the criminal group," persecuted him but American officials refused his refuge request on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Supporters of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which provide a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations facing the problems of criminal groups and domestic abuse.
A new refuge policy in the United States changed the 2014 decision with the Immigrant Ruga Board that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic abuse to refuge.
Columbia District Attorney Karl Rine said in Friday's report that new policy "is ignoring decades of state law, country and international."
"The law of the country needs that all asylum claims are determined according to the facts and specific situations of claims, and the refusal violates the principle," said the friend-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the
More lawyers said in reports that a policy prohibiting immigrants from entering affects the American economy, saying they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and "to provide important services."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to provide refuge for victims who fled domestic abuse and criminal groups in June.
"The refuge is available to those fleeing their country due to bullying or fear due to race, religion, nation, or membership in a group of society or political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement about the policy.
The action to provide refuge was not intended to solve all the problems - even all the major problems—which people face every day around the world.
Many rescue efforts in Palu while the number of disasters doubled in the race for survivors,
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It seems very bad," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her fever child at the rescue center in Palu.
"Every minute ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is not readily available."
"The workers seemed returning to their damaged houses, taking water-watered materials, trying to save anything they can get.
Hundreds of people were injured while hospitals, destroyed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, having failed to control the number of patients.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and shoulder, when they buried him outside the Palu Army Hospital , where patients were being treated out due to the continuation of later tremors.
Tears filled his eyes as he recited how a severe earthquake shook the room in the fifth floor of the hotel where they had his wife and daughter.

I drank in walls rubble, I think, " Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for wedding.
"I heard my wife cry with help, but then he became silent.
I don't know what happened to him with my child.
I hope you're safe."
U.S. ambassador to China's 'disguence' through 'the propaganda'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page announcement in the American and Chinese newspaper that reflected the combined benefits of the American and Chinese trade, the US ambassador to China shocked Beijing using American journalists to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump Week ago referred to an extension of China Daily's scholarship in Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa State - after a search for an intervention of the U.S. delegation's election on November 6, claims that China has opposed.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US election shows what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's fast-season campaigns to push China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to set up advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently facing in business wars that have caused an increase in the tax rate of each other's products.
Chinese revenge in early business was designed to affect foreign dealers from states such as Iowa that supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, United States ambassador to UChina and former governor of Iowa, the main supplier of UChina foreign products, said Beijing had a negative impact on American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in a referendum in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now reduces the injustice by putting propaganda ads on independent media."
"In distributing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a way that has been sponsored by the United States of freedom of opinion and free information by posting paid ads on Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In comparison, in parts of the newspapers in the streets in Beijing, you will find very few voices express opposition and you will not be able to see the real situation and different views that the Chinese people may have about the difficult goals of Chinese economy, considering that the media are closely controlled by the Communist Party of China, "written.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what magazine.
Republican Separates Women's Kuras Toward the House of Representatives by Using Kavanaugh Crisis, A Wran Analysis
With many supporters defending the selection in the Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh in facing several allegations of sexual abuse, critics have warned that they will get bad results, especially from women, during the election of representatives.
The feelings around this have been very high and many of the most Crepublicans clearly showed that they wanted to continue the vote.
These factors cannot be returned, "Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he is concerned that the last time pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for FBI investigation would be enough to be present for voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they don't forget tomorrow and even all November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman for the MoveOn's development group said on Friday, according to Washington DC.
Friday morning, protesters sang "November coming!" when they marched on the Senate highway when the Crepublicans who have confirmed the Court Committee when they chose to continue and be appointed to Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The influence and motivation of the Democrats have exceeded expectations", "Stu Rothenberg, an independent political critic, told the news website.
"People say it has already reached a high level; that's true.
But it may be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and small voters, aged 18 to 29, who while not interested in president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public evidence described sexual abuse against the Supreme Court's selection, critics said the bad consequences could follow if the NajRepublicanists will continue and confirm.
"This has been a mud game for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Council of the Crepublican in the past week, according to NBC News.
"Not only about the committee vote or final vote or if Kavanaugh will be appointed, it is also about the way the Crepublicans have dealt with this and how they treated him ," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps select the Wademokrats, has said at the news station.
However, Americans seem to have a division about who is trustworthy after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with many leaning on Kavanaugh.
New research from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the participants are clear or perhaps believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said it was obvious or perhaps believed in Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh in a clear sense or perhaps lied during his testimony, while only 30% have said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI currently explores the allegations made by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford witnessed before the Senati Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh persecuted him at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that the Grand Court's Selected revealed his secret parts while attending the ceremony while attending the ceremony in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Explorer Plans to Start New Internet to Fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of World Wide Web, launchs a new business that will offer competition against Facebook, Amazon and Google
The recent project of the technological, Inrupt, is a company that is designed through the Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and people allowed to obtain permission to reach the explanation.
In a special interview with Fast, Berners-Lee claimed that Inrupt's purpose is "ruled the world."
"We should do it now," he said about business.
"It's a historic time."
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create "the storage of personal data online" or POD.
It can include a list of communication, a list of things to do, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Archive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on one and at the same time.
And unique about the online private data storage is that only a user can reach what kind of explanation can reach.
The company refers to this as "personal distribution through data."
Inrupt's idea, according to company Managing Director John Bruce, is to the company to bring resources, process and accurate knowledge to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes the Berners-Lee Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the sanidians assigned to create this project and the volunteer community of the co-founders.
As of this week, technologyists around the world can create their one-part software using tools available on Inrupt.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team have not spoken to "Faceaebook and Google about whether or start a complete change where all their business examples will be joined in one night.
"We don't ask their permission."
"On the publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's message is to provide commercial energy and environment to help protect the righteousness and quality of the new network created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Union at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has contributed more to the debate of having an independent website.
Even during the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will remain Member and Director of the World Wide Web, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I have a wonderful hope about this web period," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Winner who won the Victoria Cross Award during WWWW1
The only British Church priest won the Victoria Cross Award during the First Great War as a fighter has been celebrated in his town 100 years later.
Colonel Lutena Shepherd Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the Bellenglise attack and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a target raider four days later and never found that he had won the highest military award of England.
The commemorationstone has been revealed by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that "is a strange example" that the stone is revealed primarily 100 years from his grandfather's victory.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Lutena Vann led his squad alongside Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a heavy fog and a sharp shooting from the field and gun."
He later ran on the shot line and with "the biggest adventure" led the line forward before using a field gun alone and aiming three weapons.
Colonel Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German target raider on 4 October 1918 - more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "the actions I know I can't reach but are very interesting."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a flower crown after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth's Bendi.
Michael Vann said "he was very respectful to participate in the parade" and added "the courage of a real hero is shown in support from many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig instead,
Consider this, you've waited all night to watch Bellator 206 but just rejected to watch the main event.
Bili from San Jose included 13 battles, including six on the main card and was flying straight all night in England through Channel 5.
At 12 a.m., while Gegard Moussa and Rary MacDonald were preparing to be mixed, viewers in England were left open mouths when the period was changed to Peppa Pig.
Others were disappointed after staying awake to early hours especially for fighting.
One poem on Twitter described changing and putting children's cartoons as "a kind of very bad joke."
"It's a government principle where it came at 12 a.m. content was not so good for you to change the program to be children," said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of markets and communications of Bellator, when asked about transmission."
"" Peppa the pig, "yes."
Bellator Scott Coker's president said they will go to work on their schedule to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the return, I think we can probably consider this," Coker said.
"But now it's 12 a.m. on Sunday there and we can't consider this until Sunday at our time, Monday at their time.
But we take it into account.
I believe, when it changed there was a lot of messages that were being sent and poorly intended.
We were trying to fix, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the matter of the government.
I can promise you that in the future something like that will not happen.
We'll put it in five battles instead of six - as we do normal - and we tried to work hard for fans but we failed.
It's an unexpected situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'weak' because of his gender
The diver at Olympia Tom Daley says he felt weak because of his gender the entire period of his growth—but that gave him a challenge to success in life.
This 24-year-old said he didn't realize it until he joined high school then "I realized that not everyone like me."
Speaking at Radio 4 at Desert Island Discs prepared by Lauren Laverne, says he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope."
He says that the parental action made him less focused on winning in Olympia games.
A long-term producer, Kirsty Young, has been out for a period of illness.
Participating as a person dedicated in the first period of Laverne, Daley says that he felt "a lack" than everyone of his age because "it was not accepted to love girls and boys."
He said: "Hadi today, the feelings of self-determination and limitations, and feel different from others are things that have given me the strength and ability to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he could not discourage anyone when they finally discover his gender.
The winner of the bronze medalist has been a prominent member of the LGBT support campaigns and was used as a furasa to participate in the Commwealth games in Australia to appeal to more countries not to consider the same-sex sex issue as a crime.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to be able to live without effect and wanted to give others "hope."
This three times in the world said to love another man - American filmmaker - Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "found him."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is an elder who is older than him for 20 years, last year but said that the age gap has never been a major issue.
"When you go through many things at a very young age" - he went to the first Olympic games at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find a man of the same age who had gone through such things.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his attitude" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I just thought 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things larger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold album is Robbie."
"The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not agree that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they had still found their Olympic tickets in London 2012 - because he wanted to be the front column.
"I couldn't tell him 'you can't go near the column hio father'," he said.
"I had caught his hand when he stopped breathing and had to stop breathing completely and died I believed he was defeated," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won copper.
"I just knew that this was what I had been lying for all my life - diving before the crowd of our people in the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also urged his choice of the first song - Proud sung by Heather Small - which had given him a challenge during Olympic preparation and made him a sympathic.

Mickelson who has been well-seasoned is placed on the bench in the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his game so that he will not reach the hio without fun.
Mickelson, playing in a double event a year and set a 12-time play record, was placed on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for a four-speed ball game and a pair game.
Instead of being in the depth of the event, how often he was for the United States, this five-time winner distributed his day between being fan and practicing the game in hopes of adjusting his problem.
It is never a leader even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player is not the right choice for the game in Le Golf National, which bad ball is repeatedly punished.
And if the field is not enough reason, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces British champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the new player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of this week.
If Americans, who are four points back as they start a 12-man match, they have a great resistance, Mickelson's match can prove to be absolutely important.
Furyk showed courage in his man, not that he could say more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, greeted me and embraced me and assured me that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He is very bold in his ability.
He is a popular man and has contributed much to these teams in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't see him playing two matches.
I expected to play more, but that's what happened and that's the way we thought we should consider.
He wants to be there out playing, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo record for many matches in the Ryder Cup played Sunday.
It may be its end in playing the Ryder Cup that has never been identical to his personal record.
Mickelson wins 18, losing 20 and seven uniforms, although Furyk said his presence brought some benefits to the team.
"He's funny, bold, likes to joke people and it's a good man to have him in the team," he explained.
"I think that the young players were also happy to fight him too this week, which was interesting to see.
He has more contribution than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the leadership of many points can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that if a great leadership enters the last days of the Ryder Cup can turn into a nervous journey.
The Danish played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros led with five points against Americans but finished while the game was heated, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding ourselves that we had a great leadership in Valderrama; we had a great leadership in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but very closely," said Bjorn, having been photographed, after watching the 2018 Class winning 5–3 Friday and yesterday and leading 10–6 in Le Golf National.
So history points to me and everyone on the team that the game has not yet ended.
You'll go to be more aggressive there tomorrow.
Go there and make sure you have done what you should.
This game has not ended until you get a score.
We have a goal and it's trying to win this shell and that's what we're targeting.
I've said this all the time, I'm considering 12 players who are in our team, but we know the quality of the team's best-class players in the world.
"If he is pleased with how his players did in a hard field, Bjorn added: "I would not have more hopes of this in this.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
Tomorrow is a personal activity that will decide and that is different.
It's good to be out there with an associate when things are interesting, but when you're out there alone, then you've been fully tested for all your ability as a golf player.
That's the message you need to tell players, it's doing your best tomorrow.
Now, you let your partner go and act better, too you.
"Unlike Bjorn, the team captain Jim Furyk will hope his players will act better personally compared to when they played as partners, except Jordan Jordan and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself was involved in the popular games on the last day, after becoming part of the winning team in Brookline before finishing with defeat when Europe found "The Medinan City."
"I remember every word," he said when he was given about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, brought his players together to the last day.
"We have 12 key matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get a good start as it was in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
While the speed goes in one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We successfully organized our players and put people in a way we felt we preferred, you know, we're trying to perform a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given a job of trying to lead the fight and deal with Rary McIlroy in a high-profile match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter others in the European team in the top half of the list.
"I went with this group in this order because I think it shines all the journey," said Bjorn for his choice of players in a private game.
The new German war ship is re-existed
The newest German Navy ship was scheduled to launch in 2014 to replace the old ships used in the Cold War, but it will not be until at least next year due to bad systems and increased costs, the media reported.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the leading ship between new Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine quoted a military spokesman.
This ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but the issues of later transmission affected the fate of this major project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 come to replace Bremen's warships.
It is known that they will include a strong division, a column of rugby and aircraft and missiles to decorate with ships as well as secret technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and akostic signals.
Other key components include organizations after a long time - it is possible to send the new ships for two years away from home.
However, the ongoing delay means that the high-profile warships - said to allow Germany to aim abroad - will already be outdated when it begins to be used, explained Die Zeit.
The F125 gained popularity last year, when German Navy refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss airport in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned ships to the ship's builders after the presentation.
Nothing is known about the reasons for restoration, but German media referred to several reasons for "the important programs and chips" that made ships less important if they were taken to war.
The shortage in the program was important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ship will be operated by 120 - a half of the crew on the former Bremen ships.
It also happened that the ship has an extra weight something ablo reduces its performance and limit the ability of the Navy to improve the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship of 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy compared to German-like ships in the Great War II.
Besides faulty chips, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - is also a major issue.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion yuro ($3.6 billion) - from the initial cost of 2.2 billion yuro.
The problems facing a new ship become especially important from warning that the ability of German cultivation has dropped.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the Waterwater actually "is going to miss ships capable of being sent to war."
The officer said that the issue has been being ignored for a long time, because the old ships were removed but no alternative ships were issued.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships that would be used by the Navy.
Nationa Trust sells the secret life of bats
New research conducted in the Scottish Mountains aims to describe how bats are using the environment in hunting their foods.
You expect these results will provide new details about the behavior of these unique animals to fly and help guide future conservation operations.
A study of scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will follow the pipistrelles and soprano and soprano bats and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross Gardens.
Special rekoda will be placed in key areas near the area to track bats operations all the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct a telephone investigation using hand-to-defenses.
Sound analysis for the professional of all records will confirm the frequency of bat sounds and the species that do so.
Environmental map and reports will be released to create a deep-speed environment for their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant in NTS, expects results to show what environmental areas are most important to bats and how they are used by every species of bats.
This explanation will help determine the benefits of environmental management work such as the creation of pasture and the best ways to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and England has declined considerably over the last century.
They face threats from the construction and development work that affects nests and housing loss.
Winds and lamps can also cause danger, as well as pesticides and some of the chemical products of building materials, as well as the cat attacks of pets.
Pop is not especially blind.
However, from their night hunting habits their ears are more important than their eyes arrive is a step to catch prey.
They use a complex method of echoing the area to aim for insects and obstacles in their way.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens of 76,000 acres (6,000 ha) of land across the country, is focused on bats very seriously.
It has provided training for ten trained experts, who occasionally do research, nest inspection and sometimes save bats.
The organization has even established the first and unique bat reserve in Scotland on the Treave property in Dumfries and Galloway, where it is home to eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson has said the property is the best area for the bats.
"Here in Threave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good environment.
But there is much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and in other assets will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
"He insists on the importance of watching the presence of bats before making organizations within the property because it is possible for unconscious damage you can kill to the female bats and 400 young bats, and probably destroy all the number of bats in the area.
Pops are protected and illegal to kill, harass or disrupt their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrrell, a Scottish officer at Popo Conservation Corporation, has urged the public to intervene and help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our bats because most of our species do not know how many of our species remain."
Ronaldo denies rape claims while lawyers plan to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has said rape claims against him are "false news," saying that people "want to declare themselves" using his name.
His lawyers have planned to settle the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese striker and Juventus have been charged with raping a American woman , her name Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have later paid him $35,000 to be silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on the live Instagram video for his 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, aged 33, reprimanded the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, "five times the Ballon d'Or award wins says on the camera."
"They want to declare myself with my name.
It's normal.
They want to be popular by naming my name, but it's part of the work.
I'm happy and I'm all right, "The player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the allegations, which they said is "unacceptable statements of suspicion in the private area," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek to be compensated for "moral damage in accordance with the weight of violations, which may be one of the biggest violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event is said to have been held in June 2009 in the chamba at the Palms Hotel and Kasino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported to return to the player's room, where he is allegedly raped him on the back, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt after the incident and told him that for "99%" he is a "good" man who was dropped by "one%."
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it was voluntary.
Mayorga also says he went to report to the police and was photographed by his injuries in the hospital, but later accepted an external compensation of the court because he felt "a fear of revenge" and was concerned about "the public humiliation."
The 34 - year - old woman says she is now ready to regret the ransom because she continues to suffer from the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the allegations, and this season moved to Italian champions Juve when he was purchased for £100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' for losing auto manufacturers
England 'will regret forever' for losing his position as a world leader in auto production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "unfair" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a contract could stop for the production time in his factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr Clark
Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays in borders if there is no contract after Brexit would lead to the loss of employment.
Burnaston - which makes Auris Toyota and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year where 90% were sold abroad in the European Union.
"My view is that if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union in March we will see the move to stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed fear of leaving the European Union without agreement about how the border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main issues are related to what manufacturers say are the dangers of distribution in the event that there is no agreement after Brexit.
Toyota production is implemented on the basis of "time-time", and equipment reaching every 37 minutes from sales in the UK and the European Union for ordered cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without agreement on March 29, there may be problems in the border where the sector says can cause delay and shortage of equipment.
It is impossible for Toyota to wait more one day in its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will be suspended.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's Checkers' plan for future relations with the European Union is "organized to avoid the investigation in the border."
"We need to have a plan. We want to have a better deal that will allow not only success at present but also take the opportunity, "He told Today's show of BBC Radio 4.
"The witness from not just Toyota but other manufacturers are that we really need to be able to continue to find distribution that has been successful before."
Toyota could not say the time of the suspension of production, but for a long time, it warned that additional costs will reduce the factory competition and eventually lose employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite Union in the factory, said his allies are increasingly concerned: "In my experience after these jobs leave they never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have set a proper and credible deal of our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump and Rosenenstein Conference may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with deputy chief lawyer Rod Rosenstein can "relay for another week" with a match about the high court selection Bret Kavanaugh continues, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenenstein manages the work of special consultant David Mueller, who investigates election intervention with Russia, the relationship between Trump and Russia's assistants and the possibility of a fair prevention by the president.
If or Trump's will seek the deputy work of the general lawyer and thus endanger Mueller's freedom, it has sparked Washington speculation for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to White House, while it was said to have been about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations conference in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said "a preference" not to cancel Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with the case in the Senate Court Committee that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, all witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, causing delays of the full Senate vote.
Trump's secretary Sarah Sanders, was in Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenenstein conference, he said: "Tarehe for that is not set, it may be this week, I can see that causing it to be pushed back for another week considering things in the high court.
But we will see what will be like and inform the media.
"Other writers could oppose the words: Sanders has not hosted a press conference in White House since September 10.
The owner Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of information is not due to not favouring television journalists "interesting attention," although he said: "I don't want to disagree with the fact that they attract attention."
He then said that direct contact between Trump and journalists will increase.
"The president performs questions and Answers than any previous president," he said, adding without mentioning evidence: "We've looked at the statistics."
"The release of information to journalists will continue, Sanders said, but "if the media has the opportunity to ask him direct questions of the United States president, that's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it many times and you've seen if we do it more in the past few weeks and that this will replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
"Trump responds regularly to questions when leaving White House or participates in open settings or meetings with foreign leaders.
Meetings and media alone are rare.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, by giving an unorganized speech and sometimes appearing in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Minister writes to European Union staff at the Health Organization on Brexit's fear
Health Minister has written to European Union workers working at the Health Association in Scotland giving thanks for the country and expecting they will remain after Brexit.
Jenane Freeman MSP sent a letter while remaining six months to the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union.
The Scottish government has volunteered to reach the cost of housing applications for European Union citizens working in its public services.
In his letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In summer, talks between the United Kingdom and the European Union about withdrawal have continued, towards decisions expected this season of leaks.
But the British Government also improves its provisions for the impossible solution.
I know this is a very unhappy time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to mention how I appreciate the contribution of each worker, regardless of their nationalism.
Wenzetu from all over the European Union and more, they bring valuable experience and knowledge that strengthen and improve the health care work, and help patients and the community we serve.
Scotland is your home completely and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Emergency Surgery After Head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was under emergency surgery after getting a head injury in a game who failed 31–27 on Saturday against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
Tennessee's chief coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the edge and only collapsed," Reed said.
The staff and medical doctors gave Abercrombie oxygen on the banks before putting him on the stretcher with further assessment.
Official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV period in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been completed at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no description of the type/season of pain still" and Tennessee State is trying to identify when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-class student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five confrontations on Saturday before leaving the game, which added a total of confrontations in the season to 18.
Foreign consumers will be paid a high stamp tribute buying in England
Consumers from foreign countries will be paid a high stamp tax buying property in the UK with additional funds used to help homeless people under the new Tory plan
The hio action aims to balance Corbyn's success of attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tribute will be paid to those who do not pay their tribute in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to get up to $120 million annually - to help homeless people.
Foreign consumers will be paid a high stamp tax buying property in the UK - and extra funds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May has announced today.
The move will appear as an attempt to balance the success Jeremy Corbyn has found to attract young voters with a promise to provide affordable homes and aim for those with high income.
The increase in the stamp tax will be charged with individuals and businesses that do not pay their tribute in the UK, with additional funds used to improve the government's plan to fight the residential situation for non-homes.
The extra payment - which includes the current stamp tribute, including high standards set two years ago in the second homes and rental homes - may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the move will give it to $120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new buildings are purchased by non-American residents, resulting in the increase in prices and make it difficult for the first buyers to buy their first home.
Many rich parts of the country - especially in the capital - have been "a ghost" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend their time abroad.
The new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson requested a cut in the stamp tribute to help younger people buy their first house.
He shocked large construction companies by setting high prices by purchasing farms and failing to build and ask Mrs. May to withdraw from taxing the house to repair the UK "the deputy in the home sector".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series that appeals to residential evolution, including tax control to end the expulsion "without error".
He also wants to give the councillors more authority to build a new house.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I wanted to volunteer to restore the dream of England - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means changing our damaged residential sector.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and establish a new life.
However, it cannot be fair that it is easy for people who do not live in England, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes at the same price as residents working hard in the UK.
For so many people the dream of ownership has been far away and there is a lot of possibility of being homeless."
Jack Ross: 'The fate of my resolution is to be a Scottish boss'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "season" is to be a Scottish manager in a period.'
This Scottish, 42-year-old, is very happy with the challenge of resurrecting the North-east club, now in third place in the First League, three points from above.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this season after helping St Mirren return to the Scotland League last season.
"I wanted to play my country as a player.
I was able to get a team game B and reached there, "Ross told BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and I was always impressed by that thing.
However, the opportunity will only come, if I will succeed in the club's administration."
" Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not afraid to follow the popular names in such a large club, after refusing Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this time will be measured for 'how, can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, it should certainly be in the British Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to return, but I'd just like to see myself if I've been successful here if I can return the club up there."
"Ross has only three years since he started management work, after a period as a manager's assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a tutor worker at Hearts club.
He then helped Alloa from being lowered to third and replaced St Mirren from being lowered to the bridge until winning the League cup the following season.
And Ross says he feels better than he was when playing Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"The other was a real way," he recalled, taking Alloa's administration.
"I certainly believed the management was good for me, more than playing.
It seems strange because I did the same, I got income from playing and enjoying the highest conditions.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I still go through this in the matter of stress and pressure of work but I feel management is right.
I always wanted to be a supervisor and now I do it, I feel better in me throughout my life to be an adult."

The best time for alcohol is 11.30 p.m. Saturday, research has discovered
Summer heat has increased drinking in British bars that are struggling but has increased pressure on restaurants.
Baa received an increase of 2.7% July - but drinking in restaurants dropped to 4.8 percent, data showed.
Peter Martin, of CGA's commercial consultant, which included the data, said: "The continuation of the sun and the most temporary participation of the UK in the World Cup means July followed the same example as last June, while bars got an increase of 2.8%, except that the restaurants had even more effect.
A 1.8% in the restaurant business in June was even more damaged in July.
The drinks did better with restaurants with a cut.
Food bars were affected in the summer, although not like restaurant operators.
It seems people just want to go out and get alcohol.
The controlled Baas gained an increase in sales of 6.6% per month and food reduced by three%."
"Paul Newman, entertainment and hospitality critic in RSM said: "These results continue in the direction we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social events or sports are still the biggest reasons that affect sales in the home market.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the decline of 4.8% sales per year will bite very much to consider the ongoing cost pressure.
Long-term summer has reached the worst time for food service providers and will have to wait if the average temperature we got in August will change things to be good."
"The overall growth of sales in bars and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7% in July, compared to the decline of brand products.
Marketing monitoring in the Coffer Peach Tracker sector for bars and restaurants collect and criticize the data of activity from 47 working groups, with a total of over $9 billion sales and is an important model in the sector.
One of five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One of five children - even 11 - they have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, research reveals
Research for 20,000 high school students has shown growth in the pages "false Insta" pages
The report has caused fear that sexual content is published
Twenty% of students said they own a "great" account to show parents
One of five children - even 11 - they create fake social media accounts that keep secrets from adults.
Research for 20,000 high school students has shown rapid growth in the account "Insta fake" - references to the website to share Instagram.
News has added fear that sexual content is published.
Twenty% of students said they create a "great" account to show parents, while also own other private owners.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's website found a young man urging others "I'm sorry."
The Digital Awareness UK and the British High Teachers Association of independent schools (HMC), found 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two and a half accounts agreed to keep an account privately.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It concerns that many young people are being tried in creating online areas that parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletes board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletes board as an inactive director at the year's general meeting of the federal board.
Doyle is a Scottish athlete with more awards and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the game to benefit from his extensive experience in the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish community, England and the world athletes community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by associating him on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm willing to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the game in Scotland."
The American, who won a 200-metre race and 400 m in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between the total of its four Olympic gold and is now a analyst at the BBC station, failed to walk after finding a lack of blood flow.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it would be known only in time if I can recover and to what extent.
It has been a hard job to recover fully, learn again how to walk and today to make a comeback!
Thanks to a message of comfort!"
A broadcast of a breast pump that compares mother to cows creates different online comments
The breast pump company has divided online comments using an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to the milked cows.
To indicate the launch of what is known as "the most silent breast pump in the world," a company of users Elvie's technology that released a comedy video broadcast to show the freedom that a new pump gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers play dens in a barn filled with cow food with a song that includes such words as: "Well, I get rid of myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you haven't realized this is my breasts."
The song continues: "Get out, decide out, I feed the children, decide out, decide out, I decide my women."
However, a announcement, published on Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
For 77,000 times to be watched by hundreds of comments, video has found different opinions from viewers and many say it shows the "fear" of the milk sector.
"A very bad decision using cattle to announce this product.
If we need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless their children are removed immediately after birth, "one wrote.
Elvie's breast album enters very well within the breast-feed (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: "It's disturbing mother and child's imagination.
But why not use them to announce a breast pump to mothers who remain with their children?"
Another person added: "A non-season announcement."
Others defended a announcement and a woman agreed that he felt the song as "laughs."
I think this is a very aggressive idea.
I would find one if I were still nursing.
To decide made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is stupid but I understand it.
This is a product of high-profile design, "one wrote.
Another person said: "This is a fun announcement that aims to have a mother that determines milk (often in the workplace or toilet) and feels like "a cow."
"This is not a declaration to praise or shock the milk sector."
At the end of the video a group of women shows that they have all played with a pump on their sindia.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use pump say they feel like cows.
Elvie's album however, is quite silent, it has no cables or typubu and is fully satisfied within the breast-feed and gives women freedom by moving, holding their children and even going out when they milk milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and teacher of ECD in Mother said: "The Elvie's tape is a revolutionary product that qualified for the bold and inspiring launch.
In view of the narrowness between describing women and dairy we wanted to put an act of breast-saving and all its challenges in oversight, while showing in a way that is fun and interesting the meaning of the feelings of freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has hit the headlines.
During the Style Week in London, a mother of two children walked on the stage with the architect Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrants Exile to Toent Camp in Texas border
The number of children detained immigrants has increased even though the number of passingers has not changed, because politics and strict policies issued by Trump's regime have made it difficult to keep children with philanthropists.
Typically, many philanthropists have become unregistered immigrants and have been afraid to risk their ability to pray in the country by continuing to demand a child.
The danger increased in June, when the country's authority announced that possible donors and other adults of the house would have to submit fingerprints and that the data will be shared by immigration authorities.
Last week, Mathew Albence, senior officer of Migration and Act of Forodha, witnessed before Parliament that the organization had captured several people who had asked to fund the children alone.
The organization later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous crime records.
"About 80% of people who are philanthropists or family members are here illegally and most of them are criminal visitors.
. So we continue to track the people, "Mr. Albence said.
In the process of cutting children more quickly, the leaders established new laws that would require some of them to be presented in court within a month after being arrested, instead of 60 days, which was a custom before, according to residential workers.
Many will be presented via a meeting phone via video, instead of being present, asking their case for legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who are considered worthy of help will be returned to their land quickly.
How a child remains in detention for a long time is the possibility of fear and anxiety or discouragement, which can cause feelings of violence or attempts to escape, according to the staff of the residence and reports that have emerged from the system several months ago.
The lawyers said these issues are increasing in large stations such as Tornillo, where the sign that the child has a bad condition is ignored, due to its size.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving enough time to provide them emotionally or interact with friends at the last time can increase the existence that many are already going through.
Syria tells the American 'American soldiers, France and Turkey immediately leave
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Kad al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although now eight years of war in the country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are in Syria illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be handled accordingly."
"They should leave immediately and without any terms," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that "war against terrorism was about to be completed" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been thrown into their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy war until we save all Syria" from all terrorist groups and "any foreign presence."
"University has about 2,000 Syrian forces, especially for training and counseling Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in a war - torn country.
In the refugee issue, Moualem said the situation was good for them to return and blamed "the western countries" for "to spread false fear" which has caused refugees to stay away.
"We have requested an international community and human organizations to enable return steps," he said.
"They put politics in the human issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to build for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a isolated bafa area in the last Idlib rebel stronghold has created the opportunity to move forward with political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkey agreement has blocked the attacks of Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem however insisted that the agreement had "open time" and expressed hope that military action will help militants including militants from Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be completed."
United Nations Commissioner Staff de Mistura hopes to host the first meetings of a new committee that includes government members and opposition to provide a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the election route.
Moualem set the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be controlled "to investigate current constitution passages," and warning against intervention.
The Reasons Trump Will Win the Choice for the Second Age
with the logic, Mr. Trump will again win the 2020 election unless the viewers like progress and many changes hope that the removal of the wrong use of power and scandals will end his presidency early.
And that of course "the greatest end of the presidency forever!"
Currently, there are no signs of the fatigue of the viewer.
Since 2014, the estimate of the main times has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and about three to 1.6 million times on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, an increase from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Madow Show" leads to a cable television assessment for 3.5 million viewers in the main night of the news.
"These are things that draw people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the play show ABC "Designated Survival," about minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed Capitol's main offices.
Nell Scovell, a former comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalls a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said," because he makes me laugh, "" Mrs. Sovell told me.
There is a value of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, a story from Washington may later decide Roe v. against Wade, if immigrant families can again merge with the health of the world's economy.
The appearance is just a luxury for viewers with many opportunities they can afford.
However, this issue exceeds a conscious citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour of watching the panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "high" in the sources of his book "Hofu," the £15,000 of Paul Manafort's skin ("a heavy proud dress, "Washington Post said) and the result of Stormy Daniels' description of Mr. Trump's body.
I, never, I'll never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"The part of what he does and makes it look like a real show is that he gives you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, the main executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the "Pown Stars," about Trump's show to change characters and scenes daily (to start confrontation in NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't want to miss one time or stop pursuing.
When I approached Mr. Fleiiss this week, there was a 80-century sun outside his house to the north of Kauai, but had locked up inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not leave there, not like Bret Kavanaugh approaching to front of the Senate Court Committee and the Supreme Court's fate if it is unknown.
"I remember when we were doing all these amazing periods in the past and the people were saying," this is the last beginning of Western civilization, "" Mr. Fleis told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns right."

Outer funds overflow within the closest election of Parliamentary representatives
It is no wonder that 17 Pennsylvania districts have received a financial flood, due to re-innovating the parliamentary districts that found two current leaders fighting for the same seat.
The district that gained new borders of Pittsburg has a Representative of the Democratic Conor Lamb - who won his seat in other districts in the final spring election.
Lamb runs for another person's role, the Crepublican Keith Rothfus, the current leader representing the former district of Pennsylvania 12th, which is widespread by 17 new.
The maps were again painted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts had been painted to fit the Crepublicans.
The rugby in 17 new has established financial competitions in the federal funding groups, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Council of the Crepublican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb was a popular name in Pennsylvania after a small victory in a special election followed in March in the 18th Pennsylvania Parliamentary District.
The seat had been held by the Crepublican for more than one decade by President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts say the Wademokrats have a little better win.
The United States imagined Punishment El Salvado for Supporting China, Then Let It Leave
The diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and a small pressure to do so from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the allies launched the Trump Corporation management team.
Officials in the State Department decided to remove the U.S. diplomatic message from El Salvado, the Dominican Republic and Panama regarding "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," the department spokesman Heather Nauert, said in an early report this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvado, which earned $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included the reduction of financial aid and restrictions of visa applications, would have a significant impact on the Central American country and unemployment and high murder rates.
While domestic meetings continue, North and Central American leaders proposed a high-profile meeting in connection with security and economic well-being and following such a meeting of last year that seemed to be a forward step in an effort to prevent immigrants to the United States.
But in mid-final, the top leaders of the regime declared that they wanted the meeting to continue ahead and effectively end any penalty focus on El Salvado.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the meeting, scheduled to take place in mid- October, with a sign of importance that the regime has placed at the convention, diplomats said.
And three U.S. diplomats returned anonymously in El Salvado, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a strong new message or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton refused to report on the discussion of the debate made by three American leaders, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal dialogue without revealing identity.
Their views were confirmed by an external critic near the regime and also spoke without revealing identity.
A History Survey
The next fate may be a report by special lawyer Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump's possibility to prevent justice, where there is now a great witness in the public.
Mr. Mueller also directs his investigation as Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in attacking our election.
If Congress changes control, Mr. Trump will find himself facing responsible cases in the parliament, just as he prepares to go again to vote for voters and perhaps eventually the judges of his allies.
These are many things that only say is possible and I don't say that Mr. Trump's removal in power is inevitable - nor for leaders like him in Europe.
There are options that must be made by every Atlantic side that will affect how the struggle is going on for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were willing to make a coup against Hitler, only if Western nations refused to support and support Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years of murder.
The direction of history surrounds such changes and the stability of the course of democracy is being rushed or delayed.
Americans face several changes at present.
How will we do if Mr. Trump cancels Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation fate?
Rosenenstein has been in a bad situation since the newspaper reported that last year, he proposed recording the president secretly and said that he is not worth being afisini.
Mr. Rosenstein says Times' memory is incorrect.
"How can we answer if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete and fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, we'll vote in the election of Parliamentary representatives who will not be able to make Mr. Trump consider righteousness?
If we fail these measurements, democracy will face the risk of prolonged decline.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovakia who was transferred to Auschwitz by the Nazi government that was once using my diplomatic house.
He survived, moved to the United States and, 60 years later, he sent me to light Sabbath candles on a table with a swing signal.
With that like my inheritance, how can I miss a positive attitude regarding our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers has many hopes before the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers are a host of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after a good uniform in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, it will put them in a good position to score from the G Group in Europa League.
The knee injury prevented the link Graham Dorrans not playing his first match this season to the 2–2 uniform against Villarreal but believes Rangers can use the results to start many things.
"It was a good mark for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the game if we believed we could find something and we returned with one score.
Maybe we could get more at the end but, in general, uniform probably was the same result.
They were probably better in the first half and went in the second half better.
Enter Thursday, it's another big night in Europe.
We hope, we can get all three points but you'll be a hard game because they got a good result in their last game but, as well as our fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and get good results.
Last year it was very difficult, between everything that happened to my casualties and changes in the club but there is a good feeling about this place now.
The squad is the same as players are very happy; your training is the same.
We expect, we can push now, forget the previous season and succeed."
Women lack sleep from fear of savings for retirement
Although true that research members had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, a few people were talking to their families about this.
About half of the people in the nationwide research said they were talking to their lovers about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want family partners to care for them, but do not take steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide insurance business.
This is how one starts.
Talking to your boyfriend and children: You can't provide your family to provide services if you don't make your wishes well known before time.
Share it with your mentor and your family to discuss where and how to receive services, because these options can be important in determining costs.
Share your financial mentor: Your mentor can also help you find a way to pay the bills.
Your funding options for long-term care can include long-term insurance policy, a policy of a coalition of financial value to address these expenses or independence for your wealth - the best has money.
Use your legal documents: Share your legal cases early.
Get a representative document of the medical service so that you can appoint a trusted person to manage your medical care and ensure that experts are obeying your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also, consider the lawyer's contribution to your money.
You should choose someone you believe to make financial decisions for you and guarantee your expenses are being paid on time.
Don't forget small details: Think that your elderly parent has an emergency for treatment and is on the way to go to the hospital.
You have the ability to answer questions about medicine and hemispheres?
Keep the comments in a written arrangement to be ready.
"Not only money is involved, but who are doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the treatment?
Who will deal with a dog?
Keep the plan appropriate."

State prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspect of terrorist attacks in New York City
New York prosecutors seek death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspect of terrorist attacks in New York City which killed eight people - a rare penalty that has not been carried out in the state for state crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is allegedly using Home Depot's rental car to make an attack on a bicycle route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists in his way in October.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "for purpose" killed eight victims and "for purpose" caused serious physical injuries, according to a report of the intention of seeking death penalty, issued in the Southern New York District.
All these errors carry the possibility of death sentence, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a panel of judges issued 22 charges to Saipov which included eight charges of murder with fraudulent aid, usually used by state prosecutors in organized crime charges and charges of violence and traffic damage.
Attacks needed "to organize and well prepared," prosecutors said, describing the action Saipov that he acted as "a offensive, cruel and misleading."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, destruction, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," a report of the will said.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the South New York District carried out charges of death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to a life passage in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in the New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a husband and wife punished for death after being convicted of plotting to make a fan for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The two Rosenberg were killed by death by being placed in the power seat on 19 June, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret day and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was moved to carry out the attacks after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to charges.
He also asked to show ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has denied 22 criminal charges.
David Patton, one of the country's public advocates representing Saipov, said that they have been "broken" by the prosecution decision.
"We think the decision to seek death penalty rather than accept guilty requests for the imprisonment of life in prison without the possibility of being released will only add to such events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's representative team previously asked prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage swore to 'inciting the army' today during the protest at Tory conference.
Former Kup leader said politicians should 'feel warm' from citizens who oppose the European Union - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be the president of talks with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK should be out' now as Mr. Farage would be Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces is the challenge of bringing together his very divided side of the matter that was evident when Tory supporters of Remain joined different protests against Brexit in town.
The prime minister is working to implement his Checkers agreement program while facing criticism from supporters Brexit, supporters of the European Union.
His members insisted that he will continue ahead and the move to try to reach a consensus with Brussels despite the objections-and forcing anti-European Union and Leba to choose between his plan and 'obscenes'.
Mr Bone told Leave Means Leave's meeting in Solihull that he wanted to 'throw off Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr. Farage was to be made a partner and was given responsibility for talks with Brussels.
‘If he had control, we would be ready out now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I'll support Brexit but we need to forget Checkers' plan.'
Showing his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We didn't fight in the world war to pray under others.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone denied proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their ideas and want to remain completely false.'
'The Tory MP supporting Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in protest and told reporters: 'I just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
'The Checkers' plan is not very well-known by the public in general, Opposition cannot vote for it, it is not given by our party and our activists who really go to the streets and help us be selected.
Please leave the Checkers plan and start listening to people.'
In a message directed to Mrs. May, he added: 'The Chiefs preserve their positions when they keep their promises.'
Mr.Fage told the meeting that politicians should be made 'feel warm' if they are about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'This is about the issue of loyalty between us - people - and our political class,' he said.
'They try to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we can't let him do it.'
In a message to the excited crowd added: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, feel warm.
'We're encouraging the army of this country that will give us victory in Brexit and which will never rest until we are free, rely on ourselves, be a proud England.'
Meanwhile, Supporters remained in protest through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Many activists showed banners written Tories against Brexit after the group's launch at the end of this week.
Leba MP Mr. Adonis mocked Conservatives for the security problems they received in the party program when the meeting was opened.
'These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technologies of the UK and the European Union to respect the laws of another, for a free trade without borders in Aylandi,' added.
'It's a empty lie.
Nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans 'looking in detail' the intention of running for presidency,
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he plans to "look in detail the intention of running for presidency" after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Wademokrats discussed his fate during the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is about to win the World Cup after team orders give him victory against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear since Valtteri Bottas won before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the team's orders Mercedes would contribute a major role in the race.
From the beginning, Bottas got a good start and almost completely left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two circuits and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel took the lead first and left Hamilton to follow the friendship on the group's tail, something that had to contribute much.
Mercedes made one circuit behind Vettel, but Hamilton passed forward after a strong contest that made Ferrari's driver leave the inner area free from the effect of being closed after doing so twice in the third corner.
Max Verstappen began in the back line and was in the seventh place for the end of the first round on his birthday to reach the age of 21.
He then led for a large part of the race and held and then passed Kimi Raikkonen and became fourth.
He eventually reached his renovation area in the 14th round and failed to accelerate in the remaining eight circuits while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a strange work of whole wikendi and showed maturity to allow me to pass.
Team has done a special job to take first and second place," said Hamilton.
That was a very Bad Language of the body
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday conference on his insistence that he did not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the selection of the Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh.
Speaking at the West Virginia conference, the president did not directly discuss the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Court Committee, instead said that what is going on in the Senate showed that people "were selfish, bad and false."
"One thing that can happen and good that has been going on a few days ago in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry and selfish and malicious and false," he said.
"When you look at offerings and revelations and then say" oh, I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal?
You remember his answer ... did you reveal a document - "oh, oh, what?
Ah no!
I didn't reveal.
"Well, wait a minute.
Did we reveal ...No, we didn't reveal, "he added, in imitation of the senator.
Feinstein was used a letter describing charges against Kavanaugh and Ford in July and was exposed early in September - but Feinstein denied that it came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr Ford's charges. I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it in secret as he asked."
But his revelations were not seen to be well received by the president, who commented during the Saturday night meeting: "I'll tell you, that was a terrible body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that's the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the appointment of the Supreme Court, who has been charged with sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their benefit.
"They have decided to take power in any way.
You see selfishness, evil, they don't care who they hurt, who have affected them to gain authority and control, "Mediaite reported the President saying.

Air Friendship Control Dies while ensuring Hundreds of Travelers on Birds Can Avoid Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic control has been credited with being a hero after losing his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people has left safely.
More than 800 people have died and others lost after a major earthquake occurred on the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused tsunami.
Later vibrations continue to occur in the area and many have been trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues to escape to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to escape from his position in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the road at the time, was able to fly safely.
He then flew the traffic control tower when he thought it was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yoannes Sirait, said that the decision was able to save hundreds of people, the Australian ABC News reported.
We hosted helicopters from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately we lost this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, leadership fears that the death toll can reach thousands and the country's disaster reduction organization has said that the reach of Donggala cities, Sig and Boutong are very small.
"The number is believed to be increasing as many bodies were still stuck under the falls while as a challenge to many," the organization's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nug Spirit said.
Six - foot - long waves have destroyed Palau that will provide a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing help and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is not readily available.
Small markets have been broken everywhere."
Jan Golfand, chief of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working to help the victims but we don't know how things are.
This is already a disaster, but the situation may be even worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every operation related to exile.
You're already?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was taken earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok where over 550 people died.
Birds fall in Mikronesian: Air Niugini now says that one person has been lost after a plane crash within the deserts.
The airline that has fallen in the Pacific Ocean in Mikronesian has now said that one person is not available, after which he had previously said that all 47 passengers and employees had been safely rescued when the plane sank.
Air Niugini said in a report that by Saturday afternoon, it was unable to know when he was a man.
The organization said it is collaborating with local leadership, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The organization did not immediately respond to more details regarding passengers, such as its age or nationalism.
Local boats helped save passengers and other employees after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Leaders said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The organization said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and were all in strong circumstances.
The cause of fate and the series of events is still unknown.
The organization and the American Navy all said the aircraft landed on the desert just before arriving on the route.
Some witnesses thought the plane had hit the road.
American passengers Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to walk through the water that reached the waist through the sinking emergency doors of the plane.
He said the crew were afraid and shouted and that he suffered a minor injury on the head.
U.S. Navy said sailors working to improve the piers were also able to save them using a breathboat to land before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 m)
Data from the Air Safety Network shows 111 people have died in the crash of aircraft registered by PNG in the past two decades but nothing was involved with Air Niugini.
A critic shows a record of events on the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution unit finished describing his case on Saturday in a return case where a man charged with burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a trained witness in the field of mental analysis.
He showed a panel of judges how he used mobile phone records to connect together the activities of a 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, a night of disaster.
Rowlett said he received local data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis had Chambers on the evening of his death, contrary to his previous claims, Clarion Ledger reported.
While data showed his mobile phone had Chambers' when he said he had his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on Saturday and witnessed that he was not in town that day.
While prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said they were in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my car was Nashville."
"Some words are that Tellis said he had known Chambers for just two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records show that they had known each other for just a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted a short phone message and a communication description of Chambers from his phone.
"He completely deleted him in his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin his closing points on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be sent to a panel of judges later that day.

Another black man?!
Home minister New York sues the couple for dismissal after a "discrimination" message
A home minister from New York sues the couple by dismissing him on the grounds of discrimination after receiving a non-her message from a mother who was complaining that he was "only another black man."
The couple refuse to be racial racists and represent the allegations with "swindling."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern after discovering that a new child service provider, Giselle Maurice, was a black man after his first day of work in 2016.
"HAPANAAAA MAN MINGINE MWE," wrote Mrs. Plasco -Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, he sent Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After discovering his errors, Plasco -Flaxman with "unfair" fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that their departure minister, of the African-American origin, had done a bad job and that instead expected Filipino, according to New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day of work and then returned to Uber's home.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation regarding dismissal and wants a $350 compensation a day for the sixth month, for the work of living and working, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, see, you don't die to do such actions," he told Post on Friday, adding "I know it's prejudice."
The couple have denied the claim that they are racists, saying that stopping Maurice work was the one that grew up the right step, fearing that they can't believe him again after he made a mistake.
"My wife had sent him a message he didn't intend'.
He is not a racist.
We're not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told Post.
"But can you put your children in the hands of someone you have offended him, even if it's wrong?
Your baby?
Say the truth."
Comparing the charges to "screaming," Plasco said it was just two months after his wife had a child and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Will you go to call for such a man?
That's not good to do," the bank investor said.
Although the legal case is still underway, the public opinion court has threatened the couple in social media, and attacked their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would not prefer the subject of a talk bear, a new letter shows
Bend's daughter Karen Jankel, born in bone after this book was accepted, said in connection with the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of a man who reads for the first time before publication.
It is very exciting to know about Paddington's great success."
Saying his father, who worked as a camera minister in the BBC before finding an inspiration to write a children's book from a little beary, would not have a bad feeling for his work rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "happy and sad" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who describes it as "the most important association of our family," added that his father was very happy with his success.
"He was a man without many words and was not arrogant," he said.
"But because Paddington was very important to him, it's like having a successful child: you're proud even though it's not your actions.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in a similar way.
Although it was his architecture and ideas, he was always praising Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to keep him on the phone.
After discovering that his daughter had been rushed to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad was calling regularly and saying that the situation was very bad and was not expected to live," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad to tell me he would die within the following two minutes and I had to give him goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi , I love you very much, my child.
I'll have you soon.
I'll have you.
The drugs that doctors had given him so that his spirit would continue to strike were slowly overrun in his system.
He had died shortly before and this action was just his system to stop working.
I just had to stay there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not cry or scream because I was in a situation that I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to give me heart.
"Last Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently mourning losing his daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers - without their knowing what he was going through.
"No one knew, he said.
"I had bowed my head and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's when I was in the plane I felt very sorry for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved him."
Women mourn the card to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones by suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on the Welsh bridge with a message that strengthens and phone numbers that people can call.
His son Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to be disturbed by stress and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel how I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his child was a highly optimistic chef and an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him with his smile.
Everyone said his smile was pleasing to all people."
However, he left work before he died, because he was" a dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the first to find his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "Daima I'm worried that this will affect others."
Mrs Davis created a card, "to enable people to know that there are people out there who can go and talk to them, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for many years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old lover, not long after his mother's death.
He didn't say that she feels bad or disturbed by thoughts," he said.
"Several days before Christmas we discovered changes in his attitude.
He was completely down on Christmas Day - when the children were opening their gifts he didn't want to look at them with eyes or communicate."
He said his death led them to get it, but they must try to continue life: "It puts a hole in the family.
It is depressing us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's sway as the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought, if we could find something like what he asked - a time-long investigation, the climax of size - maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "fall" due to the controversy of the following.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters of the Crepublicans did not want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is from time.
The representatives' election is held only five weeks from now, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Crepublicans are very weak, then they will be very weak in their efforts to put a person they want to be elected to the high court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling Maseneta, convincing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in White House under Mr.Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was secretary of Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI has released its report?
There will be voting in the Senate, where 51 Crepublicans and 49 Wademokrats are working.
It is still unclear if Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate, which will enable Mike Pence, vice president, to break uniforms and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugees 'down' under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un when he gained power seven years ago, South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean coalition ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the highest control in the border between North Korea and China and high fines charged with the sale of people were the main reason.
Pyongyang has not commented on the public.
Most of the North refugees are eventually given South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Korean people have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the area with many soldiers (almararka DMZ) in the middle of the two Korean countries.
China considers refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often restore them by force.
Relations between North and South - who are literally still in war - have changed significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met Pyongyang for a discussion that focused on the withdrawal of the standing nuclear weapons.
This event came after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapoo, when they agreed on broad terms to work to remove nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without any belief in the United States, there will be no confidence and our national security and under that situation, there is no way we will remove nuclear weapons as the first," said Mr Ri in the speech of the United Nations General Conference in New York.
Nancy Pelosi refers to Bret Kavanaugh as "unself-control," and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
A Few House leader Nancy Pelosi has said the selection of the Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh is a "uncontrolless" person and said he has such feelings not fit to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought that if it were a woman he had done that way, they would say 'not self-control,'" Pelosi said about her answers to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he persecuted Dak Christine Blasey Ford while they were young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and breath talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also made clear the Wademokrat on the committee, citing charges against him as "a offensive and scheduled to destroy his qualities" organized by angry sympathys that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he was incapable of serving in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he discriminates against the Democrats.
"I think he withdraws for the words and how he shocked Clinton's family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi did not refuse when asked if he tried to remove Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Wademokrats were many in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't say the truth to Parliament or to the FBI, then it is not only worth being in the Supreme Court, but also in the court when he is right now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Court of Appeals. Circuit.
Pelosi added that if the Wademokrat was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Bei Nafuu Service Act or Roe's case against Wade, because he is said to be a conservative judge.
In his testimony charges, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he could change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Not during an angry man, discrimination to go to the court and expect us to say, 'not that's weird,' said Pelosi.
And Women Should Use It.
It is a good review of the bitter, months and years of more rage and cannot remove it without crying.
"We cry when we're upset," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that it's normal, do you?"
He continued," I was very helped by a woman who was active somewhere, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but he developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started crying, she could tell someone who talks to him," you might think I'm sad because I cried.
I'm angry."
Then he continued to explain to me.
And I thought it was a good idea."
"The eyes are allowed as a way to remove rage because they are essentially unclear.
One of my memories I remember very much from my early career, is a male office, where I immediately found myself crying with unreasonable rage, I was caught in the back of the neck and the big woman - the administrator who was always afraid of me - who pulled me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see that you're crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy because you're with you."
Patricia Schroeder, then as a member of the Democratic party from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in a relationship outside of marriage in a boat known as Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Mrs. Schroeder, was very frustrated and saw there is no reason to think of the presidency.
"It's not a decision that made well," he told me while laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
There was someone referring to this as a popular film "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign time grew very much, he was back in raising the fedh and thus vowed that he would not enter the race unless he donated $2 million.
It was a war he was losing.
He found that some of his followers who donated $1,000 for men would give him only £250.
"Do they think that you don't get a price cut?" he wondered.
When he gave his speech to announce that he could not launch a formal campaign, he was filled with feelings of gratitude to people who helped him, confused with a system that made it very difficult to donate money and target voters rather than delegates and anger from gender discrimination - until he was inspired.
"You wouldn't think I had a nervous problem," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the media took the incident.
"You wouldn't think Kleenex was my business sponsors.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my grave?
"He cried"?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can benefit Beijing
The first voices in the trade war between the United States and China were very disturbing and although the war will not soon end, the difference between countries may be useful for Beijing for a long time, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by charging important Chinese sales including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most effective difference began this week with a new tribute affecting $200 billion worth products (150 billion), thus charging half of all products entering the United States from China.
Beijing has always retaliated, has recently placed a five to ten percent tribute for $60 billion of US products.
China has promised to meet US measures, and the second country in the economic size does not seem to be disappointed at any time soon.
Making Washington changes the action means you should accept terms, but publicly accepting the pressure of the United States will be a great embarrassment to Xi Jinping, president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game well, business war problems against the United States can help China for a long time by reducing the support between the two countries.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that can begin changes in economics in any country between it and more dangerous than others previously thought," said Abigail Grace, a research partner who considers Asia at the new Center for Security Advice in the United States.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria has said that it is ready for a voluntary return to refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country destroyed by a long-term war of over seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Kad al- Moualem said the situation in the country is being established.
"Today the real situation is more stable and safe due to the progress made in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists to restore them regularly.
All conditions are now to return voluntarily to refugees in the country where they had to escape due to terrorism and economic measures that affected their daily lives and their jobs.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al- Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the damaged country.
But he insisted that they do not want assistance on terms or assistance from countries that funded the terrorism.
Europe wins Ryder Paris Cup
The European team has won the Ryder 2018 Cup after winning the American team with the final 166.5 against 10.5 on Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when Denmaki team captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had a difficult time throughout the tournament, struck his first ball in the 16th hole of 3, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian player Molinari played well in all his turns and became 1 out of 4 to 5–0-0 since the current competition structure began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 by the player listed below in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmaki.
The player listed first place in the world, Dustin Johnson, fails 2 and 1 by the British Ian Poulter who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
The player in Ryder's Vines, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player in the tournament with 255 points in his games.
"It's not my usual to cry but today I'm sold.
It has been a challenging year.
Thanks to Thomas for selecting me and believing me.
I'm so happy, I'm glad to win the cup again.
The key is the team and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia who was filled with emotion after the European victory.
He transfers roles to fellow citizens John Ram who defeated the American Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a single man's game on Sunday.
"I feel wonderful pride, defeating Tiger Woods, I was looking at him as little," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13–21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising figure from one of the highest-class players ever existed, after winning 14 titles and being the second only to do so after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team was overwhelmed all the wikendi to put the ball part of the grass except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the highest game in all races.
American captain Jim Furyk spoke after the lower game of his squad, "I am proud of these players, fought.
There were times this morning where we made many challenges to the European team.
We fought.
Much respect for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll be organized again, I will work with our American PGA league and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will continue ahead.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to be captain.
You must give commendation.
They controlled us."
