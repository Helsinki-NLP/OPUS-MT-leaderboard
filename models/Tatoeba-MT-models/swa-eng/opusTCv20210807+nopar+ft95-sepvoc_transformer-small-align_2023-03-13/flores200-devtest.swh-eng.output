Martelly charged the new temporary Election Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month the presidential commission proposed the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of steps to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's answer to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, which are sometimes violent were introduced by a lack of elections, where another was late since 2011.

It is likely that comets were a source of water transport to the earth, as well as carbon products that can create proteins and help life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planet is created, especially how Earth was created, as comets collided with Earth for a while.
Cuomo, 53, started his courtyard earlier this year and signed a bill last month to justify same-sex marriage.
He cited the rumor as "political and folly".
He considered running for presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Air Federation's Administration claims would allow aircraft to use short routes and save millions of oil gallons each year and cut carbon production.
It uses a technology based on the satellite against a long-term technology based on ground radar to enable space traffic control to obtain space equipment more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is installed by high-level trains will not stand in Wembley, and parking lots and parking stations are not available there.
Fear of lack of transportation created the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
Research published on Thursday in Science reported the creation of new bird species in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was believed to take longer, due to the birth of Darwin's natives, Geospiza fortes , and immigrants of the brother's dungusi, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into different shapes, which can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled out to be a thin wire, which can be spun and pressed. It can be scrapped or rolled into a plate.
It can be made narrower, and rolled into other metals. It can be made narrower until sometimes used to decorate hand-made paintings called "a bill that was illuminated".
This is called pH of chemicals. You can create a signal to use red cabbage.
The cabbage art changes color according to chemical rebellion or berries.
The pH rate is determined by the amount of Hidrojeni ion (H in pH) on a chemical tested.
Hidrojeni is a protons that were attached to their electrons (in the form of Hidrojeni atoms have one proton and one electrons).
Shut up two dry powders and then, with clean, moist hands, put them into the ball.
Moisture on your hands will be touched by outer layers, which you will feel different from creating a certain type of bark.
Harappa and Mohejo-daro towns had a modern toilet in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
The remains of the sewage system have been found in the homes of the Kiminoa towns of Crete and Santorin in Greece.
There was also a toilet in Egypt, Persia and ancient China. In Roman civilization, the toilet was sometimes part of the public bathrooms where husbands and wives mixed together.
When you call someone away thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The space satellite gets a phone call and then rethinks it down, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent to space using rockets, which scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere disrupts part of our light and attitude.
You don't need a large rocket with over 100 feet long to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in a remarkable way. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a simple and quick transport.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other transport equipment.
Under it there are more average - body cats that feed on medium - body prey from rabbits to swing and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free pets) that feed on tiny prey, such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special task that each cat holds and prevents him from competing with others.
Lions are some of the most socialist cat animals, and live in large groups called prides.
The lion groups are made by husbands between one and three related adults, as well as many females like thirty and mashibli.
Women are usually the most closely related to each other, as a large family of auctions and daughters.
The lion groups act like wild dogs or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) behaviour, and are also dangerous to their prey.
A professional awai, tiger can climb (although not good), swimming, jumping too far and pulling five times of the strong man.
Leopard is located in one group (a genus panther) and lion, a target and a southern and central American leopard. These only four cats can roar.
The tiger’s Thunder is not like a lion’s giant Thunder, but more like a sentence of a rebuke with words given loudly.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats and birds as they can — almost all the animals that wild cats hunt are small than him.
Scientists think that wild cats follow and search for food animals, smell to find where they are on the ground.
They can see very well in darkness and night vision also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by mixing themselves with their surroundings kasha to jump their prey.
While a small group of living things (a small number) is separated from the large number they came from (if they pass over mountains or river, or move to a foreign island so much that they cannot easily go back) they will often find themselves in a different environment from where they were before.
This new environment has a different resource from different competitors, so a new number of people will need different components or practices to become stronger competitors than they needed before.
The number of nature has never changed, they still need the same original techniques.
For a while, how new numbers begin to adjust to their new environment, they are becoming more and more visible than the other number.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two inhabitants will appear very different that they cannot be called one species.
We call this process speciation, which ends the creation of new species. Speculation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and incorporate carbon dioxide that humans release outside (i.e. breathing outside).
Plants obtain their solar food through the light, and they also give it umbrellas
We make our homes with plants and make our clothes for plants, and much of the food we eat is plants, without plants, animals cannot survive.
Monowurus was a great hunter of the time, so it was not afraid of anything except other Monowurus.
His large jaws had over 70 sharp teeth like a razor, as well as an extra set on his mouth roof, meaning that anything that met him would not escape.
We do not know, but it may have had a divided tongue. His diet includes turtles, big fish, other mosou, and perhaps he can be a fellow creature.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even such a great dinosaau as T. rex would not be able to run against him.
While most of their foods we know, the Romans had their share of the strange or unusual parties, as well as wild pigs, peas, snails, and a type of mouse called domouse
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, wealthy people liked to have a party together where they would rest on the side while eating their food.
Ancient Roman meals would not include foods that entered Uropa from the United States or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no former Romane ever tasted ducks.
The Belgians built for each of their gods the basic temple that was considered the house of that god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to care for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each castle had an open castle square and then a sanctuary in which only the clergy could enter.
Sometimes special tower - shaped pyramids, called ggurat, were built to become part of the temple.
The upper part was the sacred dwelling of the god.
In the climate of the Middle East, the house was not very important.
Much of the life of the Hebrew family took place outside.
Women made recipes on the yard; the stoos were only open kaunts leading to the road, and the stones served to build a road.

Although every country was 'Kiskandavia', there were many differences between people, kings, customs and history of Denmaki, Sweden, Norway and Aislandi.
If you have watched the National Fund film, you may think a treasure map was written behind the Freedom Announcement.
However, that is not true, although there is something written behind the manuscript, it is not a treasure map.
Behind the Freedom Announcement was written "The Real Freedom of 4 July 1776". The text is in the lower section of the document, above.
When no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that the large leather manuscript (with 293⁄4 inches per 241⁄2) was folded for conservation.
So there is a possibility that the quote was added to be as a sign.
The next day of the attack and fighting had set free in northern France, but south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with attackers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, Friendly Forces attacked southern France, an attack was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the U.S. and Free France troops had freed France south and were heading for Germany.
Civilization is a culture of unity shared by a large group of people living and working in collaboration, society.
The term civilization comes from Latin civilis, which means civil, related to Latin civis, meaning citizens, and civitas, meaning town or town state, and which in some way describes the size of society.
The urban states put nations first. The civil culture marks the transmission of knowledge in several generations, its cultural ones that continue to stay temporarily and fair distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and not being recognized as a road civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with the United States Parliament being the only part of it – under Federal Articles.
The conference lacked any ability to keep tributes, and, because there was no national or court executive, based on national authority, who often had no cooperation, to enforce its laws.
It also had no authority to ignore laws and tribute lists between states.
Articles required a joint consent from all states before being amended by the states took the central government in such a joke that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian football team, along with the German football team is the world's second most successful team and was the 2006 FIFA World cup champion.
Popular games include football, basketball, netball, water powder, string game, raga, bicycle ride, ice hop, log hop and F1 car racing.
Winter Spots are very popular in the North, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan owns about 7,000 islands (the largest as Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the paragraphs/the Japanese island groups, Japan is often called, by geographical position, "the opening"
Taiwan began back in the 15th century when passing English sailors record the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or a beautiful island.
In 1624, Dutch East India founded a foundation in southwestern Taiwan, establishing changes in grain production practices and scoring Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty forces (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coast areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing in the first Sino-Japani war (1894–1895), the Qing government signs the Shimonoseki contract, for which they demonstrate independence over Taiwan to Japan, which leads the island to 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main systems, named Intihuatana, Sun Temple, and Room with Three Windows.
Many homes on the banks of these complex buildings were rebuilt to give tourists a fine image of their original origin.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common photography match is 35 mm, the main size of the film in the old movie era.
It is still released to this day, but more important the ratio of its component is inherited by the feeling of digital camera images.
The 35mm structure is actually confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm in length.
The ratio-speeds of this structure (a twelve division to achieve the easiest ratio of full numbers) then it is said to be 3:2.
Many common designs (APS' family of infrastructure, for example) are similar to or almost equal to this ratio.
A third law used for abuse and ridicule is often a simple guide that creates power while maintaining the standard of plan in the picture.
It says that where there is a significant impact on the main subject is at a line conference that divides the image by a vertical third and a tazari (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was rich and powerful, became under investigation.
for over a thousand years the Christian religion has closed the Uropa states together despite having different languages and rituals.
His widespread power affected all from king to ordinary man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth is to be used to reduce suffering and poverty and that the church's financial treasures are especially there for this reason.
The church's central authority was in Rome for over a thousand years and this presence of power and money in one place led many to ask if this belief was being implemented.
Just after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain introduced a four-level barrier against Germany.
The strategy was effective, to interrupt important military and civil facilities, although this restriction violated international law that is generally approved by several international treaties in the past two centuries.
Britain placed bombs on international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean, thus putting risks even on neutral ships.
Since there was a small response to this strategy, Germany expected similar answers to its untainted wars.
In the 1920s, the attitude of many citizens and nations that ruled was of reconciliation and composer.
Having seen the horror and cruelty of war during the First World War, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept work at Edison in New York City.
He arrived in the United States and just 4 mi, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his role in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each step of China or every family in power was a special dynasty.
Also among each dynasty was a neutral period of divided states. The most popular of these periods was the era of the Three Emirates of Han and Jin.
During these periods a fierce battle took place between the soldiers fighting for the throne.
Three Emirates were the most bloody era in Old China's history, thousands of people died fighting for sitting on the highest seat in Xi'an palace.
There are many social and political impacts such as the use of the metric system, changes from the position of dictatorship to the imposition, nationalism and belief that the country belongs to people not only of one ruler.
Also after the Revolution the work was open to all male applicants, thus allowing the self-dependent and successful.
Also for soldiers because rather than military power to rely on class now depends on praise.
The French revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers to begin their own coup.
Muhammad was very impressed by more than this normal life. He was visiting a cave that became known as "Hira" in the "Noor" mountain (light) by meditation.
The cave itself, which survived the times, gives a clear picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
High above one of the mountains in northern Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if someone knew it was there. Once you have entered the cave, it is completely isolated.
Nothing else can be seen except the clean and beautiful sky above and many mountains around it. Very few of this earth can be seen or heard in this cave.
The great pyramid in Darkness is the only one of seven wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid built by Egyptians in the third century BCE is one of the largest buildings built in honor of Pharaoh who died.
Dark Hill, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Dead Valley has several pyramids (which the main pyramids are larger), several small graves, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was designed to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and pyramids, tombs and many other small temples were built to honor his wives and family members of Khufu.

Above means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means it is appropriate to start on the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow usually produces a quiet voice, with the lower bow strong and stronger.
Feel free to write with a pencil your marks, but remember printed bend marks are due to the music, so it is appropriate for them to be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese 11 years old and four-year-old Louis Charles) and the sister of the terrified king Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles and a crowd of women in the market.
In a wagon, they traveled to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who hit the round and issued threats to the King and Queen loudly.
Crowds forced King and Queen to open their car windows.
At one time the crowd's man waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of a frightened Queen.
The use of war for American imperialism in victory over the Philippines was financed by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to fund much of the spending and interest on bonds imposed by the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, significant benefits from the long-term exploitation of the Philippine people created the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the templar must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which events occurred are commonly known as the Middle High Ages, the period in European history in the 11th Century, 12, and 13 (1000-1300 After Christ).
The Middle High Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Last Middle Ages, which in agreement end about 1500.
Technical classification is a course that includes ananuai in practice, from technology, or technological development in the concept that human fate is governed by the basic logic associated with scientific laws and its manifestations in technology.
Many versions of technological control involve two general views: that technology itself follows more than cultural or political influence, and the technology on the side has "the impact" to communities that are natural, rather than social conditions.
For example, a person might say that the fire leads to road cultivation.
However, the national road system dies economically with only a few cars, so new production techniques are developed to reduce the cost of auto ownership.
The mass ownership of vehicles also leads to many road accidents, which lead to the discovery of new techniques in the treatment of broken bodies.
Aroma had a large component of cultural decisions inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Aroma, geography shaped people, and by the transition of the time the traditions and cultures related to geography arose, and these, in accordance with the social status, were better than random laws.
How Paris is known as the modern world's fashion capital, Constantine was considered the capital of the feudal Uropa style.
It is known as the center of luxury began about 400 A.D. and lasted to about 1100 A.D.
His condition deteriorated during the twelveth century especially due to the fact that religious fighters had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more valuable than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time when the transfer of the City of Fashion from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic Empire peaked in the period between the 10–11 centuries and the 14th century.
Dress was initially influenced by Baizantini cultures from the east.
However, because of poor communication methods, western styles remained behind for 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages in the west began to develop their own statutory, one of the greatest progress of the time as a result of the crusedi people began using buttons to focus on clothing.
Self-season agriculture is a farm that is done with sufficient food production to provide the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-season agriculture is a simple system, a organic, using stored and natural seeds for the area involved, as well as the cycle of plants or alternative methods that are easy to improve the harvest.
Historically, many farmers became involved in self-season agriculture and this is still the situation in many developing nations.
Small culture brings together people of the same approach as they feel isolated from social standards and allows them to promote identity feelings.
Small groups of cultures can be unique due to age, tribe, bridge, territory, and/or gender of participants.
The qualities that make a small culture unique may be linguistic, linguistic, religious, political, geographical or mixed elements.
Members of a small culture often indicate their membership through unique styles that include fashions, behaviour and language.
One of the most popular techniques is determined to show the importance of cooperation is to use a few examples of children who, through neglect, mismissing, deliberate persecution, were not associated with adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "violent" or violent. Other brutal children are imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in this other case the abandonment of children was due to parents ’ rejection of serious mental or physical deficits to the child.
Untouched children may have experienced great abuse or childhood before being released or escaped.
Others are allegedly drunk by animals; others are said to live in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a brutal child reflects character (within physical boundaries) almost entirely like those of a particular animal of care, such as fear or frustration for humans.
When basic project education should make education easier and more interesting, the divinity goes further.
Training techniques are not a method of reading but a service that provides assistance to people who are going through new learning conditions such as using new software or starting a new project.
The rugs can be both clear and real, in other words, the teacher is a type of platform but also the paper channel in Microsoft Office.
The mats Pepe are placed in the program for the purpose of questioning, persuasion, and describing procedures that may have been a major challenge for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in the custody Ministry for many other reasons that come from being abandoned to bullying and even robbery.
No child should grow in an environment that does not care, cares, does not teach, but they do so.
We think the Raising Service System is a safety area for these children.
Child settlements are eligible to provide safe housing, loving adoptive parents, stable education, and a reliable health system.
Child settlements are eligible to provide all these needs that were missing at home where they were given earlier.
The network combines the social and middle-class communication material of the people and the person.
Special behavior of the Internet leads to further measurements on use and satisfying techniques.
For example, "learning" and "competitive" are proposed as important incentives for use of the Internet (James and others, 1995).
Personal participation with "long relationships" was also recognized by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new elements of the motals to investigate the audience's approach on the website.
The use of recording videos has led to significant discoveries in the translation of the sound, the moving face that lasts several seconds.
Hususan, it is claimed that one can recognize if one deceives by interpreting small signs correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his newspaper the President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech from brain damage however they are able to evaluate the truth correctly.
He even suggests that such a ability to interpret human behavior can be associated with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two categories of genetic diversity: hide and described.
Change increases physical differences, and the election removes them from the collection of differences shown.
The changes in the process of the anti-specific and re-consolidation and the mixing of the two pools per generation.
Outside on the savana, it is difficult for the main animals with the digestive system as human beings not to satisfy the needs of their tidal-za-amino from the plant materials in them
In particular, failure to do so has serious consequences: declining growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The resources of easily reached plants would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for those of the high-profile group as we grind unless they were cooked.
By comparison, animal foods (substantial, ants, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also produce high levels of proteins that contain essential amino acids.
If all things are considered, we should not be surprised if our sages solved their "speed protein" in the same way as the savanna monkeys do today.
Sleep interruption is a process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep and sleep shortly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
This can be done with a low - noiseed bell clock to make you conscious without ever waking you up.
If you find yourself reset the bell clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, to get you out of bed to put it off.
Other misundobayological options involve heavy drinking (about water or tea, popular medicine) before going to bed, which requires a person to wake up to go to a small need.
The inner peace rate that a person owns is related to the level of stress within the body and his spirit.
The less appeal is, the positive power of life is, and everyone has the ability to achieve more peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can get an understanding. One thing standing on the way of this goal is our own concern and anger.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but was expanded by the way of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetanism is very simple. You have the Yoga of Kundalini, meditation and the way of love that embraces all.
Through Kundalini's Yoga, the power of Kundalini (light power) is developed through yoga's position, breathing exercises, repeating words or sounds and images.
Tibet's thinking center is Yoga of the Godship. Through the image of various gods the energy methods are refined, the lakra is fed and the consciousness of the conversion is awakened.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to USSR's collaboration with the United States. With the end of the conflict of the system, the process and culture led to the separation of the country.
And two years of the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was last for the next 40 years and would be actually beaten by the military forces, in the war fields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places
By September 17, 1939, Polish protection was broken, and the only hope was to return and re-organize with a Romanian senior bridge.
However, these plans were surpassed by one night, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union Red Army entered and formed the borders of Belarusian and Ukreini after invading eastern Poland by violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Poshi Convention Unviolent, and other international agreements, two sides and many sides.
Using ships to transport goods was the best way to transport crowds and goods to the sea.
The work of the navy has naturally been to ensure that your country has the ability to transport people and your goods, at the same time, to prevent your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable examples is the Northern Atlantic campaign of the Second World War, and Americans were trying to transport people and equipment through the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
Meanwhile, German troops, using submarines, were trying to prevent this friendship.
If the Union failed, Germany could probably win England as it had won Uropa.
The goats likely started domesticing nearly 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagrosi Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them with easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
In general, domestic goats began to be domesticated by wandering groups in the mountains or other pasture areas, with the supervision of guards who were often children or young, similar to well - known shepherds. These farming techniques are still in operation even today.
Horsecars were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although traffic routes were loaded with parallel wood logs, they allowed horses to pull them faster and pull large loads to the rough roads of the day.
Pillars were established so early to hold the railroad in its place, however, as time went on, it was discovered that the tracks would do the best if a piece of iron was placed on top.
This became a custom, but iron caused damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by metal wheels, and in 1767, the first full metal rails were established.
The first known form of transport is walking, binadaum began walking straight two million years ago, after the rise of humans vertically.
Their predecessors, Australopiothecus did not walk as vertical as usual.

Science now suggests that this large carbon economy has removed the world's life from one of its stable conditions that had to hold on to man's evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries it is rare to hear the same levels of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems put feelings on such complaints, why do they die every day? It's that transport engineers cannot? Or is there something more basic to continue?
The Tootball flow is a study of private drivers and cars between two parts and the interaction they do with their counterparts.
Unfortunately, researching the flow of the traffic is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted for a hundred percent sure.
Unfortunately, drivers have certain practices in some agreement; therefore, traffic congestion are certain stability and can be represented in particular.
To represent the flow of the traffic well, the relationship has been established between three main conditions: (1) flow, (2) weight, (3) speed.
